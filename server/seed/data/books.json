    "description": "My name is Larkspur, and I am an Elemental.\n\nMy people use the power of the earth to sustain life and defy our enemies. I should be at my father's side as a royal princess. But as a half-breed, bastard child, that isn't going to happen. \n\nIn a world of lava and fire, I am about to face my hardest trial yet. Not one of strength, or power, but intrigue and manipulation. However, my tolerance level for anyone outside of my family is at an all-time low, and the queen who rules the Pit expects complete obedience.\n\nAs Ash's life is held in the balance, I have just three days to prove his innocence and mine. This place holds more than a scorching heat; new foes, traitors, and creatures from the depths of the lava are all trying to keep us from surviving.\n\nThe only question left. . . Can I get us all out without being burned alive?\n\nWelcome to the Pit.",

        "content": "CHAPTER 1\n\nMagma’s hands dug into my arms, pinning them back at an angle sharp enough that my shoulders threatened to pop out of joint. Around us, the redwoods of the Rim swayed, the trunks groaning as the wind pushed at them. In the distance a long howl of a wolf made me think for just a moment that maybe Griffin would come back and help Ash and me escape the hold the Salamanders—aka fire elementals—had on us. But there was no sound of running pads on the ground, no snarl of a wolf as he attacked our captors to help free us.\n\nI shouldn’t have been surprised. A month past, Ash and I had gone into the fire elementals’ home, the Pit, in search of a cure for the lung burrowers that were wiping out our people. We’d been turned away, but I didn’t take no for an answer. Ultimately, we did find the cure, and our family was saved. But the cost was high and there were several deaths. All at the end of my spear. For a time, I’d thought we’d escaped punishment.\n\nI scanned the forest looking for any sign of movement and saw none; there was no one coming to our rescue, no one coming to tell the Salamanders to let us go. Though we were in the Rim, we were once again on our own. Apparently even my father had given up on me, handing us over to Queen Fiametta and the Pit after specifically telling me he would never do that to any of his children. How quickly things changed in my life and my understanding of those around me.\n\nAgain.\n\nTurning my head slowly, making myself not react to the pain, I glared at Maggie.\n\n“Maggie, we’ve already said we’d go with you.”\n\nShe snorted, her orange eyes narrowing. “Magma, not Maggie, we are not friends.” Her fingernails cut into my bare skin, and trickles of warm blood slid down my upper arms into the crooks of my elbows. “A liar like you can’t be trusted, so I think we’ll be doing things my way.” The other three Enders with her laughed, but I didn’t even look at them. They were not my problem at the moment. She tightened her hold on me as if to emphasize the point that she was indeed in charge.\n\nI made myself smile through the throbbing ache in my upper back and shoulders and took a shot in the dark. “Your fellow Enders don’t think much of you, do they? Letting me slip into the Pit, then escape while you just stood there and watched must have really set you down in the ranks. Especially since I’m just a lowly earth elemental.”\n\nFrom the right of me, Ash let out a low groan. “Lark, don’t push her.”\n\nBut it was too late for taking the words back, and I wouldn’t have anyway, not after everything Ash and I had been through in the Deep. After surviving the world of the Undines—water elementals—I wasn’t sure I had it in me to be patient or forgiving of anyone who didn’t have Terraling—earth elemental—blood running through their veins.\n\nMaggie, Magma to me now if I let her have her way, let out a low rumbling hiss, the sound reminiscent of a bellows in a forge. “When they execute you, the smile on my face will be the last thing you see.”\n\nI looked away from her, but the scene around me didn’t give much hope. The Enders surrounding us were dressed in black from head to toe, their ensembles completed by their long black cloaks, and three-foot-long narrow black clubs that hung from their belts. Unlike our Ender clothes that consisted of dark and light browns, a vest and pants, the Enders from the pit were covered up entirely. Right down to the thick black boots they wore. If it weren’t for their varying shades of brilliant red hair, they would have been monotone from top to bottom.\n\nThe Ender holding Ash glared at me and I realized I knew him too. We’d met before. “Match?”\n\nHe’d been with Maggie when they’d met us at the door of the Pit when all we’d wanted was help from their healers. He’d fought us, as had Maggie, and that started what ultimately led me to kill not one or two, but four of the Pit’s Enders.\n\n“Don’t talk to me,” he growled, baring his teeth at me. “You aren’t getting away from us this time. Your sentencing is going to be swift, and even your king can’t deny us this right.” I realized, as he glared at me, that Maggie wasn’t the only one who’d been made to look like a fool.\n\nMaggie’s words, and his finally, sank into my mind. The sentence for one Ender killing another was very simple. Death at the hands of the offended party, which in my case was the Pit. Magma dragged me forward a few steps alongside Ash. He caught my eye. “Just follow my lead.”\n\nMatch cuffed him in the head, hard enough to split the skin over his left eye. “Shut your filthy mouth, Terraling.”\n\nAsh’s mouth twitched and he glared at Match. “Brave boy now that you have all your friends with you.”\n\nMatch grunted as if he’d been punched. “I warned you.”\n\nThe Ender slid his long black club from his belt and swung it toward Ash. As the club fell, I leapt toward them, dragging Maggie with me a few steps before she let me go. My right shoulder popped out of joint with a tearing crunch but it didn’t stop me. Momentum took over and I crashed into Ash, sending us both to the ground as the club whipped over us. Match let out a roar and I scrambled to stand upright, whimpering as my shoulder socket twisted again.\n\nThe other Enders seemed surprised. As if they couldn’t believe we’d fight back. “Ready to run?” I asked, as I tried to think past the throbbing ache in my shoulder. I backed away from the Enders, pushing Ash with me. If we could get moving, we had a chance at outrunning them.\n\n“Your father said we should go with them without a fight—”"

        "content": "“And you think that’s a good idea?”\n\nAsh didn’t answer and I knew I was right, we both did. My father was not in his right mind; he hadn’t been for a long time. And until the mental wounds Cassava inflicted on him healed, we couldn’t trust him.\n\nWe truly were on our own.\n\nA slow building anger started in my belly and spread outward to my hands where the iron manacles clamped my wrists. I fed the power of the earth inherent to me into the iron, pulling the ore apart, molecule by molecule, until they fell to the ground at my feet.\n\nMaggie stared at me and the curl of red lines, indicators of her power climbing her hand, was the only warning I had that she was about to blast us with her element. Fire danced from her hands and onto the ground around us creating a perfect circle. I flicked my hand and the earth covered the fire, putting it out as easily as breathing.\n\nAt least easy enough when I was angry and I could reach my power. Without anger backing me, I couldn’t tap into the earth and the power within it. A flaw I didn’t know how to change.\n\n“Maybe in the Pit you rule, Maggie. But not here.” She glared at me, and I backed away, bumping into Ash. Except it wasn’t Ash.\n\nIt was another Ender from the Pit, one I didn’t know. He dug his hand into my busted up shoulder, his fingers scooping into the open joint. I screamed, unable to stop the sound from escaping me anymore than I could stop myself from dropping to my knees. The world swayed as the Ender put more pressure on the joint. The sounds of people yelling, and the rush of bodies around us was about all I could make out.\n\nThere was a flash of green and gold and suddenly Fern, my father’s current wife, stood in front of me trying to stop Maggie and the other Enders from the Pit. Her belly swelled with what would be a younger sibling for me, but even so, she fought for us.\n\n“I am the queen here and I forbid you taking my Enders!” she snapped, pointing at Maggie.\n\nGoddess love her, she was trying. Another voice rose in defiance and I could hardly understand what I was seeing.\n\nCoal stood next to Fern, his back to me but I would know him anywhere. My on-again-and-currently-off-again lover whose hand I’d been forced to cut off in order for him to survive the catastrophe that was the lung burrowers. The last I’d spoken with him, he’d gone more than a little crazy. Something that happened often to those elementals who lost a body part.\n\nYet there he was, fighting for me. He put his remaining hand on Match’s chest and shoved. “She’s mine. No one is taking her from me.” Well, there went the warm and fuzzies.\n\nI looked around again, now no stars dancing in front of my eyes. Ash was flat on the ground, his face pressed into the dirt. He wasn’t fighting back though and I knew I couldn’t get us both out of this mess on my own. The pain had overridden the anger and I couldn’t reach my connection to the earth any longer.\n\nThe Ender holding me down squeezed again and I rolled my head back to stare up at him. His red hair was lighter than the others’ from the Pit, almost a blond if not for the distinct red undertones. “Think you can ease up?”\n\nHe grinned at me and I was reminded of Eel, an Undine I’d faced in the Deep who had a penchant for hurting people. “Nah, I like you on your knees in front of me, little Terraling. You look good down there.”\n\nI tried to pull away but he bore down and the world darkened for a moment as the pain consumed my consciousness.\n\nThere was screaming and yelling and I struggled to lift my head because even that movement tweaked the tendons and ligaments I’d torn. Coal picked up Fern and carried her out of the way. His eyes met mine in a brief flash of green. “I’m sorry, Lark. I can’t save you.”\n\nI let out a breath. “You never could. This isn’t anything new.”\n\nHis face hardened, and behind me, the Ender laughed. “Oh, a spunky one. I hope your trial goes for weeks. You know, I’m one of the guards from the dungeons. I’ll be taking care of you. Personally.”\n\nHow was I not surprised?\n\nThings seemed to slow for a moment, and the sound of my heart hammered in my ears as the leather clad Enders parted. My father walked toward us, but I had no hope in him saving us. I’d lost faith in him a long time ago.\n\n“I wish to have a word with my Enders before they go to their punishment,” he said, his normally rich voice holding a distinct tremor to it. Maggie grunted.\n\n“If you try to free them, we will not stand for it.”\n\nHe waved her off as if she were a buzzing gnat, and stopped in front of me. Slowly he dropped to a crouch so we were eye to eye.\n\n“Your Majesty.” I bowed my head.\n\n“Ender Larkspur. I have tried to save you from yourself, but you seem inclined to find trouble wherever you go.” Around us, the Enders shifted their feet, and one even laughed.\n\nMy father drew a breath and the sound of the air in his lungs was a wet rattle. “The mother goddess has commanded you face your destiny in the Pit without interference from me. She has a task for you there, a life to save.”\n\nI raised my head and really looked at him as the finality of his words settled on me. His skin was pale under the perpetual tan and his eyes seemed fogged over; even his clothes hung on his frame. My heart lurched. Had one of the lung burrowers somehow been missed?\n\nAs softly as I could, I spoke. “Are you ill?”\n\nHe bowed his head so our foreheads touched and his words were for my ears alone. “I believe I am dying, Larkspur. There is no cure in this world for what ails me. I do not know why Fiametta sent her Enders for you, as she swore she held no grudge against you or Ash.”"

        "content": "He lifted a trembling hand and cupped the back of my head, holding us tightly together. “Child, be strong, and know that I sorrow for the wrongs done to you, for the first time I see them clearly. I am grateful this illness has come upon me; the fever has wiped away the lies Cassava built in my mind. I will see you when we both walk the far side of the Veil, though I will pray you will not make that journey for a thousand years.”\n\nThroat tightening, I couldn’t speak past the growing lump. Tears tracked my cheeks as he stood and made his way to Ash.\n\n“You have one duty left to you, Ender.” He touched Ash on the shoulder. “You know what it is.”\n\nAsh’s jaw ticked and he gave a slow nod. “It will be done.”\n\nThe king’s hand fell from Ash’s shoulder and Fern ran to him. “You have to stop them.”\n\nHe didn’t stop walking, but his words reached me still. “I have done all I can. They must face this alone.”\n\nThe Enders closed ranks as my father disappeared, Fern clutching at him and Coal following. If nothing else, I would at least be able to say they tried to save us.\n\nAsh lurched forward, and the Enders all focused on him as he grappled with Match. The Ender behind me did nothing but drive his fingers deeper into my shoulder socket.\n\n“You aren’t going anywhere, Terraling. At least, not anywhere you want to be.”\n\nThe scuffle in front of us died down and the Ender’s hand on me tightened right before a flash of black caught the corner of my eye and a club smashed into my skull sending me into oblivion.\n\nThe queen’s chamber was dark, but that didn’t matter. The person whose memories I saw was able to move around with an easy stealth, avoiding the furniture and knickknacks that would give his—and I was sure it was a man’s memories I saw—movements away.\n\n“Damn, woman,” he growled, “where the hell did you hide it?”\n\nHe scoured the room that I could only see in glimpses. It was built in the shape of an octagon, the sides a smooth black stone reminiscent of the clubs the Enders from the Pit used. A bed lay in the middle of the room, spires of black rock curling upward as the four posts and a sheer material that sparkled even in the darkness, draped between them, woven like a spider’s web. If I could have shivered, I would have but trapped in someone else’s memories left me no ability to move.\n\n“Here we go,” he bent near the bed and moved as if to shimmy under it when the sound of sheets sliding about snapped his head up. Peering over the edge of the bed, he stared at his queen. Her red hair was the color of fresh blood, which only accentuated the pale creamy tones of her skin and the deep blue of her eyes. An unusual color in the fire elemental bloodlines. She sat up, the sheet slipping down and pooling around her waist, baring her breasts to the warm air.\n\n“What are you doing in my chambers, Ender?”\n\nHe swallowed. “My queen, I wish only to serve you.” She could fry his ass in an instant and they both knew it. Her ability with lava was unheard of in all the records of their people. For her, the lava was alive, like a beast she’d tamed and would do her bidding even so far as to defy the laws of nature.\n\nThere was only one way he might be able to get out of this alive. As renowned as her ability with the lava was her insatiable libido. “I would serve you in whatever manner you desire of me.” His voice turned husky and he made a bold move, sliding his hand across the sheets to brush his fingers against her bare skin. The top of his hand was scarred, an old wound that hadn’t healed cleanly. Four jagged lines that drew down from between his fingers to the base of his wrist.\n\nShe arched an eyebrow. “Whatever manner I desire?”\n\nHe bowed his head, breathing in the smell of her sheets, wondering if it would be the last thing he ever saw. “My queen, I am yours to command.”\n\nHer fingers dug into his hair and pulled him toward her. “Then pleasure me, Ender. For it has been years since a man was bold enough to brave my chamber without an invitation.”\n\nHe dipped his head taking her mouth in his own as he pressed her to the bed. So he hadn’t found what he was looking for, and his mentor would not be happy, but this was better. With easy access to the queen’s chamber, he wouldn’t be forced to sneak around. He could get all the information his mentor needed, and together they would take Fiametta down. If he got to ride the queen before she was toppled, all the better. She’d never suspect him.\n\nSlipping out of his black leathers he slid under the covers with the queen, his mouth and hands everywhere bringing her to her peak in a matter of minutes—\n\nI let out a groan as I slipped out of the memory, the lingering lust the memories stirred clinging to me. As a half-breed, the child of Spirit side allowed me to see into other people’s memories when we Traveled together. So even though the memory wasn’t a surprise, I still was left disoriented.\n\nA quick glance around showed that except for Ash, Match, and one other Ender who was a woman, we were alone. Whoever’s memories I’d seen had already left the Traveling room so I had no clue who he was.\n\nUndertones of perfumed cherry blossoms tugged at me and I slowly sat up. Back in the Traveling room in the Pit was not a place I had ever wanted to be again. The walls were rounded, as if we sat inside of the world and looked out from the center. If only I could get my hands on a single armband, I’d be able to get both Ash and me out. I glanced around the room, but there wasn’t a band to be had. Damn it.\n\n“They’ve been moved since the last time you were here, Terraling.” The nearly blond Ender swung through the doors and into the room. “So don’t think you’ll be getting one and skipping out. You have an appointment to keep.”"

        "content": "An appointment. Nice way of saying I had an execution hanging over my head and Ash’s. And that didn’t even take into account my shoulder that was pulled apart, or the memories of what I suspected where a traitor to Fiametta swimming around my head.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nMatch pushed Ash ahead of me through the maze that was the Pit. My new friend who seemed to like causing me pain dragged me along behind.\n\nA few minutes in, I had enough energy, and the pain had subsided to a dull throb, allowing me to finally speak. “Do you have a name?”\n\n“Brand.” He jabbed a fist into my lower back, shoving me forward and effectively cutting me off from asking him another question. Which was going to be where had Maggie gone? Not that I thought she’d be any kinder but I was curious as to why she’d left us.\n\nThe Pit was set up like a beehive and with more hallways and doors than actual rooms. Some of the doors opened straight into the Pit itself, a bubbling pool of lava that to anyone not a fire elemental was instant death. At least, that was what I understood. I’d never seen the actual Pit myself, only heard the rumors. For all I knew it could be the size of a mud puddle. Though I doubted that very much.\n\nI tried to pay attention to the number of turns and twists but it was quickly apparent we were deliberately taken on the longest route possible, and I was sure we backtracked at least twice before we stopped in front of what I assumed was our destination.\n\nThe doors were each ten feet across and at least that high. Built out of solid gold, there was a perfect likeness of a wingless serpentine dragon etched into the malleable material. Emeralds for eyes, sapphire scales, and the flame that curled out his mouth was shards of rubies and yellow diamonds. Above the dragon was an inscription:\n\nAll who enter shall be judged, and those found lacking shall be destroyed.\n\n“Wow, that’s comforting.” I couldn’t help the sarcasm dripping from my mouth, it covered the fear that grew in my heart. Ash shifted so he was next to me, our Enders flanking either side of us.\n\n“Trust me, Lark. You have to trust me.” His voice was low, and his hand reached out to brush my fingers. “Can you do that?”\n\n“Enough talking.” Match snapped his club out and drummed the door three times. I looked around while we waited. Behind us were two hulking statues, one of the queen wearing a long dress that billowed out behind her, and next to her was a black panther, sleek and snarling. If I were to guess, I would say the panther was her familiar.\n\nAn answering drumbeat echoed from the other side of the doors. Slowly the golden doors swung inward, cutting the dragon in half. The room was coated in gold, from the floor to the walls to the ceilings. Embedded in the gold was every jewel and precious stone I knew and a few I’d only heard of: diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, amethyst, opals, citrine, malachite, pearls, and so many more scattered about, like they were worth nothing.\n\nThe effect was overwhelming, which I was quite sure was the point. Keeping my chin up despite my shoulder, I walked forward with Ash on my left.\n\nIn the throne ahead sat the woman from the memory I’d seen. Her likeness to the statue outside the doors was impressive.\n\nFiametta. Her hair was bound up on her head in a complicated braid that wove in and out of her crown made of rubies held together by thin strands of gold. Simple in its design, it almost disappeared into the deep red of her hair. Her blue eyes didn’t flicker, didn’t give away even a hint of emotion. She was dressed in black Ender leathers, which surprised me. Was that where she’d started her life? Had she been a princess who’d trained with Enders?\n\nLike me?\n\nWhere the hell had that thought come from? No matter how much my blood may have been royal, I would never really be a princess.\n\nA variety of people filled chairs around the edges of the room. I saw the crown prince, Flint, with his distinctive black streak running through the middle of his bright red hair. He’d flirted with Belladonna, my older sister, when she’d been here. His eyes roved over me and a slow smile spread on his lips.\n\nNot a chance in hell, I glared at him.\n\nTwo other younger children—probably royalty, by the way they glared at us--also had the distinctive black streak through their red hair.\n\nCactus, my childhood friend and confidant, a half-breed like myself, stood against one wall, watching us come in. His eyes met mine and I thought for a moment he tried to say something to me in that look. Perhaps goodbye.\n\nFiametta slowly stood, her body moving with a predatory grace not unlike the black panther at her side. Her familiar let out a jaw cracking yawn and stood with her, its blue eyes as unusual as hers narrowing slightly as it took us in.\n\n“Fiametta, these two will be trouble. You should kill them quickly,” the large predator said.\n\n“Be quiet,” Fiametta said. “I did not ask your opinion.”\n\nThe panther’s teeth snapped shut and it sat. If I didn’t know better, I’d say he was pissed.\n\nFor just a moment, I thought I saw a glimmer of pink waver around the queen’s head. I blinked. Ash stepped forward, blocking my view of Fiametta. “Your majesty, there has been a misunderstanding.”\n\nFiametta let out a long low laugh as she stepped down the final few steps so she was on even ground with us. “Truly? I doubt that very much, Ender.”\n\n“If I could speak with you, I could explain what happened,” he said softly, his blond head bowed in submission. She strode forward, her body lithe and lean, except for her bust, which seemed about ready to pop out of the skintight leathers. Her hand snaked out and she grabbed Ash’s hair at the back of his head jerking his face upright. “Whatever you have to say, do it now, or I will throw you into the Pit and be done with you.”"

        "content": "I couldn’t see his face, couldn’t tell what was going through his mind. Like everyone else in the room, I waited, wondering what the hell he could possibly say that would pull our asses from the fire in the most literal of senses.\n\nAsh slowly spoke, “Your majesty—”\n\n“Cut the worm shit, Ender. Spit out whatever you have to say,” Fiametta said, her voice as cold as the lava flows were hot.\n\n“I am responsible for the four deaths of your Enders. My companion Ender Larkspur did not wield the blade for any of them.”\n\nBefore I could open my mouth to deny Ash’s words, Brand slammed his hand over my lips and whispered in my ear. “Don’t make his sacrifice for nothing.”\n\nFiametta’s eyes slid from Ash to me. “Ender Brand. Let her speak.”\n\nBrand’s one hand found my shoulder again and dug into it. Damn it, how far back had Ash set this up? I thought about him finding me in the forest, how his kiss had felt like a goodbye.\n\nHe’d known they were coming for us, and he’d planned this all along. There was no other explanation.\n\nWith my mouth clear of Brand’s hand, I took a deep breath, knowing what Brand said was true. If I claimed the deaths as my own, I would damn both Ash and myself to swim in the Pit. But if I were still free, maybe I could find a way out for both of us. A slim chance, but more than we’d had before. “You have to give him a trial.”\n\nFiametta arched an eyebrow at me. “I have to do no such thing. He is not of royal blood, and there are witnesses who wish to see him pay for his sins.”\n\nAsh slid in front of me again. “No, I confess to it all. You don’t have to bring the witnesses in.”\n\nBrand held me back as Match pulled Ash away from me. “Hold still, girl.”\n\nI didn’t even realize I was struggling until Brand spoke. I tried again to get loose from him. “You can’t do this!”\n\nFiametta let out a long low laugh. “You believe my Enders’ lives are not worth repercussion? That their lives are worth less than his? I think not, Terraling.” Her eyes blazed. “I lost four Enders. FOUR lives were taken, girl. It is a small penance to pay that he—” she grabbed Ash by the jaw and twisted him around to face me—“pays with his own life. As Enders you are held to higher standards. You of all people should know that. Be glad I do not toss you into the Pit alongside him.”\n\nHorror and guilt flooded me. I was the guilty party and Fiametta was right—there had to be penance for those lives lost. Not by Ash, but by me.\n\nBrand held me and I realized he’d softened his grip on me, steadying me more than holding. “How long?” I whispered the words and for just a moment I thought I saw a flicker of compassion in Fiametta’s eyes.\n\n“Three days. As the sun rises on the third day the lava will be at its hottest peak in nearly three hundred years. Rather fitting for the first execution of an outsider, don’t you think? He will walk into the Pit, or be thrown, if need be,” she said. “And you will be kept in the dungeons. The last thing I need is you causing more trouble.”\n\nBrand cleared his throat. “My queen. I would like to personally offer to watch over her. My wife could use help of a big strong girl like the Terraling.”\n\nHelp? He was asking to use me as a slave while I was here. Slavery was something strictly forbidden by the mother goddess . . . yet I’d seen the rule circumvented in the Deep too.\n\nFiametta tipped her head to one side. “Brand, that is a great task. I do not wish to put your family in harm’s way.”\n\nHe gave me a light shake. “I’ll throw her in the Pit myself if she puts one foot outside the lines.”\n\nThe queen of the Pit smiled softly and pleasure lit her face. “So be it. Let the Terraling work for her time here, and let her watch her companion die.”\n\nBrand tossed me over his shoulder. “Come, my wife needs laundry hand scrubbed.”\n\nHis words were so mundane, so simple that they jarred my brain into action.\n\n“No! Ash, don’t do this. ASH!” I hadn’t meant to scream, and yet, I felt like he was being taken from me and if nothing else, I knew he was meant to be in my life.\n\n“Lark. Please trust me.” Was all he was able to say before he was slammed to the ground, his face pressed against the golden floor, his eyes only a shade lighter than the precious metal as he stared at me.\n\nSick to my stomach, I knew it was my fault he was going to be executed in my place. That was what my father meant when he spoke to Ash. This was his final job, his final duty. To keep me out of the fire. But it was my reckless behavior and decisions that brought us to this point. I had to do something.\n\nBrand packed me out the monstrous double doors, past the statue of Fiametta and her familiar, and to the left of the throne room. We’d only gone a few hundred feet when he put me down. “I’ll take you to the healers.”\n\nI wanted to jerk away from him, pull a weapon and run after Ash. I wanted to break out of the Pit like we’d done before and thumb my nose at them, prove that as earth elementals we were just as strong. Except I couldn’t. I had no weapons and my shoulder was swollen to the size of a small watermelon. Getting my joint back into place was going to be like jamming an elephant into a keyhole. “Why are you doing this?”\n\nBrand put a hand on the back of my neck and shoved me forward. “Move.”\n\n“Tell me what the hell is going on!” I yelled and he slammed me forward, my face and body pressed against the wall, his knee jammed into my lower back."

        "content": "“So impetuous. I see why he had problems training you.” His mouth dropped to my ear and his whisper was harsh against my skin. “Ash is taking the rap because he couldn’t protect your mother and little brother years ago. He’s paying the penance for their lives, Larkspur. And I’m helping him because he’s my friend and I trust him when he says you are more important than any of us realize.” He eased off me and I slowly turned. His eyes were serious and no longer the lecherous leer he put on before. It had all been an act.\n\n“He said all that?” I put a hand to my head. “Brand, those Enders wanted to kill us. We had to fight or we would have died.”\n\nHe nodded, his orange eyes narrowed under lowered brows. “I know. We have a problem in our ranks. Which is the other reason I’m helping you. Come, the first thing is taking care of your arm. Then we can discuss how we’re going to clear out the snakes in our nest.”\n\nBrand waved me ahead of him and I carefully walked where he wanted. The things Brand said swirled in my head and I struggled to think straight around the pain radiating from my shoulder. The rod of Asclepius floated into view. A snake wrapped around a rod embedded into the door: the mark of the healer’s rooms. My vision blurred and the snake seemed to move as I fell under the tightening net of pain that drove deep into my body, and my legs buckled.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nI lay flat on my back for the second time that day, staring at the ceiling while Smit, one of the Pit’s healers, worked on my arm. He’d helped me before, when Ash and I had broken into the Pit. His hands were gentle as he manipulated my arm. “I’m going to force it back into the joint, and there are no two ways about this. It’s going to hurt.”\n\nI must have nodded because he looked away from me for a second and then Brand was holding me down. My mind raced with possibilities of how I was going to get both me and Ash out of the Pit. Most pressing was how in the name of the mother goddess was I going to pull Ash out of the fire he’d flung himself into. Smit lifted my hand and I drew in a slow breath. With a twist and a hard push, he forced my shoulder back into joint. There was a click and a slight crunch, then a soft pop as the ball slid back into the socket.\n\nFor a split second I thought it wasn’t so bad, but the pain was slow in coming and when it hit I was glad Brand’s hands held me down. I writhed under the pain, the wave of adrenaline, relief, and feeling of sharp knives all jabbed into me and was too much to contain. Biting down on a cry, I slowly relaxed as my body eased to the bed once more.\n\nBrand patted me on my good shoulder. “Now we’re ready to go.”\n\nI sat up and the world spun. I thought I saw a flicker of gray and white fur.\n\nSmit let out a laugh. “What are you doing here, Peta? I thought the queen had you banished.”\n\nBlinking, I stared down at my feet into the bright green eyes of Peta in her house cat form. When she wanted to, she could shift into a snow leopard. As a familiar, she was supposed to protect and watch over the powerful elemental she was assigned to. In her case, the last Salamander she’d protected died in the Deep. Which was where I’d met her.\n\nBut she saved my ass twice and I wouldn’t forget that, or show her disrespect in any way. “Hello, Peta.” I slid to the side of my bed leaving room for her to leap up. Her green eyes didn’t blink even once.\n\n“Dirt Girl. I see you’re in trouble again.”\n\nBrand grunted. “Cat, you’re pretty damn mouthy for one on the edge of being booted out.”\n\nPeta let out a sneeze that could have been a snort, and wiped a paw over her face. “Please. Just because I’ve always been assigned to idiots is not my fault.”\n\nI dropped my feet to the floor. “Good luck with your next fire assignment then. I hope they are smarter than your last.”\n\nBrand tipped his head to the left and walked away, I followed. Or would have. A tiny set of claws dug into my lower leg. I stopped and once more looked down. “What do you want, cat?”\n\nThose glittering green eyes narrowed as she let go of me.\n\n“Dirt Girl, I’m going to need that luck. The mother goddess has given me my new assignment already and I don’t like it.”\n\nI threw my one good arm into the air. “Wonderful. Good luck. I have to go, things to do.” With that I strode away. What the hell did the cat want anyway? There was nothing I could do about her assignment no matter how bad it was. Damn, unless she was spying on me for her new master. I looked over my shoulder, but didn’t see her.\n\nFollowing Brand through the twists and turns of the Pit, I was surprised where he took me. The hallway opened and overlooked a cavern whose ceiling rose hundreds of feet above our heads. From where we stood, I could have jumped to the floor easily. But it wasn’t the height that caught my eye, or even the sheer size of at least thirty acres hidden within the mountain.\n\nAround the edges of the cavern, homes snuggled into the rock walls, and out front in tiny boxed gardens plants struggled to survive. Children played and women laughed as they went about their daily routines. The sounds of music and singing floated in the air. A true village filled with Salamanders carrying on life.\n\nThrough the village, a river of lava flowed, gurgling like a brook, heat bubbles erupting here and there. Even at the distance I was, the heat felt unreal. As soon as sweat popped out on my skin, it began to dry.\n\nA child, a little girl with pigtails and pale pink dress, ran for the edge of the lava flow and I couldn’t help but suck in a sharp breath. She would be burned to a crisp if someone didn’t stop her. I took a step and Brand grabbed me as he chuckled. I whipped my head around to stare at him. “How can you laugh?”"

        "content": "“Just watch, Terraling.”\n\nI spun back to see the child dip her hands into the molten mass and hold it up . . . giggling while she did so. Two more scoops and she moved the small amount of lava to a hole she dug and poured it in. Mother goddess, she was playing in it.\n\nI swallowed hard. It was one thing to know Salamanders dealt with the fire, but another to see a child play in an active lava flow.\n\n“Come, meet my family.” Brand started down a set of steps cut into the mountain that led us on a switchback path to the floor. A soft meow snapped my head around as we reached the bottom. Peta stood at the top of the stairs.\n\nBrand snorted. “We don’t need you following us, bad luck cat.”\n\nShe didn’t answer, just leapt from the stair to my shoulders where she landed easily and I fought not to crumple under her tiny weight, my bad shoulder reminding me it needed time to heal.\n\nPeta balanced there, her tiny feet somehow impossibly heavy on my tender shoulder. “I told you I had a new assignment.” Her eyes stared into mine, glittering with her obvious distaste and the realization of what she said slammed into me.\n\nI lifted my hands as I sputtered. “No, you’re kidding me right? I don’t need a familiar.”\n\nBut as I said it, I knew I was wrong. A familiar was the one soul I could depend on, the one soul that would have my back no matter what. But . . . “Peta, you must be mistaken, you’re meant for a Salamander. Not . . . me.”\n\nShe draped herself across my shoulders and the warmth of her body eased the ache in my injured shoulder. Her tail tickled down the front of my neck as it twitched. “I didn’t ask for this. If you have a complaint, get in line to take it up with the mother goddess.”\n\nI turned to see Brand staring at us with wide eyes. “I’d get in line. That cat has lost more of her charges than any familiar in the Pit. Seriously, that cat is bad luck.”\n\nPeta gave a barely felt shiver and I lifted a hand to her, putting one palm against the silken fur along her back. A simple choice lay in front of me. If Peta truly was my familiar, I didn’t want to have the kind of relationship she’d had with Loam, her previous charge. I wanted to have her on my side, a friend and confidant.\n\nI lowered my hand. “She saved me twice already, Brand. If the mother goddess feels I am deserving of her then I am grateful.”\n\nThe twitching of her tail eased and she let out a soft breath against my neck but said nothing more. I took a step, feeling the change in my balance with her along for the ride. Three steps and I had it, walking as normally as if I’d always had a cat riding on my shoulders.\n\nBrand arched an eyebrow and then shrugged. “It’s your life, but I’ll tell you now that my wife won’t be happy to have her in the house.”\n\nMy jaw tightened but I kept my mouth shut. I would need help to get Ash out alive and that meant for the moment I needed to keep Brand happy. As an Ender, he would have access to weapons and understood the layout of the Pit. My mind worked all the possible details, but the whole of it came to a simple piece. I had to find the armbands used for Traveling, steal them, and then break into the dungeon to get Ash. From there, we would get to the Traveling room.\n\nA walk in the park on a sunny morning couldn’t be easier. And maybe if I told myself that enough, I’d believe it.\n\nBrand led the way to a bridge that arched high over the lava, but even with that distance the heat was intense and my skin tightened as the moisture was quickly sucked out of me. I hurried across, passing Brand and not caring that he grinned at me. “Too much?”\n\nA quick nod was all I gave him. Suddenly going back to the Deep for a swim in the Caribbean waters wasn’t looking too bad. If you discounted the sharks, Kracken, crocodiles, and tsunamis. On the far side of the bridge stood a large statue carved out of an opalescent white stone I didn’t recognize. The creature, a sinuous dragon, reached at least three times my height. I put a hand to it. “What is this?”\n\nBrand stopped a few feet ahead of me. “A symbol of our world.”\n\n“No, I meant the stone.”\n\n“Don’t know, no one does. The statue has been there as long as Salamanders have existed in this mountain.”\n\nHe walked on.\n\n“Guess that means this conversation is done,” I mumbled. Peta snorted.\n\nWe passed several homes and all activity slowly stopped. The women stood and stared at me, not bothering to hide the distrust, and in several cases, outright hate in their strange orange eyes.\n\n“Be wary, Dirt Girl. You killed four men and these women know it,” Peta said.\n\nI tried to swallow past the guilt rising in me. “Were they married?”\n\n“One of them was,” Brand said, “He had a child on the way.”\n\nAbsolute sorrow washed through me and I stopped where I was, struggling to breathe. Those deaths had been necessary to save my family, but knowing I’d stolen a father from his unborn child? That was not who I was, I would never willingly hurt someone like that.\n\nAnd yet I had done it without a thought. Without a care of who else I might affect as my spear thrust forward. “Mother goddess.” I leaned forward, putting my hands onto my thighs as the truth settled on me like a weight. I should be the one in the dungeon, awaiting my execution.\n\nPeta butted her head against my ear, gaining my attention. “You do what you must to survive. We all do, Dirt Girl. That you feel their loss . . . that is good. When you stop feeling the pain of your actions . . .that is when you must be afraid. When you no longer care if you kill, then we have a problem.”"

        "content": "Slowly I straightened. “Take me to her.”\n\nBrand shook his head. “No. She is crazed with her loss.”\n\nAnger kissed at my heels and I used it to tap into my element. Pulling on the earth was easy here, deep in the mountain. The rock around me rumbled, and the women approaching backed away. I lifted a hand and touched one of Peta’s front paws. “Peta. Do you know where she is?”\n\n“Brand is right. Now is not the time. Later perhaps.”\n\nI let out a slow breath, thinking about the little I knew of familiars. My training was sparse, but I did recall my father pointing out that his two familiars were to act as guides when he needed them. A voice of reason. Which explained why he’d sent them away when Cassava was in charge.\n\nA second breath escaped me. “All right, Peta.”\n\nShe startled on her perch. “You’re listening to me?”\n\nI shrugged, immediately regretting the movement. With a pained grimace, I stood next to Brand. “That is part of your job, isn’t it? To advise me?”\n\n“Yes, but . . . rarely does anyone abide by their familiars. It’s why so few of us are connected to elementals now. Even the queen discounts Jag.” Her teeth clicked shut on the last word like she’d said more than she’d planned. Jag, that must have been the panther at the queen’s side.\n\nWe were quiet as Brand led the rest of the way to his home. On the exterior, it looked like all the other homes, bare, sparsely carved, set deep into the wall, and a scraggly garden with only a few shoots of green. But when we stepped through the doorway, the room was alight with a fire burning in the large hearth directly across from us (which I hoped was for cooking and not additional warmth) and light coming from the ceiling. I stared up at the light, trying to understand how it was possible.\n\n“Light tubes, they bounce the sunlight down to us, and it’s how we grow our fruits and vegetables, as meager as they are,” a soft, whispery voice said. I lowered my eyes from the tube to see a woman who matched the tones of her words. Her body was narrow and looked more like that of a Sylph’s with her almost frail bone structure. Most Salamanders were solid of build, not unlike my family. But she was almost petite. Of course, her bright red hair a shade that resembled a tulip marked her for her bloodline. That and her pale yellow eyes. Not gold like Ash’s, but a true yellow, like a cat’s.\n\nShe held out her hand, palm up. “My name is Smoke.”\n\n“Put your hand over hers, palm down,” Peta whispered in my ear.\n\nI did as told, my palm brushing against Smoke’s. “I’m Lark.”\n\nBrand grunted. “She knows who you are.”\n\nSmoke pulled her hand back. “Are you hungry? I imagine after your journey you might be.” Her eyes flicked to Peta, but she said nothing.\n\n“Thank you, yes.” The whole conversation felt false, like we said things only to cover the empty space, to keep the silence from creeping in. But why?\n\nA pounding of feet on rock spun me around and my hands went to my waist for a spear not there. Three boys ran into the eating area from deeper within the home. Each of them had Smoke’s bright red hair, but they were built like their father and they all had his eyes. They stopped as a unit, staring at me.\n\n“Wow, she’s really pretty,” the smallest of the three boys said, and I liked him immediately. Peta snorted softly.\n\n“Typical male.”\n\nBrand dropped a hand on the largest of the three boys who almost matched him in size despite the fact he was obviously not fully grown, his arms and legs gangly. “These are our boys. Stryker, Cano, and Tinder. They were supposed to be out of the house for the day, but it looks as though they heard their mother say something about food.”\n\nThe smallest boy who’d said I was pretty, Tinder, looked up at his father. “We just wanted to see her. We’ve never met a Terraling. And why has she got one of our cats with her?”\n\nPeta yawned wide enough that her tiny jaws cracked. “Because no one else could look after her.”\n\nThe boys nodded as if what Peta said made perfect sense, and then they scooted outside, their mother shouting after them. “Stryker don’t let Tinder near the flows or the Pit! No swimming today!”\n\nBrand glanced at his wife. “Why can’t they go to the Pit?”\n\nHer brow furrowed. “I just do not want them going. I have a bad feeling about the Pit right now.”\n\nBrand nodded, obviously trusting his wife’s intuition. I looked at Peta but she wouldn’t meet my gaze.\n\n“Listen to your mother. No swimming!” Brand said.\n\nThere was a chorus of groans from the three boys, and then silence. Brand let out a slow breath. “Sit down, Lark.”\n\nI sat, though I perched on the edge of the chair. “I’m not leaving without him, Brand. You can either help me find a way to free him, or I will find it on my own.”\n\nBrand looked from his wife to me. “Three days isn’t enough time in the world to come up with a defense for an Ender who has admitted to a crime, and you must do that while looking as though you are helping Smoke. That is your only cover while you are here.”\n\nDrawing in a deep breath, I reluctantly nodded. “I know, but I think I have someone who can help, someone who knows the ins and outs of the Pit.”\n\nThe only question was, would Cactus be willing to help me again? Or would he, once more, find his allegiance with this side of his bloodline?\n\nBrand looked to his wife. “I know about your friend. Cactus barely escaped punishment for the help he gave you the last time you were here. But even if he won’t help you, I will. Ash spoke highly of you, of your sense of justice. We need your help, Terraling. Our queen does not see the danger around her and we are all bound to her, unable to make her see.”"

        "content": "“You think I would help her? When she threatens to kill my friend? Without even a trial?” The question popped out of me before I could stop it.\n\nA snort escaped the Ender as he leaned back in his chair. “For justice, I think you will. If Ash is right about you that is. He told me about you and Queen Finley, how you saved her from the usurper in the Deep. Would you truly leave someone you could help behind?”\n\nIf Ash was right about me. The words echoed in my brain. I wasn’t sure I was willing to help, not after the Deep. And Finley was a little girl, no matter how much power she had within her, she’d needed someone to help her. Fiametta was a full-grown bitch.\n\nBut Brand wouldn’t help me rescue Ash if I said no to his request.\n\n“All right, I will help,” I said, the lie hard on my tongue. Peta tightened her claws into me and I couldn’t look at her, afraid she would see the dishonesty.\n\nShe laid her head down on my shoulder. “Dirt Girl, you are going to get us both killed.”\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nBrand drummed his fingers on the table. “I promised Ash I would remove you from the Pit the second I could. So when you see him, you will have to explain we weren’t able to get out right away.”\n\n“You want me to lie to him,” I said, leaning back in my seat and crossing my arms. Peta snorted and I fought not to cringe. Only moments before I’d lied to Brand and now I was calling him out for the same thing.\n\nSmoke pushed a platter of food in front of me. “Eat, then we can discuss this once you have a full belly.”\n\nWith a grunt, Brand dug into the food and I followed his lead, trusting that Peta would say something if I broke some sort of taboo.\n\nThe food was nothing short of amazing. Sticky rice covered in a thick, spicy sauce alongside chunks of mango and pork was spooned onto my plate. Within two bites, sweat broke out on my brow, but it was good, the warmth filling me. I ate three plates’ worth before pushing it away and reaching for a pewter cup of what I thought was water. I had two gulps before my tongue registered milk, with ice cubes clinking in it to add to the chill.\n\n“It will soothe the fire in your mouth.” Smoke smiled, her lips curling up at the edges only a little.\n\n“Thank you.” I took another gulp and held the cup up to Peta, tipping it so she could reach the milk. She paused and stared at me a moment before she stuck her head in and lapped it up. Brand stopped eating, his mouth hanging open and his fork halfway to his mouth.\n\nI looked from him to Smoke. “What?”\n\nShe dropped her eyes, that small smile ghosting across her lips.\n\n“Nothing.” He shook his head several times and went back to eating. What the hell had I done now?\n\nSmoke let out a soft breath. “Sharing food with your familiar means you have accepted her as your own. It is surprising, that is all. How long has it been, Peta, since your charge actually accepted you?”\n\nPeta pulled her head out, milk clinging to her whiskers in tiny white droplets. “That is enough for me, Dirt Girl.” She didn’t answer Smoke’s question. Though I was curious about Peta’s past charges, it wasn’t high on my priority list.\n\nI tipped the cup and drank the last of the milk, my argument ready. “Brand, if you are truly Ash’s friend, you know he didn’t kill those Enders. You know he doesn’t deserve to die for a perceived mistake that happened years ago. It wasn’t his fault my mother and brother were killed on his watch. That was all Cassava’s doing. He’s a good man and this is wrong on all levels.”\n\nA low grumbling breath escaped the Ender across from me. “Those things are true, but I am tied to this family which is why I need you to help me, I cannot go against Fiametta’s wishes any more than you can go against your king’s.”\n\n“That’s ridiculous, you aren’t a slave,” I snapped. “You’re just using that for an excuse not to do what’s right.”\n\nBrand leaned forward, one eyebrow raised high enough that it nearly touched his hairline. “Have you not gone through your trial with the mother goddess? You must have if you are an Ender.”\n\nI frowned. “Of course I have. What has that to do with this?”\n\nHe placed his broad hands on the table. “Then you swore to uphold your family in all things, swore your life to them, and to obey your king no matter what he would ask of you.”\n\nWell, worm shit and green sticks, what did I say to that? I had sworn nothing of the kind. The mother goddess had helped me past the block Cassava placed on my abilities, and sent me back.\n\nI must have been silent too long.\n\nPeta’s claws dug into me. “Dirt Girl.”\n\nI cleared my throat and slowly shook my head. “No. The mother goddess didn’t have me swear to anyone.”\n\nBrand looked at his wife who stared at me. “Then you,” she said softly, “are in a very unique position. You are not tied by those bonds all other Enders are. Brand cannot help you, which is exactly why he needs you. But I can. I am no Ender and have no unbreakable bonds.”\n\nBrand grunted as if she’d kicked him in the balls. “Smoke, we’ve discussed this already. I don’t want you getting tangled in this. Fiametta is ready to blow, and I don’t want her seeing you as an enemy.”\n\nSmoke cleared the plates. “Our queen is always on edge. It is her nature. She is like a mountain perpetually threatening to burst its seams.”\n\nI stood, pushing my chair back, questions swirling, one in particular. “Why would you two help me? I’ve killed four of your Enders.” There, I said it out loud."

        "content": "“Have you? Where are the bodies, Terraling?” Smoke’s eyes bore into mine and I saw the keen mind behind the quiet movements and frail bones. “If there are no bodies, how is it proof you killed them?”\n\nIn a strange way, she was right. There was no evidence if there were no bodies. But I thought there was more to what she was saying. “What happened to the bodies? Or are you saying they didn’t die?” No death would mean no punishment. I would just have to find them.\n\n“I was there, one of Smit’s helpers. Those four Enders are dead, Lark.”\n\nThere went that idea.\n\nShe continued. “But their bodies were put immediately into the Pit. Without burial.”\n\n“Like something was being hidden,” Peta said. A shiver slipped up and down my spine and I wriggled my shoulders trying to dissipate the feeling. Those were my thoughts exactly. The only reason to throw bodies into the Pit immediately would be to hide something. Like how they died.\n\nWhich made no sense if I was the one who’d caused the deaths, wouldn’t they want the evidence preserved?\n\nSmoke wiped her hands on her pants. “Come, let us walk together, we can discuss what must be done first.”\n\nBrand stood slowly. “You two be careful. And take the laundry with you or what little cover you have for taking her out will be blown.”\n\nThat was right, I was supposed to be a helper while I was in the Pit. Smoke pointed to a woven basket heaped with clothes. “Lark, take the basket. I will take the rocks.”\n\nI scooped up the basket and Peta leapt into it, perched on top like a tiny feline queen. Smoke gathered four smooth, flat rocks shaped perfectly to fit into the hand, used for beating the clothes clean.\n\nShe went to her husband and kissed him lightly on his lips. He reached out to her and touched her face, his hands so gentle for their size. I felt as though I was seeing something intimate, and not meant for my eyes as they whispered their goodbyes. “Be careful, my sweet firebrand,” he said softly.\n\nWe left the home and started across the cavern in silence. Around us, the hum of activity continued as people’s lives carried on in the daily grind. But they were happy. I had to give them that. Very different from the atmosphere I’d experienced in the Deep where the Undines had been terrified to even speak, never mind laugh and sing.\n\nThe woven basket pressed into my hip, shaping itself to my curve. Peta bobbed along with my steps, her eyes flicking around the cavern. She lifted her head, stretching her neck, her eyes wide.\n\nI looked in the direction she stared. A small figure darted along the wall, paralleling us. Dressed in black from head to toe, it probably stood as high as my shoulder, at most. “Smoke . . .”\n\nShe stopped, glanced quickly at the figure and then away, a light shiver running through her. “They have been seen, two cloaked figures darting about the caves and where they go, disaster follows any who interact with them. Avert your eyes, Terraling. You do not want her to notice you.”\n\nSmoke put a hand on my arm and tugged me in the opposite direction, but I couldn’t help but stare over my shoulder. The dark figure paused at an entranceway and turned back. A low laugh rumbled as the silhouette lifted a hand to me with a jaunty wave.\n\nIf it weren’t for the heat of the cavern, the cold chill that hit me would have been overwhelming. Something about the way the figure waved, the tilt of the head . . . there was a dark familiarity about them. “Let me guess, that is part of the problem Brand spoke of.”\n\n“No, the ghosts have come and gone for years.” Smoke directed me toward a set of stairs that took us down to a lower plateau in the cavern. “They are problematic and they bring trouble wherever they go. But they cannot be caught, because they aren’t tangible, so there is nothing we can do about them.”\n\nWhich told me the Salamanders had in fact tried to catch the ghosts and failed. Pride was a funny thing with fire elementals, and I wasn’t about to argue that the “ghosts” were probably not ghosts at all. The figure had been too solid, too real to be anything as intangible as a specter.\n\nThe farther away we got from the main lava flow, the easier the air was to breathe, the less my sweat dried and the cooler I became. Steam rose ahead of us, and the sound of a burbling river pooled in my ears. A sound that almost felt like home.\n\n“Terraling, traitors are in our midst,” Smoke said softly, her words barely loud enough to be heard over the water and I realized why she brought me here. Even side-by-side, our words were drowned in the sloshing of water over rocks and the bubble of steam.\n\nSmoke led me to the edge of the river and dropped to her knees. I did the same, so our legs pressed hard against each other. The sand below me cushioned my knees and it was then I noted it wasn’t sand but a pale gray ash. Handing Smoke some of the clothes, I took one of the shirts and dunked it in the water, using the rocks and ash to get it clean. A task I’d done a thousand times in my life already, and I fell into it with ease.\n\n“They are trying to bring down our queen. Brand believes it is one of the Enders who is setting this up.”\n\nRolling the cloth in my hands, I pressed it between my knuckles and scrubbed at the stain I’d seen. The water was hot to the point of turning my skin bright pink, and I dunked the shirt into it several times. The memory I’d seen as we Traveled to the Pit was fresh in my mind. But I couldn’t just spit out I’d seen the traitor in action.\n\n“I think he’s probably right. It would make sense from the angle of getting close to her. Who would benefit from her being killed? Her oldest son?” The answer was obvious to me, Fiametta’s son, Flint, would be the heir, no doubt. With her out of the way, he would rule. Open and shut case, why did they need me?"

        "content": "Smoke shook her head. “While he might try to rule, our family has always been led by a test of strength. Fiametta was an Ender when the old queen died. A series of games and challenges were set up by the old queen, and those who wanted to rule had to survive. Fiametta was the last one standing.” She paused and splashed the shirt she was washing deep into the water, swirling the ash out of it. “Her son is weak in his power, and in his head. He is too caught up in his own vanity to be of any use to anyone. He knows he will never rule.”\n\nShe offered me one of the flat rocks and I used it to pound a pair of pants.\n\nThere was still something I didn’t understand. “What has happened to make you think there is a traitor, though?”\n\nSmoke’s head lowered. “The lava flows. They are doing strange things, burning people when they shouldn’t. Nothing serious, but you have to understand, Terraling, we don’t burn. The lava, fire, it is our element. It is our home. And it is turning on us. Fiametta says she has it under control, but Brand has seen her battle the lava. Seen her buckled under its power and close off whole sections of the Pit because she can’t stem the flow. And again, there are strange burns. Always it happens around the Pit, as though that is the epicenter.”\n\nPeta sat in the now empty basket, her eye peering at me over the edge. “There is more. Something with the night bells has shifted. People are sleeping longer, and are harder to wake up. I have seen that, too.”\n\nI opened my mouth to ask her what she meant by that. What did bells have to do with sleep?\n\nWithout warning, the ground under my knees heaved upward, throwing me forward, head first into the steaming river. The water tumbled me like the clothes we’d been cleaning, driving me to the bottom of the river where the water was cooler and I wished I had my hooked earring that allowed me to breathe water as if it were air. But I’d lost that in the Deep.\n\nSlowly I was pushed downstream, the rocks at the bottom seemed to hold me to the streambed. No, that was what was happening. The rocks were piling on my legs and torso, keeping me under the water; drowning me even as the water shoved me closer to the intersection where the lava flow met the river.\n\nWorm shit didn’t begin to describe the trouble I was in. I clawed at the river bottom, digging my heels in to stop my forward momentum. Rocks flipped up and crashed onto me, smashing me in the head, chest and stomach, knocking the wind out of me. I fought not to breathe in the water, to hold what was left of my air as my lungs burned.\n\nI flailed, fighting with everything I had, but the more I fought, the more the earth itself tried to kill me.\n\nWait. The earth wasn’t trying to kill me. A Terraling was. Anger snapped through me, allowing me to grab hold of the power of the earth. I pushed it through the rocks, breaking them into sand. With the weight removed, the water slung my body toward the lava flow. Around me, the water heated with each second. I swam hard against the current as I pushed off the bottom.\n\nBreaking through the surface, I gasped in a breath and dared a look behind me. The steady glow of lava and the steaming hiss of the river as it met its brother were far too close.\n\nIn the distance, Smoke ran toward me, but she wouldn’t make it in time, and I would burn up in a matter of seconds. Would Fiametta let Ash go when I died? I hoped so.\n\n“Dirt Girl, swim to the edge and don’t dawdle.” Peta snapped me out of my state of near death musing.\n\nI swam toward the shoreline, and was losing more ground to the river, but I knew Peta was right. This was my only chance. She was in her snow leopard form, keeping pace with me on the edge of the riverbank, her round ears pinned back and her eyes narrowed against the steam. The water temperature approached the boiling point. I was slowly cooking, my skin tingling with the near scalding water. I slipped below the water. Peta’s green eyes locked on mine.\n\n“I’m sorry,” she said. I was dying and she felt bad. Bet I was her shortest lived charge. I wanted to tell her it was okay, that I wasn’t really hurting. As a way to die, apparently boiling alive wasn’t all that bad. I might have said something along those lines to her, but I wasn’t sure. I couldn’t feel much of anything.\n\nA fierce, sharp pain sliced into my right hand and a tugging sensation pulled on me. Someone hoisted me out of the water. The pain in my hand eased and then replaced by an even deeper pain in the same place. Like blunted knives driven between the bones in my hand while crunching down on them with a tremendous force.\n\nI screamed then realized Peta had dragged me out of the water at the last second, first with her claws, and then her teeth. I lay on my back staring at the cavern ceiling, noticing all the light tubes pointed at us, making it daylight deep with the mountain.\n\n“Dirt Girl. If you decide to go swimming, perhaps a less dangerous place would be good, eh?” Peta snapped at me as she paced by my head. “Is it not enough everyone thinks I’m bad luck? To lose you on the first day I’m assigned to you would be the end of my reputation completely. How could I ever show my face again?”\n\nI reached to her with my good hand. “Thanks for saving me. That’s three times now. You must like me.”\n\nShe snorted. “Why did you dive in?”\n\nEasing myself into a sitting position, I put a hand to my head. “I didn’t. Someone pushed me.”\n\n“No one pushed you. I was right there,” she snapped at me again with her words and her teeth.\n\n“A Terraling pushed me, using the ground to unbalance me.” I backed away from the river, not wanting a repeat. “And they tried to hold me to the bottom of the river.”"

        "content": "Peta stopped pacing. “One of your own?”\n\nI nodded. “You aren’t the only bad luck around here, Peta. I’m not well liked within my own family or the Pit.”\n\n“Wonderful,” she muttered, her body shimmering lightly as she shifted to her housecat form.\n\nMy whole body tingled from the heated water, but slowly the discomfort faded, and my skin went from a brilliant shade of pink to its natural tones. Healing as an elemental was usually fast, but I didn’t think this was all on me, not when my hand that Peta had bitten was stitching itself back together.\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n“I’m letting you draw on me. That is what elementals do; they allow their charges to be stronger, faster, and heal at a speed that keeps them alive. Or is supposed to, anyway.”\n\nI frowned. “Well, stop it. I don’t want to draw from you.”\n\nShe frowned at me. “Too good to draw from a cat?”\n\nThere wasn’t a chance to answer her as Smoke reached us, out of breath. “Why in the world did you jump into the river?”\n\nPeta shook her head slightly and I lowered mine as I cradled my clawed and bitten hand. “I didn’t mean to, I stood and then stumbled forward. I’m a klutz, always tripping on things.”\n\nI dared a look up. Smoke wasn’t buying it, as she placed her hands on her hips. “Did you make eye contact with her?”\n\nI blinked several times as I tried to process who she meant. “Her?”\n\n“The smaller specter. Did you make eye contact with her?”\n\nShivering, my body cold after being in the superheated water, I nodded. “I did.”\n\n“Well, that explains it, then.” Smoke held a hand out to me as if the conversation and what had happened was all over. And maybe for her it was.\n\nFor me though, her words started a chain reaction in my head. The specter seemed familiar to me, and then a Terraling tried to kill me. Cassava was still in hiding after her failed attempt at taking the throne at the Rim, but could she be here, looking for revenge? Or maybe looking for a way to convince Fiametta to help her? They were friends, I knew that, so Cassava being in the Pit in hiding was more than plausible.\n\nStanding, I followed Smoke to the laundry and helped her pile it into the basket.\n\n“That is enough excitement for one day,” Smoke said.\n\nPeta snorted. “It’s not over yet.”\n\nSmoke’s body stiffened. “Ah, mother goddess, this is not good.”\n\nI looked over her to several women who strode toward us. The one in the lead was very pregnant and had dried tear tracks streaking her cheeks.\n\nMy familiar leapt to my shoulder. “That is the wife of one of the Enders you killed.”\n\nHeart sinking to my feet, I lowered the basket. I’d caused this pain, no matter the reason behind it.\n\nI let out a slow breath. “Whatever comes of this, I will take.”\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nSmoke tried to stop them, but was pushed aside by the woman in front. “Out of our way, half-breed freak.” Smoke stumbled, going to her knees in the soft ash at the edge of the bank, but she wasn’t hurt.\n\nI held my ground as the pregnant woman reached me. Her eyes were bloodshot with tears, the pale yellow irises that of a weak flame. It looked as though she’d shorn her hair herself, and I vaguely recalled something Salamanders did when they were grieving.\n\n“You are the Terraling who stabbed my mate?” The words bubbled out of her alongside more tears.\n\nI nodded. “I am.”\n\nHer slap was hard, and snapped my head to the side. A second and third slap followed close on its heels, my still aching skin screaming to back away. But I didn’t move. She collapsed forward, surprising me. I caught her and lowered her to the ground as her sobs shook her unwieldy frame. Her hands dug into my arms as she clung to me, her grief overtaking her.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” I whispered, the memory of my own losses allowing me to understand how deep the pain would go. How it burrowed into your bones and stole a piece of you that you didn’t even know existed. A piece that once gone could never be replaced, but only seen from a distance as other people lived their lives without fear of loss because they’d never experienced it.\n\n“I hate you,” she whispered, an echo of my words so many years ago to Cassava.\n\n“I know,” I said. Her eyes lifted to mine, spilling with tears and her friends drew her away, their eyes as condemning as any executioners. They helped her stand as she babbled, her words sounding as if she’d said them hundreds of times.\n\n“I saw him in the healer’s rooms, I saw him, and he smiled at me and he was fine. They stitched him up, the wound in his side wasn’t all that bad. They said he’d be fine, out in the morning. Ready to come home.” Her breath hitched and her friends cooed that it was all right. They knew all she said was true. “But they were wrong, the healers were wrong. He wasn’t all right. In the morning, he was dead, his wound open as if he’d been stabbed again, the stitches ripped, blood everywhere. Goddess, the blood!” She would have fallen if her friends hadn’t had their hands on her.\n\nI ran around, getting in front of the woman. “Wait, stop. You said he was fine. That the wound was healing?”\n\nHer eyes found mine slowly. “Yes. I held his hand, he touched my belly. Said he didn’t want to be an Ender anymore, not if he had to take orders like that again. He wanted to see our baby grow, not always fear that he would be taken from us. And he was.”"

        "content": "Smoke moved up beside me. “Lana, what do you mean take orders like that?”\n\nLana’s eyes flicked to Smoke. “That he was to kill the Enders from the Rim. He said it was wrong, but he didn’t have a choice. He was fine, just fine in the healer’s rooms. But you came back, didn’t you?” Her glare found me and held me tightly. “You came back and finished the job you started, you hateful bitch.” She launched herself at me and I again caught her, despite the lines of power racing up her arms. I didn’t want her to fall, didn’t want to hurt the child in her any more than I already had by taking its father away.\n\nCatching her around the waist as she stumbled and spun, her back pressed to my front, and my hands ended up on her belly. Spirit roared forth within me and slid through us both. I saw her baby, saw his spirit and the beat of his heart. He would follow in his father’s footsteps, be a warrior, if he survived his birth. The cord connecting him to his mother was wrapped three times around his neck.\n\n“You’re going to have a boy,” I said, holding her lightly. She relaxed in my arms, placing her hands on my mine.\n\n“How do you know—”\n\n“The birth will be easy. You won’t feel much pain, but the cord is around his neck. Three times. The midwife will know what to do.”\n\nI helped her stand on her own feet, the words flowing out my mouth. “He will be an Ender, like his father. A good man.”\n\nThe images left me, and I put a hand to my head. Lana took my wounded hand, frowning at it as if looking for an answer. “You didn’t mean to hurt him, did you?”\n\n“No, I only wanted to get out alive,” I said.\n\nShe nodded. “As do we all.” With a flick of her wrist, she dropped my hand and walked away, her friends following. But not before each of them stopped in front of me and spit at my feet.\n\nPeta, I’d almost forgotten she was on my shoulder, grunted. “That little gesture means they wouldn’t spit on you even if you were on fire.”\n\n“Nice.”\n\nBeside me, Smoke let out a long breath. “That could have been worse.”\n\n“The Enders, were they all healing that first night?” I asked and Smoke looked away.\n\n“I am forbidden to say,” she whispered.\n\n“Forbidden? Or bound?” I asked as I scooped up the overturned laundry basket. There was ash on the clothes, but I wasn’t about to stick my hands back into the river.\n\n“Both.”\n\n“So I have to figure this out myself? That’s what you’re telling me?”\n\nThe tip of Peta’s tail flicked along my neck, and I reached up to touch her, finding comfort in her presence. Smoke, though, said nothing, and I assumed that was my answer.\n\nWe headed back the way we’d come, climbing the steps into the higher parts of the cavern, the air drying my skin, hair and clothes in a matter of minutes.\n\n“Perhaps I should take you to your friend, Cactus,” Smoke said. “You can do work for him, help him clean his bachelor home.”\n\nI nodded. “Smoke, what about our ambassador here? Could he not stand for Ash in some way?”\n\nShe shook her head slowly. “The queen had all ambassadors sent home when things started to go poorly with the lava flows. She did not want to be responsible for them.”\n\nDamn, there would be no help from that quarter then.\n\nSmoke walked with me across the high arched bridge to the far side of the cavern where the singles lived. I wondered why they kept them apart from the families, and Peta must have picked up on my curiosity.\n\n“The men when not bound to a wife can be out of control with their tempers and wild ways. No one wants that near their family,” Peta said, filling me in as we walked.\n\n“How old are they when they move here?” I asked, thinking of Brand and Smoke’s son Stryker. He couldn’t be that far from an age where he was considered an adult.\n\n“Eighteen,” Smoke said.\n\n“And your son, how old is he?”\n\nHer tone trembled. “He has a year left in our home.”\n\nThere were no more words as we approached the singles section. It was remarkably quiet.\n\n“They are all kept very busy. It helps with the male aggression to keep them tired.”\n\n“I saw him, in the throne room when we were brought in.” I peered around, wondering which place belonged to Cactus.\n\nOr maybe he lived with a woman. The thought was odd. Cactus had been a player from the beginning, chasing the pretty girls and stealing kisses whenever he could. I had a hard time seeing him settling down anytime soon.\n\nSmoke stopped in front of one of the many doors. Made of a light green granite, the surface was cool even in the heat. I would have said it was beautiful, except unlike the other doors, it was . . .disgusting. Covered in patches of ash, and some sort of dark brown mud, it looked as though Cactus had never wiped it off. The rest of his home was no better, the place was like a human garbage dump, as if whoever lived there was collecting crap just for the sake of piling it in front of their house. I looked past it to the next door down the way, hoping I was wrong in my suspicion. “This is his home?”\n\nShe nodded and Peta let out a low hiss. “Disgusting man.”\n\nI couldn’t disagree with her.\n\nI took a step forward and stopped, imagining walking in on him and his latest conquest. Erring on the side of caution, I called out, “Cactus?”\n\nThere was a scuffle of feet and then he poked his head out of the doorway, saw me, and frowned. “Lark, what are you doing here?”"

        "content": "Confusion filtered through me and on its heels sharp irritation. “Well, I was brought here to be executed by your queen. So . . . yeah, I didn’t have much choice in the matter, fool.”\n\nHe shook his head, his dark red hair slicked back as if he’d come from bathing. With his green eyes, it was easy to see why the ladies flocked to him. Except for my disastrous foray into the Pit that had started this whole fiasco, I hadn’t seen him since we’d been children. I realized I really didn’t know if I could trust him. I didn’t even know if he’d helped or deliberately made it harder for us—Ash and me—to survive our last visit. I took a step back, suddenly reconsidering my decision to ask him for help.\n\nSmoke let out a soft snort. “You could at least show us some manners, boy.”\n\nHis jaw tightened. “It’s really not a good time.”\n\nI knew it. “Too many women in there? It’s not like I’m going to be shocked, Cactus.”\n\nHis mouth tightened farther and I wondered at how I’d possibly upset him. He’d bragged as a kid that he’d have all the ladies fawning over him one day. So now he had what he wanted, what was the issue?\n\nBeside me Smoke snapped her fingers. “Cactus, this is ridiculous. Invite us in. You do not want to have this conversation outside.”\n\nHe swiped a hand over his face, clearing away the irritation, replacing it with a false smile that almost trembled. “Would you like to come in?”\n\nI no longer did, but I had to find a way to get Ash out alive and that meant I needed all the help I could get. Even if Cactus wasn’t the man I thought he should be.\n\nStepping through the doorway, I didn’t know what to expect. Filthy, dirty clothes everywhere, food piled up and rotting. My imagination did not prepare me in the least.\n\nI had to blink several times to really grasp what I was seeing. His house was an explosion of greenery and flowers, smells that took me back to the Rim. From the ceiling, plants and flowers curled down, covering every inch of exposed rock. The walls were blanketed in ivy and blackberry vines heavy with perfect black fruit. Under our feet the moss was so thick I could believe there was no stone beneath us. Down the wall, a trickle of water ran, feeding the plants and tiny flowers, the sound a perfect, soothing echo in the small space. Was this why he didn’t want us to come in?\n\nI closed my eyes and breathed in. “Cactus, this is amazing.”\n\n“You like it?”\n\nI opened my eyes to see him watching me, his look carefully guarded. “Like it? It’s just like home.”\n\nA slow breath escaped him. I glanced at Smoke to see her eyes wide. “How did you manage to get all this to grow?”\n\n“Oh, I still carry a little of my connection to the earth,” Cactus said softly, his hands brushing against a fern at his side. It leaned toward him and in that moment I knew something was terribly wrong. He shouldn’t have been able to use so much of the earth’s power. That was why his mother sent him to the Pit so many years ago; he had no power in the earth. That was the major drawback to being a half-breed. They were often weak not just in one of their bloodlines, but both. That Cactus had shown any strength at all was a miracle.\n\nYet if that rule held true, how could this be? How could he draw on both his bloodlines? Or maybe he was like me, an anomaly with that ability.\n\n“Cactus.” Just his name and his eyes lifted to mine. What I saw made my mouth dry. He was terrified. “Smoke, would you leave us please?” I never took my eyes from his.\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\n“Peta and Cactus can look out for me.” I spit out the words fast, knowing the longer Smoke was there, the more fear built in Cactus. Smoke touched my arm and I forced myself to turn from Cactus to meet her eyes. I put a hand over hers. “Thank you.”\n\nHer eyes were tight around the edges. “Lark. You may not have an execution over your head but there are those who would still see you dead. An accident can happen all too easily as you have already seen.”\n\n“I will heed your words.” I squeezed her hand and she stepped back, pausing in the doorway, her eyes flicking over the greenery.\n\n“You are right to hide this, Cactus. The queen . . . she is strange about other powers in her home. But your secret will be safe with me, you are not the only one who hides.” She placed a hand over her heart and then kissed her fingertips. A slight breeze lifted her hair and swirled from her hands, out and around the ferns. Another half-breed, like us. Without another word, Smoke stepped out of Cactus’s house.\n\nPeta leapt from my shoulders onto the mossy ground. “Dirt Girl, is your home like this?”\n\n“Parts of it.”\n\n“I could handle being your familiar if this is what my paws get to be on.” She lifted her feet up and down in exaggerated steps several times.\n\nSmiling, I turned back to Cactus. He took three strides and wrapped an arm around my waist. “I’ve waited all my life for this, Lark.”\n\nHe dropped his head and pressed his lips against mine.\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nHis hands slid up my waist to my back, tugging me closer. All my childhood feelings for him that I’d thought were gone and dead, blossomed under his touch. I could almost feel him laughing as he kissed me, his lips and tongue teasing my mouth. Making me want to laugh with him despite the fact that I was in the Pit, Ash’s life hung in the balance, and someone tried to boil me.\n\nThat was Cactus, his love of life was infectious, but sometimes it got in the way.\n\nI put my hands on his shoulders and turned my face. “Cactus, don’t. Please.”"

        "content": "“You aren’t with Coal anymore. I heard that through the grapevine.” He reached out and touched a hanging bunch of grapes to the right of us, a smile on his lips. I laughed softly.\n\n“Stop. You’re right I’m not with Coal . . .”\n\nHe raised an eyebrow but didn’t let go of me with his other hand. “But?”\n\nI didn’t know what to say or how to explain Ash, because even I didn’t really know what was going on there. “I’m just not . . .I have to focus on getting Ash and me out of here. And I need your help.”\n\nHis eye green eyes lowered then slowly rose to mine. “And we can have this conversation after?”\n\nI couldn’t help the laugh with those puppy dog eyes he was laying on me. “Fine. We’ll have this conversation after.”\n\nHe let go of me and glanced to the floor. “What are you doing with the bad luck cat?”\n\nPeta let out a low growl. “I’m her familiar, prick.”\n\nHis eyebrows shot straight up. “Truly?”\n\n“Yes. Listen. I need you to focus. Can you do that?” I asked, hoping I could get him to be serious for at least a few minutes.\n\n“For you, Larkspur, princess of the Rim, of course.”\n\n“Princess?” Peta spit out the word with enough shock to make me blush.\n\n“”Bastard child,” I said.\n\nCactus grunted. “The only bastards in the Rim were your siblings and Cassava.”\n\nTaking me by the hand he drew me deeper into the house. The greenery he’d been growing wasn’t any thinner the farther back we went. If anything, the walls were thicker with the growth. “Cactus, how are you hiding this?”\n\nHe stopped in front of another door and slowly pushed it open. “I have to get out of here too, Lark. Whatever you’re planning, I’m in. Because if I don’t escape soon . . . Smoke is right. Fiametta is a hard ass and the fact I can do this much with the earth will either make her want to kill me or use me more than she already is.”\n\nI followed him into what I belatedly realized was his bedroom. “Cactus, I said we’d discuss our relationship later, but I didn’t mean a few minutes later.”\n\nHe held up his hands, finally letting go of me. “It’s safer back here. Less chance of someone listening in.”\n\nPeta trotted forward, the white tip in her tail twitching several times as she sniffed the room. “He’s right. The green stuff blocks the echo of voices the queen’s spies could listen to through the rock.”\n\nToo much information at the same time made my head hurt. “Echo through the rock?”\n\nCactus flopped onto his bed, the woven vines and thick moss giving under his weight. He tucked his hands behind his head, his lean muscular body a rather inviting picture. He gave me a wink as if the fool knew what I was thinking. I fought the heat that rose in my cheeks. He spoke as though he hadn’t noticed though. “Echo in the rock. The queen has Listeners who use the residual fire molecules within the rock to spy on her people. The plants muffle our voices.”\n\nI sank to sit on the bed beside him. Peta jumped into my lap and I put a hand on her, finding once more a comfort in her presence I hadn’t expected. She looked to my face. “Dirt Girl, you can’t save them all from their own queen. If you want to get your fellow Ender out, then that’s what we need to focus on. What Brand asks of you could work in your favor.”\n\nScratching one finger under her chin, I watched as her eyes closed and a low purr rumbled out of her. Her eyes popped open and she glared at me. “No amount of chin scratches will change what I suggest.”\n\nCactus sat up. “If you need to get Ash out, then we need to play by the rules. Fiametta is a stickler for them. Which is why I hide this.” He waved his hand as if to encompass the room. “She has stated that half breeds can only exist here if they don’t touch their other half without her permission. Which isn’t an issue for most since there are very few who can actually do anything.” He ran a hand through his slicked back hair.\n\n“But when did you find you could reach so much of the earth?” I found myself dropping my voice. Knowing Fiametta could be listening in was downright creepy.\n\n“When I hit puberty. It was like something inside me opened and suddenly I could make things grow. And as you can imagine, a talent like that is valuable here.”\n\n“So Fiametta probably wouldn’t banish you.” I frowned, running the possibilities through my head. “But she’d force you to work for her, like a Planter?”\n\n“Worse,” Peta said softly. “She’d tell everyone he’d died and then keep him for herself, deep within her palace.”\n\nI stared down at Peta. “You know that for sure?”\n\nShe nodded. “You remember Loam? That was why he was in the Deep, to find weak Undines he could bring back with him for Fiametta. They draw the water up through the earth, bringing us the clean water we need. Same with the Sylphs, they funnel the fresh air and oxygen that the mountain and lava devour.”\n\n“Mother goddess,” I breathed out, the enormity of what Peta and Cactus were telling me overshadowing the fact I had to find a way to get us out of the Pit. Fiametta was using slaves? The Undines used human slaves, but that was . . . different. Maybe it wasn’t. I squeezed my eyes shut. Slavery was forbidden amongst all four elemental families. How in the seven hells was Fiametta getting away with this?\n\n“They aren’t slaves,” Peta said. “They sign a contract stating they will be cared for if they do as they’re asked. If they don’t then they will be killed.”"

        "content": "Cactus choked and his eyes widened. “That is just slavery with a contract.”\n\nPeta nodded. “Still, it is a loophole the rulers here have used for years. They all do it, just to different degrees.”\n\n“That’s not true in the Rim,” I said. “There is no slavery there.”\n\nTwo sets of green eyes turned my way and I didn’t like what I saw in them. Pity and disbelief.\n\nMy jaw tightened. “There is no slavery in the Rim, but I’m not going to argue about that right now. We have far more pressing matters.”\n\nThe urgency of my task suddenly seemed overwhelming. I had to get us out of the Pit before anything could be done about the slavery Fiametta was enforcing.\n\nAll four of us had to be free of the Pit and the inherent dangers within it.\n\n“Peta,” I scooped her up so I could lift her to my eye level. “Are you really with me? Can I trust you with my life?”\n\nHer cat lips dipped in a perfect frown. “The mother goddess assigned me to you herself. It is my job to help you stay alive.”\n\n“That’s not what I’m asking.” I stared into those green eyes as the idea that had formed within my mind grew. Peta knew the Pit, probably better than Cactus, and she was all but ignored because of her status. Which made her the perfect spy. But so much of my plan depended on being able to trust my familiar. “Peta, are you with me?”\n\nShe blinked several times before she answered. “You’re going to be the death of all nine of my lives, aren’t you?”\n\n“I hope not.”\n\nShe snorted and her ears twitched. “I am with you, Dirt Girl. What are you going to ask of me?”\n\n“Can you get into the Ender Barracks? There is an Ender with a scar on the top of his right hand. I need to know his name.”\n\nShe squirmed out of my hands. “What does the scar look like?”\n\nI squatted beside her, and turned my hand palm down. The scars on my hand from Peta grabbing me had faded to silvery lines. While they were not ridged like the ones the Ender sported, but they were similar enough. “Like my scars only thicker, like a bigger cat maybe clawed him.”\n\nPeta looked at me, her eyes narrowed to mere slits making it impossible to read her. “He should be easy to find. Why do you want him?”\n\n“He’s a traitor to the queen. If we give him to her, I think we should be able to bargain for Ash’s life,” I said. Cactus gave a low grunt.\n\n“You do not know her very well then.”\n\nI looked at Peta. “And what do you think, cat? You think the queen will not bargain?” It wasn’t my only option, but I needed a way to buy Ash time. Time I needed to find a permanent way out.\n\n“Cactus is right. She won’t bargain.” Peta shook her head, her ears twitching. “But it might buy us time if you offer her a traitor on a platter. She likes nothing more than to wield the Lava Whip herself on those she deems deserving of punishment.”\n\nI didn’t want to ask what the Lava Whip was. I could easily guess. A shiver ran down my spine. “Time is better than nothing. See if you can find the Ender I described to you. But be careful.”\n\nPeta bobbed her head and ran down the hallway, her tiny footsteps eaten by the moss. I bit my lower lip and closed my eyes. “Cactus, we may all end up in the fire if this goes wrong.”\n\nHe stood, moving to my side and draping an arm across my shoulders. “We all end up in the fire at some point, Lark. But if anyone can get us there sooner, it’s you.” At my incredulous expression, Cactus fell back onto the mossy mattress. “I’m kidding, Lark.”\n\nI plopped onto the springy edge. He sat down beside me and brushed a hand over my hair, so gently I barely felt his touch; it was more a sense of knowing him, and his intentions. “You’ve always been special, Lark. When I heard about Cassava’s trickery . . . and how you faced her down with nothing but a spear; that you saved your entire family, I wasn’t surprised. After that some of my memories came back.” The last was said in a near whisper.\n\nI swallowed hard. “You remember the day in the meadow?”\n\nThe day my mother and brother were killed.\n\nHe nodded, dropping his head to press it against mine. “I think maybe Cassava blocked some of my abilities too, keeping me weak. The longer I was away from her, the longer I was here in the Pit, the stronger I got.”\n\nA shudder danced along my spine and I let myself relax against him. “I’m sorry she hurt you too.”\n\nHis hand rubbed along my back. “Meh. I’m tough for a fool.”\n\nLaughing, I turned to face him, but the laughter died quickly. “Smoke said something that might save Ash faster than finding a traitor. Something that Lana confirmed whether she meant to or not.”\n\nCactus leaned back on his elbows, his eyes thoughtful. “If anyone has an inkling of a rumor, it’ll be Smoke. People don’t see her. They treat her poorly because she’s a half breed.” He jerked upright. “Wait, you saw Lana?”\n\n“She was at the water. It was not a good scene.”\n\nI leaned back beside him and we lay down at the same time, staring up at the ceiling and the wisteria that hung like pale purple bunches of grapes, the scent of the flowers flowing around us. “Smoke said something about the Enders who were killed. That maybe it wasn’t the injuries we—I—inflicted but something else. And Lana confirmed it. She said she saw her husband that night. He was fine and healing, and the next morning he was dead. His wounds opened and left to die.”"

        "content": "Turning my head to the side I stared at his profile, but he didn’t turn to me. He kept looking at the ceiling. “The question is, who would want to hurt them?”\n\nThat was the question I was asking myself. “I don’t know. Does Fiametta have anyone vying for her throne?” I was thinking of my trip to the Deep and the battle for the crown that had nearly taken my, Belladonna’s, and Ash’s lives. I was really hoping that wasn’t the case again. Two powerful battling fire elementals was not something I wanted to get in the middle of.\n\n“No. Everyone is terrified of her. She’s a hard ass, in the truest sense of the words, Lark. There is no room for softness in her. If you’re useful, you’re good in her eyes. If you aren’t, she has no room for you.” He draped an arm over his forehead.\n\n“And what is your use for her?” I reached up and touched his fingers. I wanted him to look at me. His voice wasn’t giving me any indication as to how he was feeling.\n\nCactus learned to hide as well as I had as a child in the forest. “Cactus, what are you afraid of? Because if it was just a matter of the queen, you’d leave.”\n\nHe was silent for a good minute before he answered, his voice carefully neutral.\n\n“Because of my connection to the earth, I can do more damage than most Salamanders. Within the fire are particles of rock and granite so my blows are a double hit if I’m defending our people against the firewyrms who lurk below us.” He finally turned to me. His green eyes held more than a measure of pain. “I’m not an Ender, Lark. Not like you. I’m just a tool used at her discretion. I’m the threat behind her words and that is why escaping her is going to be so hard.”\n\nI reached out and smoothed the lines between his brows. There were no words I could say, nothing to make it better. But my heart ached at the thought of losing not only Ash, but Cactus too. No, I couldn’t let that happen.\n\nI wished I knew exactly how I was going to stop both men from being lost to Fiametta.\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nLaying on Cactus’s bed, I closed my eyes and breathed in the green scents, letting them soothe my mind and body, the strength of them flowing through my bruised and battered arm and hand. Somewhere in that spot between wakefulness and sleep, I floated, recharging all I was. Cactus curled his body around me and I held onto him like I’d done more than once as a child. We had to wait on Peta anyway, so the guilt I felt at lying quietly and resting while Ash lay in a dungeon, eased.\n\nAs children, Cactus and I had clung to each other in the dark of the night as we shared stories of monsters creeping out of the Deep or the Pit, of winged beasts flying from the Eyrie to steal bad Terralings away. Now, those stories seemed more possible than ever and it was in that moment the image flickered through my mind of the massive doors leading to the throne room and the dragon carved into it. No wings, a sinuous body, and all the gemstones around it, the malice just the image gave off.\n\nFirewyrms were the stuff of legend, even in the Rim, yet even as I thought of the creature, I dismissed it. There was no way firewyrms were here. Not a chance. Cactus had to be joking as he so often had when we were children.\n\nThe soft give of the bed under weight brought me around and I slowly opened my eyes. Peta’s green eyes stared into mine. “The Ender you’re looking for is nowhere to be found, Dirt Girl.” She pushed herself under my jaw, curling into the space between my chest and chin, her head resting in the crook of my neck. “Perhaps he is one of the Enders you killed.”\n\nI reached up and touched her back, the calming energy on either side of me allowing me to think clearly. “No, he was part of the group that brought me and Ash in. I wouldn’t have seen his memories otherwise, so he has to be here somewhere.”\n\nWhat would I do if I couldn’t find the traitor to hand to Fiametta to in turn buy Ash time? The only other person I could ask was Brand, but despite the fact he was Ash’s friend, I wasn’t sure how much he could do bound to Fiametta. Only one way to find out, and that would be to ask him who was with the posse to get us from the Rim.\n\nHolding Peta to me, I sat up and then stood. “Cactus, I have to go.”\n\n“I’m coming with you.” He scrubbed a hand through his hair making it stick up in a riotous mess. “I couldn’t help you much the last time you were here. The queen was watching me closely.”\n\n“Why?” Peta asked before I could spit it out.\n\nHe gave us a lopsided grin. “I turned down her invitation to her bedroom.”\n\nPeta made a sound that was a mix between a hiss and a snort that I thought might have been a gasp. Spluttering, she managed to spit out, “How are you still alive?”\n\nCactus shrugged, but his lips twitched. “I told her my heart was broken by someone from the Rim, and I’d sworn celibacy to the mother goddess.”\n\nI lowered Peta to the floor where she glared at Cactus, her thoughts all but written on her face. She didn’t believe him.\n\nMy turn. “And she believed you?”\n\n“I told her the princess I loved still held my heart and I could never be unfaithful to her, even if I could never be with her.” Cactus’s tone was light and teasing but in the depths of his eyes I saw the yearning. The truth behind his words. I was the one he wanted. I was the princess sworn to another.\n\nI looked away. “Peta, why would Fiametta buy that?”\n\n“I’m surprised she did,” Peta said. “But that doesn’t mean it can’t happen. The queen keeps things close to her chest and lets no one in. Not even her children.”"

        "content": "I walked out of the room and down the hall. “You can come, Cactus. But if for one instant Fiametta starts to pay attention to you—”\n\n“I’ll back out. Don’t worry so much, Lark. This will be slick as slug spit.” He jogged to catch up to me, swatting me lightly on the ass with an open palm. I arched an eyebrow at him.\n\n“Cactus.” Just his name, a simple warning. Peta was less subtle.\n\n“Keep your hands to yourself, prick.”\n\nThe three of us stepped out of Cactus’s place and into the open cavern and just for a moment, disorientation flowed over me. Going from the green, cool, and flowering place that Cactus had created to the stark rock of the inner mountain I had to take a few breaths and get my bearings. The heat picked up with each step we took, like being inside a tiny box, we couldn’t escape the closed in air and for just a moment panic reared its head.\n\nI wanted to run, to get to Brand as quick as possible and ask him who was with us when we’d Traveled; just to get this over with. But if Cactus was right and the queen had her spies watching everyone, listening to everything, I had to be careful.\n\nWalking swiftly, I headed back to the bridge. I stepped onto the arched structure and bolted across. The heat from the lava flowed through the rock that made up the bridge despite how thick each piece of stone was.\n\nPeta trotted across, her tail flicking in the air and Cactus sauntered, smiling at me the whole way. I shook my head and spun, stepping right into the chest of a well-endowed woman. Bouncing off her, I took a couple steps back. “I’m sorry.”\n\nShe was almost as tall as my six feet, which was unusual. Her hair was so dark a red, it was almost a purple tone, and her eyes were a pale gray. Other than her large chest, it was difficult to tell she was a woman. Her shoulders were incredibly broad and her hips narrow but between hips and shoulders she had a monstrous gut.\n\nShe arched an eyebrow at me. “Terraling. What are you doing wandering around?”\n\nPeta strode between us, shifting into her full leopard form, her black spotted thick white coat rippling. “I’m watching over her, Fay. Leave the Dirt Girl to me.”\n\nFay let out a low laugh. “Oh, then she’ll be dead within the week. Well done, bad luck cat.” She patted Peta’s head and strolled away, still laughing. I took a step forward and touched Peta’s head.\n\n“Don’t listen to them,” I said, knowing what it was to be the one your people looked down on.\n\nPeta let out a low growl. “We are not friends, Dirt Girl. Not by a long shot. I do this because I must.” She shrunk back to her housecat form and stiff legged, stalked away from me.\n\nCactus was at my side a second later. “She’s . . .touchy. In all the four families, Peta has lost the most charges. They always die on her, and the mother goddess doesn’t seem inclined to stop handing her off to people.”\n\n“Lovely. And now everyone will think I’m next on the list.”\n\n“Why do you think Peta hasn’t told anyone she’s your familiar unless she has to?” Cactus arched an eyebrow at me and I realized he had a point. As long as Peta kept quiet, no one would make the connection between us and when I died, it would be one less death on her.\n\nDamn, that was a tough row to hoe.\n\n“I hate to disappoint her, but I don’t plan on dying anytime soon,” I muttered as I walked after my familiar. My familiar. That had a nice ring to it, even if Peta hated me. Maybe I could get a new familiar once this was all over. One that could tolerate me and would be nice.\n\nPeta waited quietly outside Smoke and Brand’s house. She sat and stared past me, her green eyes unblinking, and she said nothing. Fine by me.\n\nI put a hand to the edge of the door and peered in. “Smoke?”\n\nNot Smoke but their youngest boy, Tinder answered me. “Hi, Terraling. My mom isn’t here right now.” He grinned up me, two front teeth missing on the top of his jaw. I smiled back.\n\n“Actually, I was wondering if you knew where your dad was?”\n\nHe bobbed his head several times and for just a moment I saw Cactus as he’d been as a child. Always eager to be a part of whatever was going on. “Yup. He’s down by the edge of the Pit. But I think that’s too hot for you. You’ll burn up.”\n\nI forced myself to smile, because he was right. I had no protection from the heat and flames. “Thanks, I’ll be careful.”\n\n“I could take you there. I was just swimming there with my brothers.” He slapped a hand over his mouth and I remembered Smoke told him specifically not to swim at the Pit. I shook my head. “It’s okay. I’ve got Cactus here to take me.”\n\nCactus gave the boy a wink. “Besides, you wouldn’t want your dad seeing you find your way to the Pit on your own when you aren’t supposed to even know where it is, right?”\n\nTinder nodded, his eyes solemn. “You’re right.” He spun and ran back into the house before I could say goodbye.\n\nBeside me, Cactus chuckled. “They all find their way to the Pit before they’re supposed to.”\n\nI glanced at Peta. “You coming?”\n\nShe flicked an ear at me, stretched and sauntered out in front of us. I lifted an eyebrow at Cactus. “You still want to come with me? I’m sure Peta can take me there with no problem.”\n\nHis green eyes sparkled. “You’re going to need me, Lark. I just know it. So yes, I’m coming with you.”\n\nI wasn’t arguing with him. He had gained strength in his abilities in our years apart and now was the queen’s threat against whatever they were afraid of. Not a bad guy to have on my team while I attempted the impossible. We walked the length of the cavern, and at the far end, a cut in the rock opened. Stairs led downward, and the same light reflecting in tunnels that I’d seen in Cactus’s home and the main cavern were used to illuminate the darkness."

        "content": "“How far down?” I put my foot on the first step, the rock warm under my bare feet.\n\n“Long,” Peta said. “It will take at least half an hour to get to the bottom.”\n\nDamn, that was a long ways down. But if I hurried, I was sure I could cut the time in half. Jogging down the stairs, I easily kept pace with Peta who was running ahead, the white tip of her tail twitching side to side as she leapt down each stair.\n\n“Lark, slow down.” Cactus caught up to me and touched my arm. I glanced at him.\n\n“What are you talking about?”\n\n“You’re running as if you’re in a hurry,” he said, his own pace slowing, his hand dragging at me.\n\nFrowning, I didn’t slow. “We are in a hurry. Ash’s life is on the line and I was just lying on my back in your room as if there was nothing in the world to—”\n\n“Easy, easy. I know. But you had to heal and that was as good a place as any to let your body pull together while we waited for Peta. The thing is . . . if you look like you’re in a hurry, people are going to notice you more. You don’t want that, Lark. You don’t want to be noticed here.” He stared straight ahead, his thumbs hooked into his belt as he walked slowly.\n\nPainstakingly slow. Peta turned her head and let out a sneeze. “He’s right.”\n\nDamn it, I just wanted to get to Brand before the day was over. That was the other part of being in the Pit that weighed on me. How many hours had gone by? How would I know when I had only a day left? The lack of sun was fouling my ability to gauge time.\n\nAnd I said as much to Cactus, but Peta answered.\n\n“Everyone goes to sleep when night falls; that is how you know the day is over. And when you wake, the new day has started.” She slowed and I bent to pick her up, only touching her when she gave me a bob of her head.\n\nPlacing her on my shoulder, I kept walking, forcing my feet to go slow even as they itched to run. “That seems . . . odd.”\n\n“It’s how the Pit has been run for as long as I can remember.” Peta wrapped her tail around my neck as she perched on my left shoulder like some sort of oversized bird that was currently purring. I chose not to point out she was obviously enjoying my company; the connection between us was growing in leaps and bounds.\n\nIn the back of my head I sensed her emotions and general thoughts. Nothing specific, but more of an overview of where she was in her feelings and mindset. Already I could tell she was secretly pleased I had listened to her, and while she was far from happy that I was her new charge, she didn’t really hate me.\n\nI forced my thoughts back to the whole sleeping business. “So what makes everyone fall asleep? Or is there like a gong that sounds and everyone just goes to bed?”\n\nCactus shook his head. “No gong, a bell. First the bell chimes, then you get a warning that sleep is coming from a tingling in the spine that spreads through your body. Enough time to get to a bed and lie down.”\n\n“And if you don’t?”\n\nHe answered, “You fall asleep wherever you are. Sometimes people get caught in the tunnels and sleep the night on the hard stone.”\n\nThe bottom of the stairs flattened out into a large chunk of quartz smoothed and polished to a high sheen under our feet. The rock protruded out into open space all the way around the edge of the cavern we were in. A platform if I ever saw one. Cactus pointed past me toward the flickering sparks of fire that rose up from below. “This is the Pit. You sure you want to go in?”\n\n“No choice,” I said. And there wasn’t, not if I wanted to save Ash.\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nThe platform was warm under my feet as I stepped onto it, my toes curling against the stone. Heat waves rolled up in rippling shadows that filled the air. I couldn’t see the lava, but I heard it burping and plopping as it boiled far below. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to step farther onto the platform. The smooth rock ran a good twenty feet deep all the way around the edge of the Pit and it reminded me all too strongly of the Deep and their mini coliseum. Was this a platform to watch people fight to the death within the lava? Mother goddess I hoped not.\n\nAt various and seemingly random points along the edge of the platform, stairs curled downward to the main floor where a few Salamanders walked. One was swimming in the lava. My brain still struggled to comprehend how that was possible.\n\nI took another step and a tiny set of claws dug into my right shoulder.\n\n“Lark, do not walk to the edge. Go to your belly. If you get a waft of fumes, you could pass out and fall in,” Peta said.\n\nWorm shit, I hadn’t thought about that. I nodded and dropped to my knees, slid down to my belly, and then scooted forward. Cactus did the same, inching up beside me. I peered over the edge of the rock, and Peta scooted across my spine to sit on the back of my shoulders. But that was a distant sensory to what I saw.\n\nLava indeed. The Pit was one monstrous magma pool that stretched several hundred feet across with tendrils reaching out; rivers that spread through the mountain. Orange and reds, yellows and golds so intense that my eyes hurt looking at the pool. Waves of heat wafted off the surface, curling into the air, bringing the smell of burnt things and sulfur.\n\n“Hypnotizing.” I scooted a little farther forward to get a better look and Peta’s claws tipped into me again.\n\n“No swimming,” she said.\n\nI shook my head, but Cactus still grabbed my hand, his fingers lacing tightly with mine.\n\n“Just in case.” He winked at me, a grin tugging at his lips.\n\nLeaning over the edge, I gripped his hand. Something was pulling me, urging me to get closer. The soft whisper of words barely spoken, teased my ears. Someone was close below us and something about the voices made me think it would be worth listening in on."

        "content": "I looked at Cactus and pointed at my feet. I barely breathed the words, “Hold my ankles.”\n\n“Lark don’t—”\n\nBut I didn’t give him a choice. I wriggled over the edge, forcing him to grab me.\n\nHe shimmied back and grabbed my ankles even as he grumbled, helping me slide over the edge. Peta said nothing, but clung to my back, digging her claws into my leather vest like a burr tangled in my hair.\n\nEven those few inches closer to the lava, the increased heat made sweat pop out over my body in a vain attempt to cool my temperature. The heat dried the sweat as fast as it slid down my sides.\n\nGripping the granite cliff, I dug my fingers into the rock, imagining it softening enough to get a better hold. The rock gave under my hands and I stared at the granite, swallowing my surprise. I quickly shaped the rock into perfect handholds. Peta grunted, her voice in my ear, a bare whisper. “We need to discuss this later. You shouldn’t be able to mold rock like that.”\n\nAs interesting as that little tidbit was, I had more pressing things on my mind.\n\nUsing my handholds and trusting Cactus, I slid a few more inches until I could see underneath the platform toward the whispering I was sure I heard.\n\nThe shadowed overhang made it hard to make out what was going on.\n\nA tiny flash of movement, the soft muttering of words I felt I should understand; a language I’d heard maybe when I was a child. Narrowing my eyes, I shifted another inch and then went still. My hair swept out around my head, dangling a good foot lower. Whoever was down there was bound to see it. I should have tied it up but it was too late now.\n\nPale white scales flickered up at me, and two pairs of eyes the color of amethyst blinked several times. The firewyrms were small, maybe the length of my legs at most and curled around each other. They looked like wingless, sinewy dragons. Their mouths had row upon row of needle sharp teeth I had no doubt would rip through armor, rock, and maybe even hardened steel.\n\nThe one in front had a scar down its left side, the scales missing in a long, jagged line. Scar stepped closer to me and let out a long, low hiss that ended in a gurgle.\n\n“Cactus,” I said, keeping my voice as even and smooth as possible. “Tell me about firewyrms.”\n\n“Oh shit, those bastards are causing problems. Nesting where they shouldn’t and then attacking when people—wait, why would you ask me that now?” His hands tightened on my ankles and he started to pull me up but I grabbed onto the rock. Scar’s eyes, they held a world of hurt and fear. A child lost.\n\nI couldn’t help myself.\n\nJerking my feet out of Cactus’s hands, I swung my legs over and into the shallow notched space. Peta let out a squawk and her tiny body tightened as we landed in a crouch. The firewyrms scuttled backward, mouths open as they threatened, but no fire erupted, no flames came our way.\n\nPeta bit my ear, her sharp teeth piercing the cartilage. “You idiot, I said I didn’t want you to die, and you drop into a wyrm nest? What’s wrong with you?”\n\nHeart pounding, I didn’t move, didn’t even stand. “Hey, you two, I heard you talking.” On my shoulder, Peta went still. “You shouldn’t be able to understand them, Dirt Girl.”\n\nI held a hand out to them. “Who hurt you?”\n\nScar looked over his shoulder, quickly to his sibling then stretched his neck forward. He squinted one eye as a long forked tongue flicked toward me. His scales were more than white, they were opalescent with rainbow colors dancing on them, as they caught a bit of light. With each step he took toward me, his clawed feet clacked on the stone.\n\nHis headgear was six long antelope-like antlers that arched back over his neck away from his long muzzle. The same pale white horns spiked from his elbows and the bend in his hind legs. With a whip-like tail that was barbed at the end, I had no doubt he could lash out for a distance. Topping it off were his claws. Five on each foot, and at least twelve inches long, they seemed oversized for his body.\n\nYet fear still didn’t touch me.\n\nMy heart pounded and the blood roared in my ears, like an oncoming storm that would be amazing. Or terrifying. Or both.\n\nThat long tongue flicked over my fingers and then he scuttled backward, his lips curling upward. Peta clung to me, breathing so hard she panted in my ear. “Dirt Girl, we need to go. He will fry us both.”\n\nI put a hand on her in an attempt to ease her trembling. “Scar, what happened to you?”\n\nHe rolled his head so he looked at me upside down. “Vy do you care?”\n\nHis voice was pitched low enough that I knew now why I’d struggled to understand. He had an accent.\n\n“I don’t like any of the mother goddess’s creatures to suffer,” I said, holding my hand out to him again. A show of trust, and faith that he wouldn’t fry us, as Peta said.\n\nPeta meowed and buried her head against my neck, her whole body shaking. Scar slid forward and pressed his nose against the palm of my hand.\n\nA quiet sigh slipped out of him. “You smell nice.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\nHis eyes flicked to his sibling and then back to me. “Vy are you being nice to us?”\n\nI stayed crouched so I was at eye level with him. “I’m hoping you can tell me about your people.”\n\nHis head wove back and forth several times. “My people are dying out. The fire queen hunts and kills us. Ve don’t mean to attack, but ve can’t help it. The pink light fills our minds and ve must obey.”\n\nHis words couldn’t have shocked me more. “Pink light?” As in the light I saw when elementals were controlled by Spirit. Was that what was happening?"

        "content": "Behind me was a thump of feet hitting the ground and Scar scuttled backward, hissing and snarling. “Hunter!”\n\nI glanced over my shoulder, thinking I would see Cactus. But it was someone I didn’t recognize. An Ender in black leathers and gloves was all I registered before he grabbed me and jerked me behind him. “Get back, idiot, you don’t know what they are capable of.”\n\nI hit the ground, stumbling under the force of his throw, sliding to the edge unable to stop my momentum. I scrabbled at the rock, crying out as my body slipped into open space. Peta screeched, as the world turned upside down as I rolled in the air.\n\nA flash of white scales and the world righted itself, or at least, stopped moving. I hung upside down and Peta clung to the front of my vest, her tail bristled out like a cotton puff.\n\n“Peta, who grabbed us?”\n\n“Your new friend,” she whispered.\n\nI managed to lean up and look past her. Scar clung to the cliff face, holding onto my leg with his long tail, the barb hooking over his own flesh to lock around my limb. His claws were buried into the stone and he slowly began to climb sideways.\n\nAbove us in the tiny cave came shouting and the sound of flesh being hit. “Hurry, Scar. Get me back up there.”\n\nHe shook his head. “We can’t save her. The Hunter will take her.”\n\nThe mother goddess’s words suddenly made sense. Lives to save . . . she didn’t send me to save Ash.\n\nShe sent me to save the firewyrms.\n\n“Scar, get me up there. Now!” Anger coursed through my veins; an anger born of understanding. To be treated as though you were worthless and should be wiped out . . . that I knew too well. I reached to the earth as Scar climbed swiftly up the rock, the power humming under my skin, filling me with its strength. A flick of his tail and I launched into the air and over the edge.\n\nThe other firewyrm lay unmoving, the Ender standing over her. He had one foot on her tail and his club dripped with blood.\n\n“Get away from her.” I whipped my hand out, calling the earth upward and throwing the Ender backward. He slammed into the far wall, his head snapping hard against the rock. Eyes rolled back, he slid to the ground in a slump.\n\nI ran forward and dropped to my knees in front of the firewyrm. “Scar, does she have a name?”\n\n“No, ve don’t have names. Ve just are. You are the first to name one of us in a long time.” His head pushed under my arm as I laid my hands on the white, still scales. No breath and her heartbeat was gone.\n\nPeta let out a sigh. “Spirit can heal, Dirt Girl. I don’t know how, but I know it can. If it isn’t too late.”\n\nI didn’t hesitate; if I were to lose a piece of my soul for saving another, then so be it.\n\nGrappling with the other side of my bloodline, I brought Spirit forward. Like an unruly horse, it bucked and pulled from me, making me sweat as I tried to direct it. Why now? Before when I’d called on it, there had been no fight. But I’d not tried to heal anyone before, so maybe that was it.\n\nI tried to be gentle as I pushed Spirit into the firewyrm, directing it to flow through her muscles, into her heart, across her bones. Sweat dripping from my face, I gritted my teeth as I tried to bring her back.\n\nPeta licked my cheek. “You can’t save her, Dirt Girl. She’s gone too long. That is why Spirit fights you, I believe. I think she was already beyond your reach.”\n\nI let go of Spirit and hung my head, tears dripping along with the sweat. “Then what is the point of being able to have Spirit if I can do nothing with it?”\n\nScar stuck his head onto my lap. “You tried. That is more than any others have done.”\n\nWrapping my arm around his neck, I hugged him tightly to me before letting him go. “You’d better get out of here, the Ender will wake soon. Take your sister with you.” I stood and Scar scuttled forward, scooping his sister onto his back.\n\n“Be careful,” he said, then disappeared over the side of the ledge once more. I followed, watching him slither down the vertical wall as if it were nothing to him. Glancing up, I realized that Cactus had been suspiciously absent.\n\n“Cactus?”\n\nNothing.\n\nI reached up and grabbed the handholds I’d made on my way down and pulled myself up. Peta leapt from my shoulders onto the top of the ledge.\n\n“He’s here, but . . . you aren’t going to like this,” she said. The tone in her voice made me scramble faster. I swung my legs up and over, scooting forward on my belly for a few feet before pushing to my knees.\n\nCactus was flat on his back, a large goose egg budding over his left eye. I ran one finger over it and brought Spirit forward again. It didn’t fight me as I wove its strength through Cactus’s body. I didn’t really know what I was doing, letting Spirit do as it would.\n\nThe bump shrank until there was nothing, not even a bruise on his skin. He blinked and sat up. “What the hell just happened? I was calling to you and then something slammed into my head and nothing until right now.”\n\nI gave him a weak grin. “What do you get when you find a firewyrm, fight an Ender, and fall off a cliff?”\n\n“Shit.” He stood and pulled me to my feet. “Where is the Ender?”\n\n“Still in the cave down there.”\n\n“Tell me you didn’t kill him,” Cactus said, reaching for me. I frowned at him.\n\n“I’m not an idiot. I just knocked him out.”\n\nPeta gave a full body shiver. “We must hide the fact that you attacked him, Dirt Girl. With Cactus’s injury gone, we will all say we have no idea what that Ender is talking about when he accuses you. Do you understand?”"

        "content": "I nodded, but I wasn’t sure it would work. Especially not when we turned to see we were not alone.\n\nFiametta stood behind us, her eyebrows arched high over her brilliant blue eyes, and her black leathers glistening in the flickering light around us. She seemed backlit by a pale pink light. My heart clenched. Was someone manipulating her even now?\n\nBut who?\n\n“What does the Terraling not understand, Peta?”\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nI dropped to one knee and pressed my hands into the rock, feeling the essence of the earth under my skin as Spirit still rode high through my veins. I could feel the beating heart of everyone within fifty feet, including the queen and the Ender below us.\n\nBrand stared at me from a few steps behind the queen. “Terraling, you are supposed to be helping my wife.”\n\nLetting out a slow breath I nodded and stood, the instinct to connect to the earth something I’d not expected. “She sent me with Cactus, since I fell into the river helping her with the laundry.”\n\nCactus tugged at my arm; I knew what he wanted. We hadn’t addressed Fiametta yet. Faux pas number one.\n\n“Your Majesty,” I said.\n\n“Terraling, I see you are getting the grand tour while your friend awaits his punishment. How lovely for you.” Fiametta’s voice cracked like a whip through the air and the men flinched. Peta clung to my shoulders, shaking once more. Behind the queen stood her black panther, Jag. His eyes were full of sorrow as he looked at me and then away. But he said nothing. No doubt the queen would just ignore him anyway. I watched as he turned and walked away, leaving his charge on her own.\n\nSo it was as Peta had said. The queen didn’t use her familiar at all.\n\nA scramble of rocks behind us stopped all conversation as the Ender who’d attacked me and Cactus pulled himself over the ledge.\n\nThe queen went to him. From where I stood, her movements softened as she held a hand to him. He kissed her offered hand, his lips lingering on her skin and I saw a quick flash of his tongue as it darted out.\n\nWorm shit and green sticks, of course it would be her lover.\n\nThe epiphany hit me like a dozen redwoods crashing to the forest floor. If he was her lover, he was also the traitor. Son of a bitch, he couldn’t have made it easier on us. If in fact, he was one and the same.\n\nEyes that were dark as night locked with mine as the Ender looked past his queen. “I don’t believe we’ve been introduced, you wyrm lover.” There it was, that same voice I’d heard in the memories.\n\nPeta whispered in my ear. “He will not go down easy. Be wary.”\n\nFiametta turned so she faced me. “Wyrm lover? Coal, what is going on?”\n\nCoal. Of course, his name would be the same as my ex-lover. Seemed fitting since I was about to ruin his life too. He stepped around her, a sly smile on his lips as he pointed a finger at me.\n\n“She attacked me when I was trying to kill a pair of hatchlings.”\n\nI laughed, feeling the weight of the moment laying on me. If I didn’t play this right, we would all be dead. I was not a consummate actress, but I had to try. “Please, why would I attack you? And what is this about a hatchling?”\n\nHe frowned and pointed to the back of his head. “I have a wound. And so does the prick. He tried to stop me and I clubbed him. Proof of my words.”\n\nThe furrowed brows on Fiametta’s face would have made me stop talking, but Coal kept on. She strode to Cactus who held very still, murmuring only a simple, “My queen.”\n\nHer hands roved his face and head, looking for an injury. “I see nothing here, Coal.”\n\n“Impossible. I heard his skull crack,” he said and then seemed to swallow his words as Fiametta turned toward him.\n\nFiametta’s eyes held flames. “You would attack my best defender, Ender? He is the first who stands between me and the firewyrms. That you would even admit this tells me how little you care for our safety. “\n\n“Spitfire—”\n\nI flinched as he used an obvious pet name for her. Her face paled and two bright red spots appeared high on her cheekbones. Coal swallowed whatever else he was going to say. Which was maybe his best decision of the day.\n\nShe raised her left hand and held it palm out toward him. “You are hereby stripped of your ranks, and all privileges. I see no wounds on Cactus, but he is a favored Salamander in our eyes and that you would even attack him leaves me questioning your loyalty.”\n\nConfidence soaring, I had to fight the smile that wanted to creep over my lips. This really was too easy. “He has a scar on his hand, does he not? Hidden under his glove.”\n\nCoal’s whole body jerked as if I’d jammed my knee into his family jewels. Fiametta looked from him to me. “Ender, do you know this Terraling?”\n\n“No, my queen.” Interesting that his story was suddenly changing. Anything to keep on the queen’s good side.\n\n“Oh, sure you do,” I said, feeling the weight of the situation as if a boulder lay across my shoulders and not a ten-pound house cat.\n\n“I’ve never met her, my queen.” He was sweating, and I didn’t think it was heat. I glanced from him to Fiametta only to find her blue eyes staring at me.\n\nI forced a smile to my lips as my mind raced. Think like Belladonna, that was all I could think. “Do you trust your Ender? Trust that he wouldn’t lie to you? Oh, what am I saying, he did lie to you just now. Right to your face.”\n\nHer blue eyes narrowed to mere slits. “Terraling, you walk a fine line. Do remember that while you are here, you must abide by my rules until you leave. Or you will find yourself next to your friend making a last, short walk into the Pit together.”"

        "content": "Damn, a fine line indeed. I lifted both hands, palms up and shrugged. “If you wish to bed a viper and think his bite is not venomous, then be my guest. I will say no more, per your wishes.” Turning, I beckoned to Cactus whose face was slack as if I’d punched him in the mouth. “Cactus, you said you would show me the Pit as close as I could get?”\n\n“Stop.” Fiametta said, her voice icy cold, but power rumbled under it and the lava below us picked up in noise, as though fountains spurted with the wicked fire. There was no emotion in Fiametta’s voice. I had her attention now. I turned expecting her command to be for me. It wasn’t.\n\nThe Ender—her lover and traitor—was attempting to sprint away. Cactus stepped beside me, lifted his hand and the doorway that the Ender would have run through crumbled, most effectively stopping him.\n\nHe spun and lifted his club, pointing it at Fiametta. The fear on him was so thick it seemed to fill the air.\n\n“You bitch, you have ruined this family!”\n\nI was the closest one to him and I acted without truly considering what I was doing.\n\nPulling Peta from my shoulder I pushed her behind me as I sprinted forward, putting myself between the Ender and Fiametta—of course, I had no weapon.\n\nThe Ender laughed. “You think to protect her? She doesn’t deserve your protection.”\n\nI settled into a fight stance. “Leave that to me to decide.”\n\n“Lark, here, you could need this.” Brand called out as the sound of metal and wood scraped along the smooth granite. Rolling to a stop at my feet was my spear, the curved blade, and wooden handle once held by my mother. I scooped it up, and spun it toward the Ender as he raced toward me with his club. The blade caught on the dark stone as we twisted our weapons against one another. My muscles strained and my shoulder protested but I held him back, if only just barely.\n\n“Coal, stop this,” Fiametta said and for just a second I wanted to glance around for the dark hair and green eyes of my previous lover. But of course, this Coal was the Salamander in front of me. And I had no doubt he would kill me if I let my guard down for an instant.\n\n“The last Coal I faced lost his hand,” I said as I thrust my spear toward his belly, turning the move into a downward slash and catching his knee. The tip of my blade cut through his leathers and the side of his knee. He went down but swept his club in front of him keeping me away. His black eyes glittered with hate, and I read the understanding in them that he was going to die.\n\nI took a step back, spinning my spear loosely in front of my body.\n\nFiametta stepped forward so we stood side by side, but her eyes were all for her lover. “You would kill me?”\n\nHe never lowered his eyes and I waited for the moment he would strike. “A thousand times over.”\n\n“Why?”\n\nCoal shook his head. “I will say no more.”\n\nFiametta tipped her head and I thought for a brief moment I saw a quiver of sorrow flicker over her face. “Coal, drop your weapons.”\n\nHe shook his head as he slowly stood, hobbling on one leg. “No. Kill me and be done with it.”\n\nFiametta spared me a look. “Can you take him without killing him?”\n\nHere was a chance I would not have again to gain her good graces. “If that is what you wish.”\n\n“Do it.”\n\nI stepped in front of her again and slowly shifted my spear so I held the shaft near the blade and the blunt end was aimed at Coal.\n\n“I will force you to kill me.”\n\nI had no doubt he would do just that. “Fiametta, will you allow me to question him?”\n\nShe snorted softly. “You think you can make him speak without torture?”\n\n“I know more than he realizes,” I said, the balls of my feet aching with the need to move. I reached for the part of me that was anything but Terraling. Spirit flowed through me and I focused on Coal. On loosening his tongue and making him spill his secrets. Coal eyed me up as he spoke.\n\n“We never met, you never even looked my way when we picked you and your friend out of the Rim.” His eyes bugged as he realized he spoke freely, doing exactly what he said he wouldn’t.\n\n“The first night you bedded the queen, you were searching for something in her room. What is it?” I asked.\n\nBehind me Fiametta sucked in a sharp breath and Coal’s eyes looked over my shoulder. Like the sound of a tornado being unleashed, the oxygen around me was sucked away in a gulping whoosh. A furred body hit me, slamming me to the ground. Peta in her full leopard form crouched over me as the wave of pure lava rolled through the air, and wrapped around Coal. The liquid fire shimmered and shifted in the air, a living coil of death rippling from the queen’s outstretched hands.\n\nShifting my gaze back to Coal, I stared in horror as the lava wrapped around his middle. His head rolled back as a scream ripped from his mouth—a scream that turned into a gurgle—his body was burned in half, his innards gone in a burst of ash and nothing else. Shocked beyond words, I was unable to look away, unable to believe what I was seeing. What happened to Salamanders being immune to the heat of fire and lava?\n\nBut more importantly, what was Fiametta hiding that would make her go against her own decree? Something she was willing to give up a traitor and his connections, a lover she’d held in her arms, to protect.\n\nPeta’s eyes met mine and I put a hand on her head. “Thanks.”\n\n“That’s four times now, Terraling.”\n\nI swallowed hard. “I think you’ll get at least a few more chances to pull my ass from the fire before we’re out of here.”"

        "content": "She bobbed her head. “I believe you may be right.”\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nPeta stayed crouched over me, as the lava in the air receded like a wave pulled out to sea. “Be wary, Dirt Girl. The queen is most dangerous when she is scared. And I believe she is terrified.”\n\nI rolled to my back and found myself looking up at the queen. Her blue eyes stared down at me, but it was the two high spots on her cheeks that told me Peta was right. They were the only sign of emotion I’d seen on her.\n\nI started to get up but she held a hand over me, the palm shimmering with a red glow. “Do not move, Terraling. How did you know he was a traitor?”\n\nWorm shit and green sticks, there was no way I could tell her about my ability with Spirit. Not if Cactus was right about the way she used people. I swallowed hard.\n\nFrom Peta came a single word reverberating through me.\n\nLie.\n\nBut lies had a way of being outed so I went with the closest thing to the truth I could. “He bragged about it to someone else when I was supposed to be unconscious. That he was bedding you while he searched for ‘it.’”\n\nHer eyes narrowed. “And how did you know about his hand, and the scar? He rarely takes his gloves off.”\n\nUnless he was in bed with her were the unspoken words. Which of course would mean I’d spied on them during the act. Which I had, though it wasn’t my fault.\n\nUnder my back, the smooth stone slowly heated, as if the lava below was picking up on the queen’s mood. Not a good sign.\n\nCactus cleared his throat and the queen’s gaze swung to the left. “You have something to tell me, Cactus?”\n\n“Yes, my queen. Lark told me what she’d heard, and we were going to speak to Brand about it. Lark didn’t know who the scar belonged to.” Which didn’t answer how I’d seen it, but maybe the diversion would work.\n\nPeta, quiet through all the talk, slowly put herself between Fiametta and me, as the tension continued to rise. Fiametta was no fool, that much was clear.\n\nI swallowed hard, but otherwise didn’t move. Fiametta turned to me, the heat from her hand directly over my heart. “Who was he speaking to?”\n\n“I don’t know. I only heard him speak and saw him scratch at his scar before I blacked out again.”\n\nHer eyes narrowed to mere slits. “And you didn’t think you were dreaming?”\n\n“I know what I heard.” I took a chance, one that would either put her at ease or make her kill me right there. I sat up, which put her hand right in front of my face. “Fiametta, you’re friends with Cassava. You should know better than anyone that as part of the Rim, I can say I know the difference between dreams and reality with absolute clarity.”\n\nShe lowered her hand, but continued to stare down at me, her face unreadable. “Yes, I suppose you would have to learn that if you want to survive in her family.”\n\nHer family. Like Cassava still ruled the Rim. I itched to put Fiametta to the question. To ask her all she knew about Cassava and the bitch’s plans. Almost as much as that, I wanted to know what was hidden in her room. Something she was willing to kill someone she cared about in order to keep hidden.\n\nThe queen of the Pit took a step back. “You willingly stepped in front of me when I would have otherwise been attacked. For that I will give you credit.”\n\n“I saved your life,” I said. “Give me Ash’s, surely your life is worth that of a simple Ender who you have no care for.”\n\nPeta let out a barely audible hiss. “Too far.”\n\nI pushed to my feet and dusted my clothes off. Too far it might have been, but I had to ask. I had to push if I was to save Ash’s life.\n\nFiametta laughed and I was surprised at the soft tones of it. A real laugh, one not hidden behind the mask of royalty. “You think so? I do not. As queen, my life is not worth more than those of my Enders, nor any of my people. I would lay down my life for any of them, Terraling.”\n\nHer words stopped me. Maybe she wasn’t as much like Cassava as I’d been thinking.\n\n“Then you won’t give him even a measure of mercy?”\n\n“No. Four lives were taken at his hands. Four. At best, I could credit him a single life, except I was still forced to take the life of yet another Ender, one who also filled a spot in my bed.” She lifted an eyebrow, her lips quirking upward at the edges. “Unless perhaps you’d like to take his place?”\n\n“As an Ender for the Pit?” I was confused and struggled to understand until she gave me a soft smile, her eyes sparkling with humor and desire.\n\nOh shit. I’d thought the thing about her libido was exaggerated. Apparently not so much.\n\nI gave her a bow from the waist. “Thank you, but I do believe I will have to forgo your offer. I am only here for three days after all.”\n\nHer face closed off and she inclined her head. “You know more than you say, and I believe there is more to you than you let on—”\n\n“I am an Ender,” I said softly. “Nothing else. I will do what I must to protect those in my care. No matter who they are.”\n\nHer eyes went cold again, and I knew I’d struck a chord I hadn’t meant to.\n\n“You may visit your friend once. That is the gift I offer you for placing your life in front of mine.” She turned and strode toward the entrance Cactus had collapsed. He scrambled to get it open for her, lifting the rock and pushing it all to one side. The queen never looked back, and I realized just how scared I’d been facing her. My legs shook and I had to lock my knees to keep them from buckling."

        "content": "Peta shrunk to her housecat form and she trotted to my side. “Dirt Girl, what are you doing, turning the queen down? When she beckons you to her bed, you go!”\n\nI snorted. “Flattered as I was, I cannot fake desire.”\n\n“If you want to survive the Pit, perhaps you’d best learn how to ‘fake’ it, as you say,” she grumbled at me. I scooped her up and kissed her on the nose.\n\n“Peta, I love you.”\n\n“Gah, put me down, Terraling!”\n\n“You see?” I let her down. “I cannot fake it.”\n\nBrand took a few steps after the queen, then turned and looked at me. “Peta is right, no one turns down the queen.”\n\nI arched an eyebrow at him. “Not even you?”\n\n“Not even me.” There was sadness and regret in his eyes. I thought about Smoke, about her having to share him with their beautiful, but-oh-so-deadly, queen.\n\n“Perhaps if more people stood up to her, she wouldn’t be such a power hungry bitch.” Yet even as I said the words, I realized that wasn’t the case. She’d shown that she placed her life on par with all her people’s lives. Though it did not help Ash any, I could give her credit that she at least didn’t set her life above theirs.\n\nAnd then I realized I’d lost my one bargaining chip. The traitor was dead, and I was no further ahead in getting Ash out of the Pit. Damn it to the seven hells and back.\n\nI made my decision quickly. “She said I could see Ash.”\n\n“No, not yet,” Brand said. I bent and picked up my spear, twisting it in half and hanging it from my belt in two pieces.\n\n“Two questions, Brand.” I crossed my arms and lifted an eyebrow at him. “Why can I not see him now, and where the hell did you get my spear?”\n\n“Your spear was sent by your father. And you can’t see Ash because he is healing.”\n\nMy father . . . my brain struggled to comprehend. “My father sent my spear. And you let me have it?”\n\nAnd then the second half of what Brand said hit home, and I stepped toward him, hands dropping into fists. “What do you mean he is healing?”\n\nBrand shrugged. “Ash started a fight with one of the other prisoners. So he’s a bit bruised up. As to your father, here, he sent a note with the spear. It got here just a few moments before I saw you on the ledge up here. You can have it only because I am vouching for you. Again. Use it on anyone and I will be in the dungeons with you.”\n\n“Why would you do that?”\n\n“You just pulled a traitor down and you’ve been here for less than a day. You tell me why I’m trusting you.” He pulled a sealed envelope from inside his black leather top and handed it to me. The seal was green wax with a perfect blooming tree imprint. I ran a thumb over it, fear filling me. Without opening it, I tucked it into my vest. “Thank you. For this and for trusting me.”\n\nBrand nodded. “Lark, you have done as I asked and ousted the traitor. Now I must hold to my end of the bargain. Ash wanted to get you out of here. You’ve seen just how dangerous the Pit is. And now you have sparked the interest of the queen. Please, reconsider—”\n\n“No, I’m staying until either I get Ash out or . . .” my guts tightened as I realized I might not be able to save him. I might be staying to watch him die and be a final witness to his sacrifice for me. My throat burned and filled with a thick lump. I had to swallow several times to force it down. “Or the three days is up,” I finally managed. Then there was the issue of the firewyrms. They were being killed off and I had to do something; I felt it in the core of my bones that I couldn’t leave them to Fiametta’s culling.\n\nBrand’s eyes softened and lifted his hand as if to pat me on the shoulder. My jaw twitched and he must have seen something in my eyes because he withdrew his hand. “The sleep bell will ring soon. Go.” He turned and went down the stairs closest to us without another word.\n\n“Cactus—”\n\nMy friend took my hand and led me away, and I let him. “He’s right, Lark. We need to get back to my place before we pass out in the halls.”\n\nThe thought of sleeping and unable to wake in one of the myriad of labyrinthine hallways gave me a chill I did not like. Still, I pulled my hand from his.\n\n“And I suppose you’re going to tell me we need to leave without Ash too?”\n\nCactus laughed. “No, if you still have the heart of the girl I grew up with, I know we aren’t leaving without Ash. One way or another. But with the traitor dead, what other option do you have? Do you have another way to save Ash?”\n\nIn that moment I loved him more than a little. He didn’t try to sway me from my chosen course of action, but backed me.\n\nThat didn’t mean I had any sort of idea what I was going to do. Climbing up the stairs that had taken us to the edge of the Pit, it didn’t take long for my legs to feel the strain. It reminded me of my Ender training, which, while it seemed a lifetime ago, had been less than six months past.\n\nMy teacher had been Granite, a man I’d trusted, respected and thought was my friend. It turned out that not only was he not my friend, he was actively trying to wipe out my family alongside Cassava. Still, a part of me wished I could ask him what to do. He’d been an Ender long before I’d been born, and even though he’d been a traitor to my father, he was known for his brilliant tactics. So far I’d managed to survive both Cassava’s treachery and the dark secrets within the Deep, but both times had been based on strength and fighting ability more than anything else."

        "content": "There was nothing here for me to physically fight; I needed to outsmart these Salamanders within their own home. And I wasn’t sure I could do it.\n\nPeta trotted at my side and I glanced down at her. The sight of her white tipped tail made me smile despite the hard situation at hand. I realized I had the perfect helper if she would open to me. Living in the Pit as a familiar, surely she would have an idea as to how to save Ash? I just didn’t know if she would trust me enough to help me. Her antagonism was not exactly subtle even though she was softening toward me.\n\nThe three of us remained silent as we emerged from the downward tunnel into the main living quarters cavern. Cactus walked me back to Smoke and Brand’s home. He stopped in front of the open door, leaning against the edge of it. “I’d take you with me, but people might talk.” He gave me a slow wink.\n\nI snorted, opened my mouth to respond when his eyes widened as he looked over my shoulder. Damn these Salamanders and their penchant for creeping around in complete silence. I arched an eyebrow at Cactus and he gave a slight shake of his head. So whoever was behind me was no one I wanted to talk to apparently. Keeping my back to whomever, I spoke to them. “Sneaking up on people? Isn’t that below you?”\n\nA sharp intake of breath and then a fist jammed between my shoulder blades, throwing me forward. I spun as I fell, catching a glimpse of bright red curls.\n\nMaggie glared down at me. “I’m here to make sure you do as told. The queen thinks Brand is going soft.”\n\n“Or maybe you asked for this duty? A reason to push me around?” I stood and didn’t bother to hide my anger. With that emotion running through me I could truly tap into the earth’s power and feel as though I could hold my own against any other elemental. I let the anger burn bright, feeding it with the fact Maggie had been the first to stand against me and Ash when we’d come for help.\n\n“If you’d helped us when we asked, instead of fighting us, we could have been in and out of the Pit without anyone even knowing, Maggie. None of this would have happened. No one would have died.”\n\nMaggie glared at me. “If you had taken our advice and left, no one would have died.”\n\n“My whole family would have!” I shouted at her, unable to contain the words in any sort of moderation.\n\nShe snorted. “And the world would have been a better place for that.”\n\nSeveral gasps around us told me I was not the only one who thought she’d gone too far.\n\nMaggie’s hands glowed a soft red as she called on her element and I watched closely as a tiny flame burst into life over the top of her hand. She rolled it over her knuckles, the fire dancing across her skin. “You’re going to die here, Larkspur. It won’t matter that your father is the king of the Rim, or that you’re an Ender. It won’t matter that you saved the queen.”\n\nCactus stepped around me and the colors that swirled up his arms blended green and red twinning about one another as the tiny rocks at our feet slowly rose in the air. “Do not threaten her, Maggie.”\n\nMaggie laughed and put her hands on her hips, the fire dancing from her hands to race around the edge of her body. “Being a tad over dramatic, aren’t we? I’m not killing her. Yet.”\n\nI lifted a hand to Cactus, ignoring her. “Thanks for showing me around.”\n\nI turned my back on Maggie. She snarled and I dodged to the right as she crashed toward me, the flash of black leathers my only warning. She clipped my shoulder, spinning me into the house and against a long pair of legs. I looked up into Smoke’s eyes.\n\n“Lark, what is going on?”\n\n“Maggie’s lost it,” I spit out.\n\nMaggie grabbed my ankles and dragged me out of the house before I could say anything else.\n\n“Maggie, stop this!” Smoke cried out.\n\nMaggie tightened her grip on me and picked up speed. “No, I lost rank because of her and I’m about to fix that.”\n\nI had no idea what she was talking about, but I suspected that “fixing” things would mean a beating for me, or worse.\n\nShe had me out of the house, and was running backward as she dragged me along the open ground. The rough footing tore at my vest and pants, tearing at the few spots where my skin hit. And then I realized where she was dragging me.\n\nThe river of lava.\n\nOh, that was not happening. I jerked both legs at the same time, snapping my knees against my chest, which pulled Maggie toward me, her orange eyes wide with surprise.\n\nI tipped my head forward as she inadvertently launched up my body, and her forehead crashed into the top of mine. The reverberation from the impact shuddered down my spine and my shoulder gave a distant twinge, but I was no longer playing nice. I rolled with Maggie as her eyes widened with shock. Grabbing her by the shoulders as I straddled her waist, I thumped her hard into the ground, anger slicing through any hesitation I might have had.\n\nTwo more times I slammed her into the ground, her head bouncing with enough force that I almost felt bad. Almost.\n\nI let her go and stood, breathing hard so it took me a moment to realize there was an eerie silence in the air. Around me were other fire elementals, their strange eyes in every shade of orange and yellow imaginable staring at me with nothing short of fear.\n\nA few of them clung to their powers, the red lines licking up their arms indicating how close they were to blasting me. I slowly lifted my hands, feeling the weight of every move I made. “She started it.”\n\n“You are a guest here,” Smoke’s voice was soft but with an edge. A rebuke if I ever heard it."

Don’t expect that I won’t defend myself.”\n\nThe crowd dispersed, although more than one Salamander looked over their shoulder at me. The dislike reminded me strongly of Peta’s own distaste for me and apparently all Terralings.\n\nTurning, I looked for Cactus. He was walking away, too, taking an unconscious Maggie with him. And he didn’t look back. A sigh slipped out of me and Smoke touched my shoulder gently.\n\n“You are right, you have to defend yourself, but in front of so many people? That will not help you or your friend.” She shook her head, her eyes sorrowful. “Come, eat.”\n\nPeta gave a meow and I instinctively held out my arms. She leapt up and worked her way up to my shoulder. “You should have smashed her at least twice more.”\n\nI startled and looked up at the cat. “You aren’t going to tell me I should have let her pulverize me?”\n\nShe snorted and shook her head. “No, showing weakness in the Pit will get you killed. The others fear you now; they saw you beat Maggie’s ass in a matter of seconds. That is why she came at you. You’ve beaten her once and she lost standing, losing to a mere Dirt Girl. Now you’ve beaten her a second time. She will look for another way to get at you. So we will have to be extra vigilant.”\n\nI wished I could believe Peta that I’d done the right thing. Maybe in some ways I had, but I knew one thing for sure. No matter what happened, Maggie and I would never be friends.\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nBrand came for the family meal, and though he said nothing to me about the fight with Maggie, I felt his disappointment. He and Smoke shared more than one glance across the table and their three boys were remarkably quiet. Until the plates were cleared.\n\nTinder shifted in his seat. “Did you really beat up Maggie?”\n\nI looked from the boy to his father.\n\nBrand leaned back and crossed his arms over his chest. “Go ahead. Tell him.”\n\nPeta looked up from my lap, her green eyes unblinking. “Yes, tell him.”\n\nPutting my hands on the table edge, I nodded.\n\n“Yes, I knocked her out. She came at me from behind.” Maybe that would be enough.\n\nTinder’s eyes widened and his tiny mouth opened into a perfect O. “And you still beat her?”\n\nPeta stretched, her back arching into a perfect curve as she stepped off my lap and onto the table. “Terralings are not to brag. They’re humble, unlike you lizards.”\n\nBrand seemed to be holding back a smile as Peta crossed the table. Smoke glowered but only for a second.\n\nPeta pushed up onto her back two legs, front paws stretched into the air. “Magma leapt at her from behind and the Dirt Girl sensed it coming. She rolled with Magma tackling her. And BAM! the first punch smashed its target.” The cat dropped to all fours and rolled over then popped into the air to land flat on her belly. Apparently my familiar was a natural born storyteller.\n\n“What happened next?” Tinder whispered, his tiny fists pressed under his chin.\n\nPeta dragged herself across the table with her front claws, weaving one way and then the other. “Magma raced backward, dragging the Terraling by her ankles. Right to the lava flow.”\n\nTinder gasped and his fists shook with suppressed emotion. “What then?”\n\nPeta slithered on her belly until she was hidden behind one of the dishes. “It looked as though Magma would throw her into the lava flow. But the Terraling used her legs, jerking Magma off balance, cracking their heads against one another.”\n\n“And because she is a Terraling her skull is harder than Magma’s?” Tinder asked and Peta rolled onto her back and jabbed her four feet into the air as if in a four-legged boxing match.\n\n“Exactly.” She paused and rolled into attack position, her body wiggling with suppressed movement. “The Dirt Girl grabbed Magma by the shoulders and slammed her against the ground three times.” Peta’s head bobbed up and down. “BAM BAM BAM. Each time harder than the last until she was satisfied Magma would not be coming around anytime soon.” At the last second, Peta leapt toward Tinder, landing right in front of his face. He squealed and laughed and she sat and looked over her shoulder at me.\n\nI shook my head. “You see, that is not much at all.”\n\nStryker grinned at me. “That’s huge. Maggie is a tough Ender. Dad always says so, and now you’ve beaten her twice. I’d watch my back. She’ll want another go at you.” His words echoing what Peta had already cautioned.\n\n“Wonderful,” I muttered.\n\nSmoke clapped her hands. “Boys, off to bed. The bell will ring soon.” The three boys scrambled up and I was surprised as each of them went by me, touching two fingers to the top of their opposite hand, and then repeating the gesture to the top of mine.\n\nI waited until they were gone deeper into the house before I lifted an eyebrow at Brand. “What was that about?”\n\n“They were showing their respect for you. Touching your hand like that is acknowledging that you have more power than them.” His eyes dropped and he let out a yawn. “Don’t expect it from me, though.”\n\nI laughed but it was forced. I let Smoke lead me to a simply made-up room that looked comfortable. The bed was bigger than the one I had in our Enders Barracks, the thin, pale-blue silk sheets beckoning. My body craved sleep despite the rest I’d had at Cactus’s place."

        "content": "Thanking Smoke, I waited for her to leave before I sat on the edge of the bed. Peta sat at my feet, reached up with her front paws and dug them into the bed then stretched her back. She cracked a yawn. “The bell is coming.”\n\n“I need to stay awake,” I said, looking straight into the light tube that lit my room. By the color of the light, I figured time was closing on the night. “I have to find a way to get Ash out of here and I only have two days left.”\n\nPeta pulled herself onto the bed beside me. “And you think you can withstand the bell when it rings? No one stays awake. The mother goddess herself would have to help you withstand the sleep bell.”\n\n“So be it then. I will ask her.”\n\nWith everyone else asleep, the night was the perfect time to search. Besides, if Peta was right, how did the Ender Coal stay awake to search the Queen’s chambers? How had the queen woken when she’d heard him? If they could stay awake, then there was no reason I couldn’t either.\n\nI knelt on the floor and placed my hands on the solid stone underneath me. Breathing out slowly, I tried to form the right words, the ones that would bring the mother goddess to me.\n\nA deep booming gong sounded, like thunder rolling over clear blue skies. The echo hit my body like a physical blow and I gasped. “Mother goddess, I must stay awake.”\n\nThe power of Spirit will protect you, child. You do not need me.\n\nHer voice was a soothing balm over my fears and I sat quietly as three more booms echoed through the Pit. Beside me Peta snorted. “Damn, you truly are a child of Spirit, aren’t you?”\n\n“How do you know this? How do you know anything about Spirit?”\n\nShe hesitated and I saw the struggle in her as she tried to fight the urge to help me more than she had to. I felt her emotions, there, at the edge of my mind. Worry, regret, and uncertainty.\n\nI put a hand on her back as gently as I could. “I won’t share your secrets, Peta.”\n\nHer eyes flicked to mine then away. “My first charge, years ago, was a child of Spirit. I am the last familiar that ever watched over one such as you. I believe that is why the mother goddess assigned me as your familiar.”\n\nA breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding whooshed out of me. “You really can help me then.”\n\n“I think so.” The uncertainty was there again. “But you must understand, he was fully trained when I was given to him as a kitten. I know what he was capable of, but I don’t know how he did what he did.”\n\nWithout thinking, I scooped her up and pressed my face against her. I hadn’t realized how much fear I’d carried about that part of me until Peta said she could guide me. I held her with my eyes closed and she purred.\n\n“I’m so glad you are here,” I whispered. “No matter what happens.”\n\nHer rough tongue flicked once over my cheek. “So am I, Dirt Girl. But if you tell anyone, I will claw your face to ribbons while you sleep.”\n\nSmiling, I shifted her to my shoulder, her claws digging into the leather vest for balance.\n\nI knew where I wanted look first. Smoke’s earlier words were my only clue to go on. “Peta, we need to go to the healer’s rooms.”\n\n“Are you ill?” The concern in her voice and the feeling of worry coursing through her into me was touching.\n\n“No, I just . . . I need to see where the Enders were treated. Where they died. There could be a clue as to what happened to them.”\n\nShe tipped her chin forward. “Then let us go.”\n\nOpening my door, I listened for a moment. The home was quiet and I crept out, stopping in the main room to grab my spear. With my luck, I would need it, even though everyone was asleep.\n\nCreeping into the main cavern, the weight of the silence was like a living breathing boogey man that waited in the shadows. The light tubes dulled to a dim glow with only the moon’s light reflecting through the mountain to us, giving the place a strange iridescence.\n\nPeta sniffed the air. “I’ve never been awake at night inside the mountain, it feels different.”\n\n“Like something is waiting for us,” I said and her claws dug in tightly.\n\n“Dirt Girl. Those are not words you want to utter out loud.”\n\nI thought of Scar and wondered how many of the firewyrms were left.\n\nI broke into a jog, heading for the bridge, the lava bubbling happily under it. “Why not?”\n\n“There are creatures in the Pit that even the queen would not face. Beasts from long ago that sleep under the lava.”\n\n“Like the firewyrms.”\n\n“Yes, like them. And others. Others I have never had the displeasure of meeting. Creatures that would make the Deep seem a playground and the Rim like Heaven.”\n\n“Lovely.”\n\nWe reached the bridge and hurried across, the heat chasing me. My skin was dry to the point of tiny cracks appearing across it. Soon they would break open and bleed as they begged for moisture. Thoughts of the Deep emerged and suddenly going back didn’t seem like that much of a hardship.\n\n“Take this opening.” Peta flicked one paw as if shaking off droplets of water. I jogged into the cavern hallways and came to a sudden halt. The hallways that had been lit during the day were dark, not one embedded flame in the wall, not one flicker of fire to show us the way.\n\n“Peta, how well can you see in the dark?”\n\n“I need at least a glimmer. Even I cannot see in total darkness.”\n\nI backed into the main cavern. We weren’t far from the singles quarters. “Cactus might have something we can use, a torch perhaps.”"

        "content": "Peta nodded and I ran toward his home. Cactus’s place was easy to find with all the junk and garbage surrounding it. I pushed a few things around with my feet looking for something that would work as a torch before giving up on my search and going into his house. The plants growing around us leaned in toward me. I lifted a hand to a young bamboo plant shooting out of the ground. If I stuffed the end with a bit of cloth, it would work for a torch.\n\n“Forgive me,” I whispered as I took my spear and cut the bamboo at the ground. It would grow back, but even so, I didn’t take lightly to cutting it down. Searching through Cactus’s place for some fabric or cloth, I found myself at his bedroom door.\n\nPeta shook her head, her eyes catching mine. “Don’t go in there, Dirt Girl. You won’t like it.”\n\nAs if that would make me walk away. I slowly pushed the door open. Cactus was sprawled on his bed, his naked torso raising and falling with his deep breaths. I sucked in a sharp breath.\n\nBeside him lay Maggie, her riotous curls spread over his pillow, and her body also naked, her armor spread over the floor as if it had been taken off and dropped where she stood.\n\n“Shit,” I whispered even though I knew they wouldn’t wake. “I didn’t mean to beat up his girlfriend.”\n\nWhich explained why he hadn’t looked back when he’d left. I refused to feel anything, refused to acknowledge it hurt my feelings that he would sleep with Maggie of all people. I bent and grabbed one of his shirts from the floor and wrapped it around the end of the bamboo. A small part of me hoped it was one of his favorites.\n\n“Are you upset, Dirt Girl?” Peta asked.\n\n“Why would I be upset?” Why indeed? I had no claim on him other than friendship.\n\n“Because he kissed you today and I feel how much you care for him. This is a betrayal. Why does it not bother you?”\n\n“And I have kissed Ash. Neither of them are my bedmates, play mates, or anything between those. Friends, that is all.” The words came out a little harsher than I’d planned and I let out a breath. “Okay, maybe it bothers me a little, but I can’t be surprised. Cactus lives here, this is his home.”\n\n“But he wants to escape,” she pointed out.\n\nI left Cactus and Maggie sleeping peacefully and headed back the way we’d come. “Yes, he does. That doesn’t mean he won’t enjoy what is left of his stay here.”\n\nI went to the bridge and stood at the edge, dipping the torch close to the rolling river of liquid death. Before the material even touched the surface, it burst into flames. Stepping back, I held the torch aloft and went to the opening. Stepping into the darkness, the torch didn’t throw the light as far as I would have liked but Peta gave a chirping sound.\n\n“I can see. But your torch won’t last so we must hurry.”\n\nKnowing she was right I broke into a slow jog, taking the turns and twists as Peta directed until I stood in front of the healer’s rooms. She took us on a direct route, and the rooms weren’t as far away as they’d seemed when others had led us.\n\nThe rod of Asclepius etched into the double doors glittered in the torchlight. Under the flickering flame, the snake looked far more like a firewyrm than any other reptile, now that I’d met a firewyrm in person. I slowed and put my hand on the door, half expecting it to be locked. But it opened easily and I stepped inside, shutting the door quickly. Setting the torch into a wall scone, I peered around me, taking the place in.\n\nThe room was empty of patients, and clean of any blood that may have been spilled. Around the edge of the room, a counter was built into the wall, and on it were tools of the healer’s trade. Scalpels, knives, ointments, and herbals for a variety of ailments, bandages, wraps, and splints set aside, ready at a moment’s notice. But none of that was what I needed.\n\n“Where would they put those who are critically injured? And would they have taken notes?” I placed a hand on one of the empty beds, leaning on it.\n\nPeta hopped from my shoulder and trotted around the room, sniffing. “I don’t know. What are we looking for?”\n\nThat was the question I wasn’t sure I had an answer to. I cupped the back of my neck with my hands. “I don’t know exactly. Evidence of some sort.”\n\n“That is not helpful, Dirt Girl.”\n\n“Just see if anything sticks out to you.” I walked around the room, touching the jars of herbs and salves, ointments for burns mostly. Which was interesting. “Why do so many Salamanders get burned when they are immune to the flames?”\n\n“Normally they don’t but lately there have been injuries of that kind for many of them. Usually the salves are saved for those who are visiting the Pit,” Peta jumped onto the counter that ran around the entire room, putting her nose into several jars, sneezing in one.\n\nHer nose twitched. “Occasionally a death occurs because a child who is too young tries to swim in the lava.”\n\nI shuddered. “Why would they let them do that?”\n\n“They don’t. These are children in their early teenage years who believe they are invincible.” Peta’s voice grew sad. “One of my charges was just such a child.”\n\nGut wrenching grief flowed from Peta into me and I had to clamp down on the tears that threatened. Tears that would burn my face with their heat and the remembrance of my own loss.\n\n“Peta—”\n\n“Shhhh.” She hissed, her eyes narrowing and her ears twitching. “Hide. Someone is coming.”\n\nCHAPTER 12"

        "content": "Worm shit and green sticks. I scrambled for one of the beds, sliding under it with far more noise than was good. The butt of my spear bounced off the floor and I grabbed it, pulling it tight to my side as the door creaked open. A tiny figure cloaked in a dark material from head to foot slipped in; the very same one I’d seen at the edge of the river.\n\nWhoever she was, she would have barely come up to the top of my breasts, so maybe five feet tall at best. Other than that, I could see no distinguishing features. If she was Cassava, she’d found a way to hide her height as well as her features. Whoever she was, she hid behind a spell that cloaked her, hiding her. This was no ghost, no specter.\n\nShe crept through the healer’s room to the counter where the healing balms were and grabbed a jar of ointment. Spinning around she searched the room and I held my breath.\n\n“Who is here? I can sense you.” The voice was wavy and distorted and I couldn’t tell if they were even male or female. If it hadn’t been for Smoke’s belief it was a girl, I wasn’t sure I would have thought that.\n\nShe took a few steps toward me and I lay there, thinking that she was about the right size to be Finley. But what the hell would the Queen of the Deep be doing sneaking around the Pit? No, Finley would never stoop to this kind of behavior.\n\nA few more steps and she was at the edge of the bed. Even her feet were cloaked in shadows. I had to give it to her, it was a disguise worth learning.\n\nPeta gave out a high-pitched meow and trotted along the edge of the counter, drawing the attention away from me. The cloaked one spun and stared.\n\n“Damn cats. I hate felines. The first thing I’ll do when I rule the Pit as queen is kill all you snotty creatures.”\n\nWell, now I knew for sure she was a she. Though not a nice girl, that was obvious. Peta let out a long low hiss, her fur standing on end. But she didn’t say anything and the mystery girl slipped out of the healer’s room as quietly as she’d entered. I stayed where I was for another minute before I crawled out.\n\n“Peta, did you—”\n\n“No, I could not even get a scent on her, whatever spell covers her, it is complete. It makes no sense, there are no young rivals for the throne here.” She shook her head.\n\n“Did you see what ointment she took?” Already my mind leapt forward. We could be on the lookout for someone who had whatever injury the girl was trying to heal.\n\n“Burn salve,” Peta said.\n\nI nodded, and debated going after the girl. “That is no ghost.” I stopped and shook my head. “Keep looking, maybe we can still find something solid.”\n\n“Unless you have an idea of what it is you are looking for, I will not keep sniffing jars.” Peta yawned, her tiny jaws cracking wide as she flashed her teeth and rough tongue at me.\n\nI crouched beside her. “I attacked four Enders when I was here, all the injuries were bad, but the two worst happened right here. As soon as I hurt them, the healers were helping them. How could they have died when they had healers—the best in our world—right here?”\n\nPeta’s eyes widened as she caught what I was getting at. “If someone wanted to see you go down in flames, they would only have to make sure the Enders didn’t survive.”\n\n“Exactly. But I have to prove it.” And therein lay the rub. We scoured the room, top to bottom three times over but found nothing out of the ordinary. Until I opened the second to last cupboard. Inside were stacks of paper, labeled with names.\n\n“Peta.”\n\nShe ran to my side, putting her paws on my knee as I crouched. “They would be the most recent, no one has died since then.”\n\nI grabbed the top four pieces of paper.\n\nName: Ender Blaze\n\nInjury: Spear wound to lateral oblique, three ribs broken.\n\nTreatment: Stitches, binding for the ribs, heavy dose of herbals for pain.\n\nPrognosis: Stable, good condition.\n\nName: Ender Flare\n\nInjury: Spear wound to neck, artery cut.\n\nTreatment: Stitches, infusion of blood, heavy dose of herbals for pain.\n\nPrognosis: Stable, good condition.\n\nName: Ender Smudge\n\nInjury: Spear wound to stomach.\n\nTreatment: Stitches, loose wrap, heavy dose of herbals for pain.\n\nPrognosis: Stable, good condition.\n\nName: Ender Stokes\n\nInjury: Spear wound to stomach.\n\nTreatment: Stitches, loose wrap, heavy dose of herbals for pain.\n\nPrognosis: Stable, good condition.\n\nI flipped each of the papers over, seeing the times the healers checked on each of them. “Everything here shows they were all healing, in good spirits,” I whispered.\n\nPeta tapped the paper with a paw. “Until the end.”\n\nThe final line on each paper was simple. DOMC.\n\n“Dead on morning check.” She translated for me.\n\n“Peta, will this help? Will Fiametta even look at this?” And in the back of my head I wondered why the healers hadn’t shown these papers to their queen.\n\nShe wrinkled up her nose. “It’s hard to say. Maybe. It’s your best shot, I think.”\n\nI folded the papers, sliding them under my vest. My fingers brushed against the letter from my father. I still had to read that too, but I was reluctant. A part of me was afraid to see what exactly he had to say.\n\nThe torchlight flickered and I glanced over my shoulder. The bamboo was burnt more than halfway down and Cactus’s shirt was long gone.\n\n“Peta, we’re running out of time.” I grabbed a spool of cloth from the counter top, bandages folded up and ready for an emergency. I wrapped them around the torch hoping to stave off the inevitable."

        "content": "“Hurry up, Dirt Girl. If you don’t want to be found here, then we have to leave.” She ran ahead of me and nudged the door open with her face. I tightened my grip on the torch and took one last look back into the room. I only had to prove the Enders didn’t die as a result of my spear. Injured? Yes, that much I would admit to, but no longer did I feel the weight of their deaths. The papers proved I was not their killer.\n\nPeta ran ahead of me, the tip of her tail a flashing white spot in the darkness. The torch burnt lower, the heat scorching my hand as I took another turn. “Peta, how much farther?”\n\n“A few minutes.”\n\n“We aren’t going to make it.” The torch took that moment to burn my hand, sizzling the skin and forcing me to drop it. The glowing embers littered the floor and Peta ran back to me.\n\n“Looks like we’re sleeping here,” I said.\n\n“No, we can’t. If they find you out of Smoke and Brand’s home, it is the excuse they will use to throw you into jail next to Ash.” Peta spoke quickly and I let out a groan.\n\nI crouched beside her, her green eyes glowing in the last of the light. “Could you find your way out now that we are this close?”\n\n“Yes, but I must be on the ground to smell.”\n\nI nodded and the last of the embers burned out dropping us into a total and complete darkness that was not comfortable in the least. “Call out to me, Peta. I’ll follow your voice.”\n\n“Got it. This way.” Her voice echoed to me and I took a few steps forward, my hand on the wall for guidance. I came to an opening, and I grasped the edge of it.\n\n“Peta?”\n\n“This way, Larkspur.” Her voice came from the right and I turned, following her instructions. Turn after turn and ten minutes turned into fifteen. I paused at the next intersection. “Peta, how much farther?”\n\nThere was no response and I swallowed hard. “Peta?”\n\nA low rumbling laugh echoed through the darkness. “So easy to deceive, little Larkspur. So easy to lead astray. Your familiar is already out of the tunnels and here you are, lost deep within the Pit.”\n\nI flattened my back against the wall and slid away from the intersection. “Who are you?”\n\n“You don’t recognize me? You should.”\n\nMy eyes strained in the darkness, seeing things that weren’t there, flashes of light that were just my mind trying to fill in the utter black. Immediately I thought of the tiny cloaked figure. Twice now I’d seen her and the voice was similar enough, that it could have been her. Or maybe someone cloaking themselves just like her. Smoke said there were two specters. Was I meeting the second?\n\n“No, I don’t recognize you. But then, I rarely waste my time with tricksters,” I said as I slid away from the intersection, back the way I’d come.\n\n“Oh, I am not a trickster, but I do know who killed those Enders. You want to know that secret, don’t you?” Damn it, the voice was everywhere, in front to the left and the right. But that was impossible.\n\nUnless maybe it was someone from the supernatural world; a warlock maybe, or worse yet, a demon. I’d not dealt with the supernatural world, but I’d learned about it as part of my schooling. The power of the elemental world ran in the supernatural bloodlines, giving them abilities they should not have.\n\nI clung to the stone, a low spiral of fear keeping me far away from the anger I needed to tap into my powers. “Are you an elemental?”\n\n“Yes, of course, dear Larkspur. Why would you ask that? Ahh, you think me supernatural in nature. Good guess, but that isn’t what you face.”\n\nThat left only one possibility: he had to be a Spirit user. There was no other answer to the way I felt, the way I’d heard Peta calling me the wrong way, farther into the tunnels. It was a trick Cassava used when she wore the pink diamond, a stone that gave her the powers of a Spirit user.\n\nThere was no way this trickster knew I had that same element running through my veins. I reached out for the part of me that held Spirit and clung to it, wrapping it around me. The warmth sunk through my soul and the fear and confusion slipped away. Holding my breath, I dropped to my knees. If I couldn’t see him, then I doubted he could see me. At least that was what I was hoping for.\n\nSpirit didn’t require me to be angry to tap into it, not like my powers that were connected to the earth. But that didn’t mean Spirit was much help either since I didn’t know what I was doing with it most times.\n\nCrawling on my hands and knees, I tried to sense where he was, the way I’d felt Fiametta earlier in the day. Like a wolf scenting its prey, I crept forward. An image smashed into my skull of Griffin in full wolf form as he loped through the forest, his nose raised to the wind. My skin crawled as if the cool breeze actually coursed along my body.\n\n“Whatever are you doing, dear Larkspur? I smell the Rim as if I stood under the redwoods.” His voice was no longer confident, but had an edge of irritation to it.\n\nBut better yet, his voice no longer rebounded and his words echoed from the left. Pushing myself to the tips of my toes and creeping across the floor on my hands and toe tips, I approached him. A sudden pulse of his heart through the ground below froze me in place.\n\n“Larkspur. Come out now,” he snapped and a flicker of power danced over my skin. I realized he was trying to compel me with Spirit. A grin spread over my lips and I was sure that if he could see it, he would run for his life.\n\nWhoever this was, I was going to catch him and shake him ‘til he spilled his secrets. I scurried forward, my back hunched and my steps silent. The sound of his breathing, the sound of his heart beating was loud in my ears. I leapt toward him, a howl on my lips as Griffin’s wolf spirit seemed to channel through me."

        "content": "He cried out and stumbled backward, screaming. “No!”\n\nWe tumbled to the floor and his hands seemed to be everywhere, punching and hitting . . . and sliding under my vest.\n\nWith a quick snatch he had the papers along with the note from my father. “I don’t think you’ll be needing these.”\n\nRotten worm shit, how had he known? He had to have been spying on me in the healer’s room.\n\nWe rolled and he got loose. I didn’t stop fighting to gain a hold on him, but still I missed him by an inch, the soft material of his clothing brushing my arm and sliding through my fingers as if water. He took off running in the utter darkness. I didn’t hesitate to bolt after him. Holding tight to the pulse of his life in the back of my head, the reverberation of his feet on the stone as he ran I tracked him as easily as if I could see him in front of me.\n\nPumping my arms and legs hard, I closed the distance between us with each stride until his long cloak was tickling at my hands. He took a hard left and I followed but when I turned the corner, he was gone. As if he’d never been and I’d been chasing shadows.\n\n“Son of a fey bitch in heat.” I slapped my hands against the wall and the mountain gave a low rumble in response. Breathing hard, I leaned forward, knowing whoever he was, he wouldn’t be gone long.\n\nAnd whatever he was up to, no way it was good.\n\nOther than losing him, I only had one pressing problem. Lifting my hands in front of me I fumbled forward, completely lost.\n\nAs a child, my mother always told me to sit down if I got lost, and someone would find me. Except I wasn’t supposed to be out of the house, and I’d be damned if I was ending up in prison beside Ash. Again.\n\nI didn’t need to close my eyes to block out the darkness, but I needed to concentrate. There were only two people I could reach.\n\nCactus.\n\nAnd Peta.\n\nSwallowing hard I tried Peta first. When I concentrated, I could feel her emotions in the back of my head, her near panic as she searched for me poured through, and I struggled to breathe evenly. “Easy, Peta. I’m okay.”\n\nShe didn’t calm, but even worse, I couldn’t truly reach her. I didn’t understand the bond between us and how to use it fully.\n\n“Damn.” I rubbed my hands over my face and slid my back down the wall. Dropping my hands to the floor I sent out a tiny pulse of energy, a call through the earth to Cactus. A call that would allow him to find me; if it could break through the sleep spell.\n\nLicking my lips, a thought rolled through my brain. Maybe I could boost the call with Spirit, making Cactus hear me. A trick we’d used as children to reach one another, to sneak out at night and play under the stars.\n\nI sent the call again, this time weaving Spirit around it. “Come on, Cactus.”\n\nThat was all I could do. That and hope if Cactus didn’t find me, Peta would. Or maybe Brand . . . anyone who wouldn’t turn me over to the queen.\n\nI closed my eyes again and slowed my breathing. There was nothing I could do now except wait.\n\nIn that silence, I reviewed the last few months of my life. Of the things I’d done and seen, and the truths I’d faced. The friends I’d gained and lost. “Mother goddess,” I spoke into the darkness, “you said I was your chosen one. And you had me swear my life to you. For what? To bring me here and throw me into danger again?”\n\nThe weight of the darkness grew until the feeling of an arm rested across my shoulders and she whispered in my ear.\n\n“Child, do you really want to know the future? Or would you rather live it and know each choice you make will take you to places you must be? Trust is a strange thing, so tied to fear. Let the fear go, Larkspur. Let it go, and trust not only yourself, but this world and the power of its elements.”\n\nThe feeling of her arm receded and I stood, surprised to find my cheeks wet with tears. “Thank you.”\n\nThere was a soft scuffle of claws on stone and a burst of flame broke through the darkness. Scar blinked up at me, his purple eyes dilated in the bright light. “You’re lost, aren’t you?”\n\nI couldn’t help the bitter laugh. “I am. Think you can help me back to the main cave?”\n\nScar nodded, and his fire went out. “Yes, just put a hand on me.”\n\nI touched the tip of one of his horns that arched over his neck. “Scar, how did you find me?”\n\n“The mother goddess sent me. She said you will save us from Fiametta because you are the only one who can hear us speak.” He moved forward, his gait a smooth side to side motion.\n\n“Why is that, do you think?”\n\n“I don’t know, but the other Spirit Walker can’t hear us. It is like he is deaf to our words.”\n\nI swallowed the sudden burst of excitement. “The other Spirit Walker? You mean the one in the cloak?”\n\n“Yes, that is him. He made us do things ve did not want to. My father learned how to stop him, but now he steals us away.” Scar let out a low sigh. “There aren’t many of us left and . . .” He stopped speaking. “I must leave you here, Spirit Walker. Be careful there is much danger.”\n\nHe flicked his head and I let go of his horn. “Thank you,” I said into the darkness.\n\n“Lark?”\n\nI spun on as a torch flickered down the hallway. “Cactus?”\n\nHe jogged toward me but Peta blasting down the hallway caught my attention. Five feet away she leapt into my arms, her body shaking. “Lark, we have to go, right now.”\n\n“Yes, I know.”"

        "content": "“No, you don’t,” Cactus said, his eyes strained at the edges. “Fiametta is on her way to Brand’s, we saw her in the tunnels. We were just lucky she didn’t see us.”\n\nOh, that was not good in any way, shape, or form. “Then I guess we’d better get our asses in gear.”\n\n“You don’t understand, Lark. We are all supposed to be asleep. And if you are not in your bed, asleep when she gets there. . .” He shook his head.\n\nHe didn’t have to finish his sentence, I understood all too clearly.\n\nIf Fiametta had even an inkling I was doing what I shouldn’t be, I would be toast; perhaps in the most literal sense of the word.\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nPeta clung to me as Cactus ran ahead, the torchlight flickering. “Dirt Girl, who was that calling to you?”\n\nI glanced at her then back to Cactus. “You heard him too?”\n\n“Yes.” Her claws dug into my clothes, the tops of them brushing against my skin. “I tried to stop you but you couldn’t hear me and then . . . I couldn’t find you.” She shivered, her whole body twitching.\n\n“I don’t know who he is, but he can manipulate Spirit; he made it sound like you were calling to me.”\n\nPeta let out a low rumbling hiss. “But you stopped him?”\n\n“For now. He took the papers.”\n\nShe meowed softly in my ear. “He will be back, you think? We will get the papers from him then.”\n\nWe took a hard left turn and I nodded. “I’ve no doubt about it.” I had to believe hope was not lost.\n\nCactus slid to a stop and I almost slammed into him. “Why are we stopping?”\n\nHe pointed to a hole in the wall, the edges jagged and crumbling, the opening not very large. “Crawl through here. It will take you into a deserted home three doors down from Brand’s place. Hurry.”\n\nI didn’t question him, and neither did Peta. “Dirt Girl, go ahead of me this time, I don’t want to lose you again.”\n\nDropping to my knees I leaned into the opening and then lay flat on my belly as I shimmied forward. “How far?”\n\n“Fifty feet.”\n\n“Wonderful,” I muttered, pushing myself in. There wasn’t a lot of room. It wasn’t like I could really build up speed, but I had to try. Frantic to get to Brand’s home ahead of Fiametta, I shoved myself along, my elbows and knees scraping in the dirt; my skin tearing open and filling with bits of rock. Sweat rolled down my face, and for the first time since I’d been in the Pit, it didn’t evaporate right away. Which meant it acted as a perfect fluid for all the dust I stirred up to stick to me.\n\n“Peta, she’s going to know,” I breathed into the shadowy darkness. Ahead of me there was a dim glow that had to be the way out.\n\n“Just keep going. If you’re in bed, she can’t accuse you of being out.”\n\n“I’m covered in sweat and dirt; she isn’t that blind.”\n\n“Dirt Girl, just go.” She swiped a claw at my bare foot and I did as she said and concentrated on the exit. I fell through—finally—and quite literally. The tunnel opened four feet above the ground and I tumbled out, landing in a heap.\n\nPeta leapt out after me and ran for the open door. She peered out and a low hiss escaped her. “Hurry, she is on the bridge.”\n\nScrambling to my feet I lurched forward as I untangled my legs. Reaching the door, I took a quick look. Fiametta was at a distance, but no way would she miss me if making a run for it. If I could see her, she could most assuredly see me.\n\nPressing my back against the rock, I slid out the door toward Brand’s home.\n\n“Run, Dirt Girl,” Peta snapped.\n\n“If I run, her eyes will be drawn to me,” I answered quietly. “You’re a predator, surely you know that.”\n\nShe snorted and then pressed herself against the wall. “I don’t like when you’re right.”\n\n“I don’t like that you didn’t argue she wasn’t a predator.” My back scraped along the wall, my heart hammered and my mind raced. We passed the first two homes with no problem, but Brand’s home would be the clincher. I stood in the shadow of a low overhang between Brand’s home and the one beside it.\n\n“We need to distract her; find a way to get her to look behind her.”\n\n“Can you reach your earth powers?” Peta asked.\n\n“If I’m angry enough.” I looked across the cavern. With each moment that passed, the light grew and the shadow I hid in shrank.\n\n“If you can do anything at all, now would be the time,” Peta quipped. Damn it, she was right. I focused on Ash being locked away, on Fiametta and her games . . . but it didn’t work. “Peta, help me out here.”\n\n“Cactus slept with Maggie after he kissed you,” she said.\n\nAnd there it was. A fierce hurt arched through me and I grabbed hold of the anger that flowed with it.\n\nBehind Fiametta was the stone statue of the firewyrm that epitomized their family. I focused on it, thinking about how I’d broken down the sandstone doors in the Deep, and how shocked Requiem had been. Maybe that would work here too.\n\nPressing my hands into the ground, I pushed my power through the earth toward the statue. A wave of the earth rippled out from me—“Shit, she’ll see where it came from,” I growled.\n\nFiametta seemed oblivious to the wave until it hit the statue. The large obsidian fire lizard groaned as it rocked on its base. She turned and put her hands on her hips. The two Enders flanking her turned also; this was the moment I needed. I urged my power into the stone, finding the particles and pulling them apart bit by bit. Gritting my teeth, I focused."

        "content": "In an explosion that rocked the cavern, the statue burst apart the black stone, flinging out wide enough that a few pieces even landed at my feet. I scooped one up and tucked it into a pocket, not really knowing why, but trusting my instinct. Perhaps I would need it later. Fiametta’s back was to me, but I couldn’t help but stare. “Mother goddess.”\n\n“Run, Dirt Girl. You won’t get a second chance.” Peta urged me forward, butting her head against the back of my legs. I stumbled forward, around the close corner and into Brand’s home. I jogged to my room, stopping only to grab a cloth from the bathing room. Dipping it into a basin of water, I scrubbed at my face and arms. The mixture that flowed off me was a deep black, like coal dust. “There is no way—”\n\n“Just hurry,” Peta looked over her shoulder. “They are coming faster now. She already suspects you.”\n\nGreat. I threw the wet cloth into the basin and bolted down the hall to my room. Peta slipped in as I shut the door. I stripped out of my vest and pants, dropping them onto the floor and then crawled into the bed. The silk sheets were cool on my skin and they covered the dirt on my legs, sticking to me where I was still wet. Peta curled up in the crook of my neck. “Until she commands you, do not open your eyes,” she said as I closed my eyes just as the door to my room slammed open.\n\nEven with Peta’s warning, it was a struggle to lay relaxed, breathing slowly with my eyes closed tight.\n\n“Terraling, awake,” Fiametta commanded and I slowly opened my eyes. Blinking up at her, it was no effort to yawn.\n\n“What’s going on?” I whispered, sitting up and clutching the sheet to my chest.\n\nFiametta’s eyes narrowed as she took a step closer. Once more I thought for just a split second I saw a glimmer of pink at the edges of her eyes. But it was gone before I could say for sure.\n\n“How is it that your skin is damp?” Her words snapped me out of my musing.\n\nI frowned and then gave a slow shrug, thinking fast. “Sweating, I guess. It is far hotter here than I’m used to at the Rim.”\n\nI didn’t think her eyes could narrow more, but I was wrong. Her eyebrows dipped as her two Enders slipped into the room. I held up my hands, allowing the sheet to drop, baring my chest. “I am unarmed.”\n\n“I doubt that, as I doubt very much that you have been here all night. How did you keep awake when the bell tolled?” she said quietly, the tone of her voice anything but soft. Worm shit and green sticks, if she didn’t believe me, there was nothing I could say to sway her.\n\nPeta leapt to the floor, stretching. “My queen, the Dirt Girl has been here all night and I have slept beside her. What you are suggesting would imply that she has some sort of strength against our magic.”\n\nFiametta’s eyes flicked between Peta and me. She bent and scooped the cat up and I stiffened, feeling like she was touching something of mine that I hadn’t given her permission to.\n\nThe queen held Peta up to her face. “And why should I believe you, bad luck cat?”\n\n“Because my heart is here in the Pit, no matter where I am assigned by the mother goddess.” There was a deep sincerity in her words and for some strange reason a slice of pain cut through me.\n\nFiametta sniffed. “We shall see.” She lowered Peta to the ground gently. “Terraling, come with us. It is time for you to see your friend for the last time.”\n\nI grabbed at the sheets to keep from leaping out of the bed and showing all the dirt on my legs. “You said three days, today is only the second day.”\n\nAn arch of her eyebrow and the Enders shifted on their feet. “And if I chose to kill him now, I would be within my rights.”\n\nI swallowed hard. “Is that what you’ve decided?” What would I do if she said yes? Try and raze the Pit? Take Ash out by force?\n\nI would start a war between our families, a war the world could not afford; even I knew that much.\n\n“No.”\n\nThat one word and I deflated. “Thank the mother goddess.”\n\n“Do not thank her yet.” Fiametta’s words bit at me. “Neither of you are safe. You may not be in the dungeon, you may have tried to save me from treachery, but I do not trust you. Nor will I. I feel you trying to worm your way into my good graces.”\n\nI couldn’t stop my eyes from widening as she spun and strode out of my room. Her Enders followed silently. I rolled out of bed and jerked my still warm clothes back on.\n\nWhat had Fiametta meant by that? Worming my way into her good graces, how was I supposed to be doing that?\n\nPeta meowed at me and patted my knee with one paw. “Pick me up, Dirt Girl.”\n\nI bent and did as she asked and she curled onto my shoulder with a sigh that was one part relief and two parts pain.\n\nMy feet stopped in the threshold of my room, shock rolling through me as I sensed the pain deep in Peta’s ribs. “Peta, did she hurt you?”\n\n“It is her way with familiars, to get them to be honest.” Her breathing was ragged and under my hands, several of her ribs felt lumpy, and out of place. The rage that lit along my nerve endings was sudden and sharp. That was the slice of pain I’d felt when Fiametta had picked up Peta. I strode out the door and through the house, fueled by anger.\n\nFiametta stood waiting with her arms crossed and I didn’t slow. I all but slammed my face into hers, using my body to push her back. “If you touch my familiar again—ever—I will pull this mountain down on your head. Do you understand?”\n\nPeta let out a whimper and hid her face behind my neck, but I never took my eyes from Fiametta. The two Enders swept in as I spoke, but she lifted a hand, stopping them. Her eyes were carefully neutral."

        "content": "“She is a creature of the Pit and therefore mine to rule.”\n\nI pushed her back another step with my body, staring down at her. “She is a creation of the mother goddess gifted to me. She is mine, Fiametta. Do not forget that.”\n\nAround us the mountain rumbled and the red lines of power worked up Fiametta’s arms to her shoulders. “You wish to fight me, Terraling? You will lose.”\n\n“Do not be so sure,” I snapped, seeing for the first time the colors racing up my own arms. A deep vibrant green with hints of pink peeking through, boosting the darker color. “You may be queen, but you are blind. You have someone trying to take you down and you are so sure of yourself, you think you can stand against it on your own.”\n\nHer blue eyes widened. “I have killed the traitor.”\n\nI took a step back and shook my head. “You think he worked alone? He said he had a master other than you. And then there are the firewyrms. You would wipe them out as if they were nothing.”\n\n“What do you know of the firewyrms?” She leaned toward me.\n\n“I know they were being manipulated into attacking you. Making you believe they were the true threat.”\n\nHer eyes turned thoughtful. She raised her left hand and beckoned to the Ender on that side. “What say you?”\n\nHe bowed his head. “No one here rivals you, my queen. You reign supreme and will for a thousand years.”\n\nA second wave of her hand and both Enders stepped back, far enough that they could no longer overhear us.\n\nThe Ender’s words had a feeling of something he’d said before; something he did by rote with no real feeling behind them.\n\nFiametta snorted. “That,” she pointed at her Ender, “is why I have not killed you, Larkspur. You do not back down from me and while you irritate my skin just looking at you . . .I cannot deny you speak your mind and with it a truth I have not heard in a long time. It is an interesting theory you have regarding the firewyrms. Interesting indeed.”\n\nShe lifted a hand toward Peta and I shifted my weight so the shoulder my cat sat on was away from Fiametta. The queen dropped her hand. “Come, see your friend. We will speak after of things that should not be heard by mere Enders.”\n\nSpinning on her booted heel, she walked away. Her long red hair swayed against the black leathers she wore as she walked . . . but the boots caught my attention.\n\nFollowing slowly, I reached up and ran my hands carefully over Peta’s back. “Why is the queen wearing boots? Why would she be afraid of her feet touching the ground or the heat? Shouldn’t that be part of her connection to her element?”\n\nI could understand why the Enders wore boots, they were useful when kicking the crap out of someone, but not the queen.\n\nPeta gave a low shudder and she struggled to breathe around her words. “That is a good question.”\n\nI stopped and stared at her. “How badly are you hurt?”\n\n“I will heal.” Her eyes were at half-mast and her third eyelid dropped across her green irises. She struggled for breath as her tiny pink tongue hung out, and she wobbled on my shoulder.\n\n“Fiametta, we must stop at the healer’s first.”\n\nThe queen never slowed for a beat. “I will not. You have a few moments before everyone in my kingdom will waken. This is your last chance to see your friend.”\n\nPeta panted in my ear. “She will not give you another opportunity.”\n\nGrowling to myself, I stalked after Fiametta, wishing I could break a few of her ribs and see how she liked it.\n\nPeta laid her head on my shoulder and a pitiful purr rolled out of her, a raspy wet rumble that did not sound right. Jaw tight, I did my best not to jar or jostle her. Because maybe she wasn’t all that enamored with being my familiar, but she was mine to protect and care for as much as I was hers.\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nThe dungeons were not deep in the mountain as I expected, but to the side of the main throne room on the upper levels. The entrance was directly behind the gold and jewel encrusted throne.\n\nBefore I could ask, Fiametta pointed at the plain doors. “It is best to keep your enemies close, Terraling. If you ever find yourself protecting a royal in the Rim, that is advice I suggest you heed.”\n\n“Is that why you slept with the traitor?” The words popped out before I could catch them and I swallowed hard. Peta let out a low groan as the queen slowly turned.\n\nHer blue eyes sparkled, and shocked, I realized she tried not to laugh. Her lips twitched and her shoulders tightened as she fought not to shake. Flicking her fingers at the two Enders, she turned and walked to the flat section of the wall that was the prison entrance. “Larkspur, you are bold like no one I have met in a long time. It is refreshing. I did not know he was a traitor. But if I had, I likely would have still bedded him. He had a very fine body.”\n\nI opened my mouth, but then closed it quickly as I thought better of my words. Fiametta turned and lifted an eyebrow.\n\n“What, now you would censor yourself?” she asked.\n\n“I believe if I cross a line you do not like, and I cannot see, you will use that as a reason to throw me into the dungeon beside Ash.” I folded my arms over my chest while I waited for her to either open the door or step out of my way.\n\nShe shrugged. “Possibly, yes.”\n\n“Don’t do it, Dirt Girl,” Peta said at the same time as I spoke.\n\n“And Cassava? Did you know what she was doing or did you realize too late that she was trying to manipulate you?”\n\nFiametta stared at me, her expression unreadable. “Cassava and I were friends once. Her machinations are what made me break ties with her. Basileus should have banished her when she killed his mistress. That one could have made your family great if she could have ousted Cassava.”"

        "content": "Her words shocked me to the core. Fiametta spoke about my mother, Ulani. But Fiametta didn’t know I was the bastard child of the king and I wanted to keep it that way. Swallowing the words I truly wanted to say, I kept it simple, my tone casual.\n\n“So I hear.” I didn’t move from where I was. Anything I did now could be considered a threat. Fiametta walked toward me, circling me, her boot heels clicking against the smooth floor.\n\n“What else do you hear? Tell me the truth, Larkspur, and perhaps we can discuss your—and your friend’s—usefulness to me.”\n\nShe was behind me and I struggled not to turn to her. I did not want the queen at my back and my shoulder blades itched as though she’d pressed a knife there. I chose my words carefully while still speaking the truth.\n\n“Cassava had a way of controlling people—it is why the king banished her.”\n\nFiametta snorted as she came around my right side. “Your king has been under her spell for years. You think he’s broken free because she is gone?”\n\nHere it was, the stab in the dark. “Her ability to control people is gone.”\n\nHer eyebrows shot up and she stopped in front of me. “Truly?”\n\nI nodded. “At least, her ability outside of her natural charms.”\n\n“Interesting.” She turned and walked toward the dungeon again. “Come, see your friend before I kill him.”\n\n“Wait, you said—”\n\n“You told me nothing I didn’t already know. Cassava came to me first after she was banished. I sent her away with ease which told me she could no longer manipulate me as she once had.”\n\nShe flung the doors open and gestured. “You have five minutes. If you are not out in that time frame, I will shut the door and lock you in.”\n\nI strode through, not for a second doubting her words. “Peta, count for me. Give me a ten second warning.”\n\n“Done,” she said softly.\n\nThe gloom of the dungeon hung like steam in the air, moist and hot. The poor air quality not only made it hard to breathe, but hard to see.\n\n“Ash?”\n\n“Lark.” His voice came from my left and I followed it unerringly. He was chained to the wall, his hands above his head and his legs spread wide. They’d stripped him down to nothing more than his small clothes. I stopped a couple feet from him.\n\n“Are you hurt?”\n\n“I’ve healed.”\n\n“Who did you fight with?”\n\nHe shook his head. “I don’t even know. He was all dressed in black and I couldn’t get a good look at him. I assumed he was another prisoner. He attacked me, and I fought back. I don’t think he was expecting that.”\n\nThe cloaked one. “He is no prisoner. He’s fighting everything I’m doing to get you out.”\n\n“You can’t get me out, Lark. They have a steel trap of a case. Brand should have had you out of here by now.”\n\nI leaned in and smacked him in the chest. “I’m not leaving without you. We’re a team, we survived the Deep together, and we will damn well survive this.”\n\nA breath eased out of him. “There is nothing you can do, Lark. They have to blame someone for the deaths.”\n\n“Except that the Enders didn’t die because of the wounds inflicted. They died afterward, something, or someone else killed them, Ash. I had paperwork that proved it—”\n\n“Let me guess, the paperwork is missing?”\n\nMy whole body seemed to freeze despite the heat and humidity. “Yes, but how could you know that?”\n\n“That is the way cases like this go. The minute you have hope it is snatched away and dashed. Let it go, Lark. I am here, willingly. The more you try to get me out, the more trouble you will find. We both know that.”\n\nHe shook his head and I noticed his hair was dull with grime already, dimming the bright blond strands. He dropped his eyes and I felt his words like grease along my soul.\n\n“No, that isn’t going to fly, Ash. Stop lying to me. You don’t really believe that.”\n\nHis head snapped up and his mouth dropped which only confirmed the feeling. “How can you even know that?”\n\n“Because she carries Spirit, you dumb dirt boy,” Peta snapped and she carefully adjusted herself on my shoulders. “She’s as loyal as they come and I would think you should be grateful someone is trying to free you.”\n\nHis lips tightened and he shook his head. “Lark, this is goodbye. You can’t save me and I . . . I want you to stop trying. This is my penance for losing your mother and Bram. They died on my watch.”\n\nI put my hands on my hips and glared at him. “Really? This bullshit again? Yes, they died. Yes, you should have stopped Cassava and her Sylphs from doing what they did.” Peta sucked in a sharp breath that made her cough, but I kept going. “But the reality is you were as controlled as I was. As my father was—that is nothing we can change now or then. And now when I need you most, you would sacrifice your life for me which is all well and good, but what happens the next time?”\n\nHe frowned, “What do you mean the next time?”\n\nBlowing out an exasperated sigh I threw my hands into the air. “You think this is the last time I’m going to be in trouble? It seems to be my middle name. The mother goddess has chosen me for something and I know I can’t do it alone. Whatever it is. I have Peta now,” I reached up and touched her head, “but I need you, too.”\n\nHis golden eyes searched my face. “Lark.”"

        "content": "“Ash, ask for a trial. It will slow things and give me time.” I tipped my head to the side.\n\n“You can’t do that,” Peta said, “he didn’t ask for one in the beginning. He can’t go back now.”\n\nDamn the Salamanders and their rules.\n\nI started to back up. “I’m not giving up, Ash. “\n\nThe smile that flickered on his lips was all I needed. I stepped forward, cupped his face and kissed him. The heat between our mouths shot straight through me, warming me like nothing in the Pit had, not even the heat of the lava compared. I felt a need in him as our lips pressed against each other, as strong as there was a need in me to be assured we were together in this chaotic world. That even when everything else went to hell, we had each other.\n\nI found myself clinging to him. No matter what happened, I couldn’t lose him. I pulled back a little and rested my forehead against his as I caught my breath and my heart raced.\n\n“For luck,” I said.\n\n“I doubt you will need luck,” he whispered against my mouth.\n\nPeta cleared her throat. “We must leave now.”\n\nI stepped back from Ash, spun and jogged out of the dungeon, trying not to think about that toe-curling kiss and the depth of emotion in it. I slipped through the doors as Fiametta’s two Enders shut them.\n\nBut the queen was nowhere to be seen. I glanced around the room. “Looks like our conversation is done.”\n\nThe Enders said nothing but I noticed they glared as they walked away. I couldn’t resist. I lifted my hand and waved. “Say hello to Maggie for me.”\n\nThe one on the left, the one who’d answered Fiametta’s question stopped moving and his buddy smacked him on the arm. “Let it go. The queen will fry her ass before the week is out. You know that.”\n\nHe grunted, put all four fingers to his neck and slid them across. “You’re dead, Terraling. You will not see the start of the new moon.”\n\nI shrugged as if his words didn’t bother me. “Fiametta is not the first ruler to threaten me. The funny thing is, I’m still here, and those who threatened me . . . not so much.”\n\nThe Enders spun away and I stood, breathing hard. “You think they were telling the truth? Do you think Fiametta is playing me?”\n\n“What do your instincts tell you?”\n\nI drew in a slow breath as if tasting the air around us. “That nothing is as it seems here, any more than the Deep showed us its true colors until the very end. And that makes me nervous.”\n\nThere was no way I could prove the Enders didn’t die as a result of my weapons without the paperwork the cloaked one stole from me. No way I could show someone else ended their lives.\n\nBut how was I going to get Ash out? I paced the throne room, fatigue from the long night slowly creeping over me but I refused to give in. I had very little time to prove Ash was innocent.\n\nEverything here in the Pit was about rules. . . that might be the answer I was looking for.\n\nI stopped in the middle of the room. “The rules here are strict, Peta. And everyone follows them to the letter. Is there a place, like a library where I can look for maybe a loophole? Some way we can get Ash out?”\n\nShe shook her head hard enough that I thought she would fall off my shoulder. “No libraries here.”\n\nThe lie was heavy between us and her eyes met mine. She blinked slowly several times. “I think we should go see your friend Cactus. He has some plants I’d like to taste.”\n\nIt took me a good twenty seconds to realize she was afraid to talk here, so close to the queen’s quarters.\n\nSo close to the place we’d be tossed and forgotten about if we stepped out of line.\n\n“Fine, let’s get you some greenery, you nutty cat.”\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nPeta pointed out where I was to turn at each intersection and not once did we run into anyone. It took my sleep-deprived brain the whole walk to figure out something was not quite right. “How long before Fiametta wakes everyone else?”\n\n“They should be awake by now,” Peta said, “all the sconces are lit. I don’t know why no one else is up. This has been happening more and more. Sleep is hanging onto people instead of leaving when it should.”\n\nOdd, but not necessarily bad. It meant I didn’t have to explain to anyone what I was doing without a guide deep within the tunnels. Even with Peta on my shoulder I had no doubt I’d be stopped and dragged to the queen.\n\nAgain.\n\nI stumbled over my own feet, my limbs dragging with fatigue. Peta gave a soft chirping noise. “We’re almost there.”\n\nA few more steps, one last corner and we were in the main living area cavern. Daylight streamed through the light tubes and I guessed we were on our way to mid-morning. But still no one walked about, no children laughing and playing, no women doing laundry or cleaning.\n\nA shiver ran down the length of my spine and I stopped and stared across the cavern. The only noise was of the bubbling lava river as it flowed in its winding curve.\n\nI forced myself into a jog, my long legs eating up the distance between the bridge and us. While I didn’t want to jostle Peta, I also didn’t want to dawdle. Around us I felt the air tensing, like the very breath in the caves was being held; waiting for something inevitable to happen.\n\nI really didn’t want to find out what that event was going to be. Unfortunately for me, I was not to be so lucky.\n\nWhen standing in the middle of the bridge, the structure groaned and Peta gasped. I didn’t wait to see what the hell was going on but leapt for all I was worth for the far side."

        "content": "Underneath me the bridge exploded, stones smashing into me as I flew through the air. Arms outstretched, the heat of the lava licked along the front of my body as I sailed toward land. We hit the edge of the river with a hard thump and I scrambled up the slight incline while the rocks dropped into the lava behind me, splashing and sending out droplets of red death.\n\nWhatever fatigue I had was gone as I sprinted from the lava flow, my ears ringing with what had almost been the end of me. And no one would have known. Cactus and Ash would think I’d just abandoned them.\n\nI finally stopped when Peta bit my ear and growled. “Dirt Girl, you’re running the wrong way.”\n\nBreathing hard, I realized just how terrified I was—the very thought of falling into the lava drove logic from my mind. “I would face the Deep and its monsters a hundred times again before this,” I spit out. The urge to keep running, to bolt until I found a way out of this nightmare labyrinth was overwhelming and I struggled to tamp it down.\n\n“Dirt Girl, you will not go into the lava. I will not allow that to happen.” Peta’s words slowed my racing heart and I nodded.\n\nOnly then was I able to take in the scene. Exploding rocks and no warning—only one conclusion could be drawn. “That was no accident.”\n\n“I did not think so either. But who other than yourself can manipulate stone?”\n\n“The smaller cloaked one.” I stared around the cavern, looking for a black figure darting away, but saw nothing. That didn’t mean I was wrong though.\n\n“Cactus is capable. You must also think of him,” Peta said and I hated that she was right.\n\nHe was a powerhouse in his own right. He’d broken the archway with such ease to stop the traitor from escaping.\n\n“He could be helping her, and using our old ties to draw close to me.”\n\nI didn’t have to say Fiametta’s name. We both knew whom I meant. Peta bobbed her head. “True, but even though I suggested him, he doesn’t seem the type. Do you truly believe you can’t trust him?”\n\nGetting my legs going again, I tossed the thoughts around in my head. “I don’t know, Peta. That’s the problem. Those who have been closest to me have shown they are rarely what they appear.”\n\nPeta cleared her tiny throat and whispered into my ear. “My first charge, the one who carried Spirit was able to see inside other people’s minds when he touched them. Perhaps you could do that with Cactus so you could be sure of his loyalty?”\n\nI sucked in a slow breath. I’d done something similar when I’d been in the Deep. Though it had been an accident, I’d touched a shape shifter’s head and heard his thoughts and what he planned on doing to me.\n\nWe were outside Cactus’s home and I stopped in the doorway. I was totally stalling because I didn’t know what to do, where to take this. I didn’t want to believe Cactus could hurt me, and even as I thought it, the doubts faded. Yet I couldn’t rule him out.\n\nCarefully I took Peta from my shoulder and set her down. She limped through the door.\n\n“You have a choice, depending on how much you trust the half breed.”\n\nShe was right. I followed her into Cactus’s home. The plants bent toward me and I brushed my face over the open hibiscus flowers, the soft petals a caress on my skin.\n\n“How did it go with the queen?” Cactus broke the moment, startling me. I jumped, feeling as though my disloyal thoughts were written all over my face. I glanced at him.\n\n“About as well as one could hope. Have you been here waiting the whole time?” I watched his eyes for a flicker, a sign of deception. He nodded and a half grin tipped his lips.\n\n“Yeah, which sucks because Maggie is in the back snoring and farting up a storm. You know, Salamanders spend so much time in the lava that they begin to produce a kind of noxious sulfur of their own?” As he spoke he closed the distance between us, putting his arms around my waist and his chin on my shoulder. He drew in a slow, deep breath.\n\n“And what do I smell like?”\n\nHis laugh rumbled across his chest to me. “Spring in the Rim, a little slice of heaven in my arms.” He turned his head and I stepped back so his lips missed my neck.\n\n“I need to speak to Peta, do you have another room away from Maggie?” I asked, folding my arms over my chest.\n\nHis eyebrows climbed. “Don’t tell me you think Maggie and me—”\n\n“You do whatever you want, prick,” Peta snapped. “I need to speak with my charge alone.”\n\nCactus laughed softly. “Maybe you will make her a good familiar, bad luck cat. At least you’re loyal.”\n\nPeta gave a long low hiss and the fur along her spine stood at attention. I bent and scooped her up even though she’d just asked to be put down. “A room, Cactus.”\n\nHe gestured to the left and a doorway I hadn’t noticed before opened. “Lark, you know me. Maggie isn’t my type in the least.”\n\nI nodded, feeling a weight around my heart lift. “I know, Cactus. Still, it looked bad.” Stopping in the doorway, I looked at him and placed a hand on his chest when he would follow me. “Peta, this is your call.”\n\nHer body trembled, but I didn’t look down at her. The seconds ticked by, almost audibly as we waited for her answer. A sigh slipped out of her. “If you trust him, then I will too. He may hear what I have to say.”\n\nAnd even though I’d doubted for a moment, I did trust Cactus. He was my friend.\n\nCactus grinned and I turned my back on him, entering the smaller room. I struggled not to gasp at what I saw."

        "content": "Four tiny redwoods were planted in the hard ground; they couldn’t have been more than a few years old as they barely reached the ceiling. Without a second though, I reached out and touched one, my hand aching for the feel of home after so much time in the Deep, and now, trapped in the Pit.\n\nThis is what Banishment would be like. To always be aching for a place that speaks to your soul, yet never able to hold it in your hands or heart again. The thought came unbidden to my mind and I closed my eyes against the sudden blur of tears.\n\nBanishment was what every elemental feared, that they would be cast out of their home, doomed to wander the world until they faded to nothing, their souls and very beings starved of the connections that made them who they were. “Cactus, how is it you’ve survived this long outside the Rim?” I whispered as I pressed my head against the tree. Its soul was young, and very old at the same time. The history of its species called to me from the long distant past, the wisdom they held in their collective memory if I could just understand the words whispered around me.\n\n“The fire is a part of me too, Lark. As long as I have some of the earth near me like this, I can do it. But . . . I can’t stay here any longer. There is more of me that is of the earth than fire.”\n\nI opened my eyes to see him mimicking me, his hands and forehead pressed against the tree to my right.\n\nPeta let out a small sigh. “Then we must all escape. And soon. I feel a firestorm coming, and none of us will want to be here for that.”\n\nHer words brought me back to the moment, breaking the spell the trees cast over me, calling me home.\n\n“Where do we go first, Peta? You know the Pit, where do I go for answers?”\n\nShe shifted her weight and dropped her head to my ear. “There is a secret place that Loam would go. A place only a few knew about and they are all dead and gone now. A place of old rules that even the queen can’t deny.”\n\nA shiver ran through my spine. I looked to Cactus. “Do you know what she’s talking about?”\n\nHe frowned. “Whispers of rumors. Stories of a place that tells our history and everything that has ever happened in the elemental world. That would be a huge library though and even here, hard to hide.”\n\nPeta shook her head a single time. “No, this place is very small. It is where all the original edicts of the Pit were created. Loam knew about it. He had to as an ambassador. And of course, the queen knows, but she doesn’t know where it is.”\n\n“But Loam did?” I needed to be very certain because if Peta was wrong, I knew there was only one thing I could do to save Ash. Something he would fight me on every step of the way, so I held it as a last resort. A final gamble if I found no other way.\n\nForcing my feet to move, I stepped away from the trees and out of the room. “Peta, take us there.”\n\n“Now?” Her strangled squawk was all I needed to hear to know just how dangerous this was going to be.\n\n“Yes. Now.”\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nAs we walked, I held Peta in my arms. I felt the struggle of her body with each breath she took, her broken ribs at a bad angle pressed against her lungs.\n\n“That’s why I can’t shift right now,” she said softly. “A shift when I’m so injured would surely puncture my air bags and I would be of no use.”\n\nI stroked a hand along her back as I followed Cactus through the currently well-lit tunnels. Empty tunnels.\n\n“Cactus, stop a minute.” I laid my hand on Peta’s back, and spoke quietly to her. “We’re connected, aren’t we?”\n\nHer green eyes narrowed. “We are.”\n\n“And I can draw energy from you, if I need to be healed?”\n\nShe slowly nodded. “Yes.”\n\nI closed my eyes. “Then let’s reverse the flow.” I found the bundle of emotions, the connection to Peta inside my head, right next to the place that my power with Spirit resided. Distantly I heard her saying it didn’t work that way, that I couldn’t heal her but I couldn’t see why not. It made sense that it—the connection between us—would work both ways.\n\nTaking hold of my Spirit power and the bond to Peta I threaded them together inside my head. The strands around Peta’s energy glowed a bright pink, like a sun flare, and then faded into nothing. Peta let out a gasp and I swayed where I stood.\n\nA dip in my energy was all I felt, but when I opened my eyes Peta glared up at me. “Stupid Dirt Girl! You aren’t supposed to sacrifice your life for me, it’s supposed to be the other way around!”\n\nI shrugged and she leapt from my arms, immediately shifting to her snow leopard form.\n\nHer emotions were all over the map, swinging from an intense dislike that came from years of being told Terralings were stupid and useless, to an intense loyalty that bordered on love.\n\nConfusion I understood. So I gave her an out. A way to not feel like she was being a burden. “I can’t have you slowing us down,” I said, brushing off my shirt.\n\nHer back stiffened. “I would not have slowed you down.”\n\nI looked to Cactus who gave me a wink as he patted her at the base of her tail, the equivalent of an ass pat on a woman. “Yeah, you were, kitten.”\n\n“Kitten?” She spluttered the word and I moved between them before he could make it worse. The last thing I needed was her lashing out at him. Even if he did kinda deserve it.\n\n“Peta, just lead the way, please. I’ll talk to Cactus.”\n\nHer long tail sliced through the air, side to side, actually hitting the wall, but she did as I asked."

        "content": "Cactus settled in beside me and he opened his mouth but I beat him to it.\n\n“Why is no one else awake yet?”\n\nHis eyes widened. “Shit.”\n\n“Yeah, that’s what I’m thinking.”\n\nPeta glanced back at us. “This isn’t the first time it’s happened. Eighty years ago, the queen’s father kept everyone in a subdued sleep while he hunted a threat to the throne.”\n\nMy mouth dropped open. “That’s what Fiametta’s doing. I told her there was more than one threat, that her lover Coal was answering to someone.”\n\nCactus stopped at the next intersection. “I have to go to her then.”\n\n“What, why?” I stopped with him and Peta turned.\n\n“I’m one of her enforcers, Lark. Not an Ender. I’m just brought out as a threat. She may be a hard ass, but she is still my queen. She needs to be protected.” He leaned in to kiss me and I turned my face so he only caught my cheek with his lips.\n\n“You aren’t making any sense. Cactus, if she sees you’re awake when she put you to sleep with everyone else, what do you think she’s going to say? Thanks for waking up on your own to protect me?”\n\nPeta snorted. “More like, ‘Ah, so here is my traitor. I’ll just kill him and be done with it. No one will miss him.’”\n\nCactus paled. “Shit.”\n\n“You keep saying that.”\n\nPeta brushed against my thigh, her fur warm under my hand. I threaded my fingers through her long fur.\n\n“Cactus, we can’t wait. Either you’re with me, or you want to risk the queen’s suspicion that you’re one of the traitors.”\n\nHis jaw was tight, but he nodded. “Damn, there is no choice for me, is there?”\n\nPeta shook her head. “No, there isn’t. As is often the way with life.”\n\nThere was no more discussion after that. Peta trotted in front of us and we jogged to keep up. She wove her way through the maze of hallways until she reached a dead end. A fountain of bubbling water stood in front of us, steam rising from the tiny pool. The fountain itself was made of hardened lava and shaped like a snarling tiger. The water poured out of the tiger’s mouth into the pond it stood in.\n\n“The water is boiled as it comes through the tiger,” Peta said.\n\n“Should have it pour out its ass,” I muttered. My only experience with a tiger was one that Maggie sent after me. So maybe I was more than a little prejudiced against that particular big cat.\n\nPeta sniffed. “Yes, that would be fitting for a tiger, blowing smoke out its asshole.”\n\nCactus burst out laughing and then slapped his hand over his mouth as he winked. “Sorry.” Obviously not that sorry.\n\nIgnoring him, I approached the fountain. “Peta, this is a dead end.”\n\n“No, it’s not.” She dipped her face until her whiskers touched the boiling water. “You must reach in to find the thing to press. I don’t know what it is, Loam never told me. But he would reach in here, and something would click and then the wall behind us would open.”\n\nHer eyes lifted to mine. “This is why I’m angry you healed me, Dirt Girl. You need your strength for this.”\n\nCactus stepped forward. “I’ll do it. I can hold the heat at bay a little.”\n\nPeta shook her head. “No, you can’t. That is what everyone thinks but the heat is a part of the water. Only a water elemental could truly pass this without injury.”\n\n“That doesn’t make sense,” I said. “Why would you want an Undine to be the only one to escape injury?”\n\nPeta shrugged. “I didn’t make the rules.”\n\nI put a hand on Cactus’s arm. “I’ll try first, if I can’t find the latch, you can try.”\n\nHis jaw ticked but he didn’t argue. We all knew our time was limited at best; no, that wasn’t true. Ash’s time was what was running out.\n\nTaking a deep breath, I wiggled the fingers on my left hand. No point in damaging my dominant hand if I didn’t have to. “How deep, Peta?”\n\n“To your elbow at least, based on what I saw Loam do.”\n\n“Shit,” I whispered. “Cactus, stand by the wall. When the door opens, hold it if you have to,” then before I could stall any longer, I plunged my hand and forearm into the water.\n\nThe sensation was just like that of being tested by the mother goddess. My skin scorched instantly and I whimpered as I forced more of my hand in until I felt the slight bump of something under my hand. I jammed it hard and yanked my arm out. But the boiling water had done its damage. My hand and arm were bright red, and tiny boils broke out. I held my arm out from my body and waved it in the air, which only made the blood pulse stronger.\n\n“Draw on me, Dirt Girl. Loam did, I know the pain will be temporary,” Peta said.\n\nGritting my teeth, I nodded. The pain was excruciating, and I knew now why the pool was set up that only an Undine could pass it easily. They didn’t like coming to the Pit in the first place so the likelihood of them finding this hidden place was small. But more than that, there was no way I could hide the injury from the queen. I had no doubt that was the reason behind the boiling water. How could you hide where you’d been?\n\nThe simple answer was—you couldn’t.\n\nPeta’s energy flowed through me and I drank it down, like a bucket of ice water poured over my skin, as though her heritage in the mountains flowed through her veins into mine. The burn faded and I let go of Peta’s energy as soon as the pain was tolerable."

        "content": "Peta pushed herself against me. “Fiametta will know, you should take more from me.”\n\n“I’ll wear a long shirt,” I said. “I can’t take all your strength, Peta. I need you. And I don’t like causing you pain. How often did Loam come here?”\n\n“Daily.” Her green eyes glittered with what I thought might have been tears, but she looked away before I could be sure.\n\n“Ladies,” Cactus said and we both turned. He stood in a doorway that hadn’t been there only moments before.\n\nPeta and I jogged forward and slipped through the door into the semi darkness. Cactus let go of the edge of the door and the panel behind us slid shut. A bloom of fire lit over Cactus’s hand. He moved forward and lit torches ensconced in the walls. The tiny place lit up as though we had noonday sun beating down on our heads. Bright shiny reflective panels covered the ceiling, picking up light and throwing it around with abandon.\n\nThe walls were lined with books and scrolls and the place felt . . .old. Not that it was dusty, in fact it was remarkably clean. Twenty by twenty feet across, it was by no means a large room. But there was history here, like it was the first place the mountain had given up to be used by an elemental. The age of the place seemed to settle in my lungs as I breathed, the feel of the past becoming a part of my body.\n\nI walked to the far side of the room and put a hand on the spine of the first book that stood out. “The Divining of Souls,” I said and dropped my hand. “Not quite what we’re looking for.”\n\nPeta nosed the books near her. “These are about controlling lava at the highest level.”\n\nWe skimmed the books, looking for something that would lead in the right direction. I froze in front of a thick book with pale leather so light, it could almost be called pink. The color isn’t what stopped me though, but the title etched into the spine as though with a rough tipped knife.\n\nDestroying Spirit Elementals.\n\nI pulled the book from the shelf and held it in my hand. Distant cries of terror, the beating of hearts slowing, the breath of a final goodbye to those they loved.\n\nWith a hard shove I jammed it back onto the shelf. Ash’s life was on the line, I needed to keep focused on that. I could always come back for the other book.\n\nThat’s what I told myself anyway.\n\n“I think there is something here,” Cactus said, his excitement contagious. Peta and I ran to him and he held out a book at least twelve inches thick, and easily as wide. He flopped it onto the floor and opened it. The pages were so thin that the words on either side bled through and made the words difficult to read.\n\n“Are you sure?” I frowned. A not so small part of me hoped the answers were not in it. The thing was monstrous and I doubted anyone had bothered with a table of contents, or goddess forbid, an index of some sort.\n\nCactus held the book up so I could read the cover. “Elemental Law.” Damn it, that was not what I wanted to see with the time we had left.\n\nI sat beside him and started to thumb through the pages. “Look for key words like Ender or execution.”\n\nWe sat like that through most of the day, ignoring our stomachs’ demands for food or drink, ignoring the fatigue that finally caught up to me. We were halfway through the book when a bell sounded. A bell that could only mean one thing.\n\n“The day is over,” Peta said softly, yawning. “I’m sorry, Dirt Girl, your friend will die in the morning.”\n\nI skimmed the page I was on, the words blurring, but they were all I had left to stop the execution. This was the other option I’d sought, the fail safe that would allow me to stave off Ash’s execution.\n\nUnable to fight the combination of the sleep spell and my own lack of sleep, I lay on the hard floor next to Peta. Cactus curled up behind me, his body a vibrant heat that soothed my aching muscles.\n\nI clung to the two of them, knowing what I had to do when the morning came, and knowing they both would be furious with me.\n\nBut as far as I was concerned, it was the only way to save Ash, and it would buy us the time we needed. At least, I hoped it would.\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nI dreamed of fire and lava spilling over me as I screamed out my last breath, Peta’s eyes glowed as she laughed, and I sank under a wave of red death. Scar’s eyes glittered as Maggie tore him apart. “Save me,” he called out.\n\nJerking awake, I sat straight up, my heart pounding and my body covered in a fine sheet of sweat that evaporated as I slowed my breathing.\n\nBeside me, Peta in her snow leopard form purred in her sleep, obviously her dreams were not anything like mine. Then again, she wasn’t planning what I was. Cactus lay flat on his back with his hands linked over his belly, a soft smile on his face.\n\nI pushed myself to my feet and went back to the big book of Elemental Law. That last page was still there, the words as solid as they’d been the previous night. Carefully, I tore the page out, folding it and tucking it inside my vest. Turning back to my two companions, I clapped my hands together.\n\n“Come on, you two, time to wake up.”\n\nPeta yawned and stretched, sticking her butt in the air as she arched her back toward the ground. “The dawn is coming, we have to hurry if you want to say goodbye to your friend.”\n\nI nodded, but kept my thoughts to myself. The last thing I needed was Peta or Cactus trying to stop me. We woke Cactus and the three of us left the tiny library. The tiger fountain continued to bubble and boil, and I knew I would not be able to help if they had to go back into the library. “Cactus, can you get messages out of the Pit?”"

        "content": "“Probably, why?”\n\nThis was the key to my plan, if we were to all get out of the Pit alive. “I need you to contact Belladonna. Tell her we need her help as an ambassador. Can you do that right now?”\n\nHe nodded. “I don’t think she’ll get here before the execution, Lark. Not even if she Travels.”\n\n“Just go, and hurry,” I said.\n\nHis green eyes held more than a bit of suspicion as if he wondered what I was really up to. I knew because I would wonder the same thing if our roles were reversed. “Trust me, Cactus.”\n\n“I do.” This time his kiss landed square on my lips and I kissed him back. In case I was wrong and what I was about to do would cost me my life. Which was a distinct possibility.\n\nFor a split second, he held my face. “Don’t do anything stupid, Lark.”\n\n“Would I do that?”\n\n“To save someone you love, yes. You would.” Still, he let me go and I watched him as he turned at the next intersection and was gone before I could say anything else.\n\n“He knows me too well.”\n\n“What are you doing, Dirt Girl?”\n\nNow that he was gone, I decided to tell Peta, since she was stuck with me and the choice I made. “I’m going to confess.”\n\n“No!” she roared and put herself in front of me, halting my moving forward, her snow leopard form big enough to physically stop me. “I will not allow it. You and I both know those Enders were killed after they were healing. You would at most have a lashing, and yet even that would kill you here in the Pit! Your death is not deserved, Larkspur. You can’t do this.” Her voice trembled and I dropped to my knees, wrapping my arms around her thick furry neck. She pressed her mouth against my collarbone, her teeth flat against my skin chattering with her emotions. Through our bond her intention was clear. To stop me no matter what it took. I hadn’t really expected her to be so firm in her conviction.\n\n“Peta, I don’t plan to die. Belladonna will get me out of this and if I have to . . . I will fight my way out.”\n\nShe gasped against my neck and I pulled back. “I’m not like the other elementals. I won’t go down without a fight. Trust me. Please.”\n\n“You would be banished, anathema to all who met you. Your life would be over; you would be the walking dead. For what? A single life freely given in exchange for yours?” Her mouth hung open on the last word as if she couldn’t believe the words even as she said them.\n\n“No one will die, Peta.” The words sounded hollow in my own ears, and seemed to bounce off the walls followed by a low laugh, as though the words themselves mocked me.\n\nI put my hand on her. “Peta.” Just her name, and she dropped her head.\n\nHer green eyes rolled up so she could look at me. “Larkspur, please do not ask me to do this. To watch you offer up your life. You will be the thirteenth charge the mother goddess has given me. I cannot bear to watch you die, too.”\n\n“Walk with me.” I put my hip against her shoulder and she gave way. We were close enough to the throne room that even if she refused to point out the turns, I could have found my way. The large doors beckoned and behind them I heard the rumble of voices, in particular Fiametta’s husky tone.\n\n“Trust me to come out of this alive, Peta.”\n\n“That is what my first Spirit charge said right before he died trying to save a friend,” she whispered and I wasn’t sure I was supposed to hear her.\n\nI was committed though. Ash would not die.\n\nI put my hands on the door and pushed against the sparkling firewyrm etched into the solid gold. They swung open with ease and when I stepped into the throne room, all activity stopped and every eye looked to me.\n\nAsh was on his knees in front of Fiametta, his head bowed. Fiametta was dressed in her black Ender leathers and her hair was wild around her face, like a living flame, moving on unseen winds.\n\n“Terraling, I thought you were going to miss your friend’s final walk,” she said as she smiled at me.\n\nI smiled back, though it was an effort and my lips felt as if they were numb from ice. “I doubt that. Fiametta, I confess to the deaths of the four Enders and take all the consequences that will come my way as a result of this confession.” I crossed my arms and waited for a beat before I continued. “I instructed this Ender to confess in my place.”\n\nFiametta’s eyebrows climbed. “Truly? And why would he do that? You are the younger of the two, obviously less experienced as an Ender. Why would he listen to you?”\n\nI drew myself up to my full height and arched an eyebrow right back at her. “Because I am a princess of the Rim, and he is marked as my bodyguard.”\n\nThe entire room sucked in a sharp breath, including Peta at my side.\n\nAsh let out a low groan. “No, Lark, do not do this.”\n\nFiametta stalked slowly toward me, though her voice was even and without emotion. “You think you can avoid punishment because you have royal blood? If anything, you are held to a higher standard.”\n\n“Do you accept my confession and release Ash?”\n\nFiametta laughed. “No, I will not. You are a smart girl, Terraling. Very smart. You would take his place, then ask for a trial and try to find a way not to be thrown into the Pit, yes?”\n\nI held my breath and kept my mouth shut, but still, she saw through me. Damn, maybe Belladonna wouldn’t be able to help. Fighting my way out was not something I wanted to do, but I would if I had to.\n\nNodding she smiled again. There wasn’t a drop of condescension in her. “You will not take his place, though I commend you for trying to save your friend. Very admirable.”"

I read it out loud. “It is my right as a royal of the Rim to take his place and his punishment in his stead. By law.”\n\nFiametta reached out and carefully took the paper from me. Her blue eyes darted as she skimmed the page. “Where did you get this?”\n\n“It does not matter. This is law, regardless what family I would stand in.”\n\nFiametta lifted one hand and the lines of red flowed up her arms as she called on her element. Before she could burn the paper, I snatched it away.\n\nHer eyes bugged out and the struggle on her face was momentary. “Come with me. Now. The rest of you wait here.”\n\nShe spun on her heel and I followed her out of sheer curiosity if nothing else. Why hadn’t she just allowed us to switch places?\n\nFiametta led me to her personal chamber, and when Peta moved as if to follow me in, the queen stopped her. “This is not for you, familiar. I see your hand in this; you took her to the library, giving her access that only Loam had.” She pointed at the paper I still clutched.\n\nPeta tipped her head to one side. “You are not my queen any longer, Fiametta. I obey Larkspur, no one else.”\n\nFiametta’s hands clutched at her side, the only indicator that Peta’s words affected her at all.\n\nI put a hand on Peta’s head. “Wait for me. Please.”\n\nPeta nodded and sat on her haunches. “I will come if you call.”\n\nFiametta swept into her room and again, I followed. The door slammed behind me seemingly of its own volition.\n\n“You are going to get us all killed, you idiot,” the queen snapped at me, all pretenses apparently dropped.\n\n“Actually, I’m doing my best to get my people out of here.”\n\nHer eyes narrowed. “Do you not wonder why there are so few Salamanders awake? Has it not crossed your mind that perhaps your friend’s life is a miniscule drop in the scheme of things?”\n\nHow in the goddess’s name was I supposed to know any of that? “Why did you bring me here?”\n\nShe began to pace, her power zipping along her arms and over her body as her agitation increased. “There are at least two more traitors within my home, Terraling. You found one, I want you to find these other two. If I have you in chains, I can hardly use you to ferret them out. And if you don’t manage that . . . those threatening me and my people have made it very clear they will wipe us all out. You and your friends included.”\n\nThis was not what I expected but I would use it to my advantage.\n\n“And if I do? Will you let Ash go?”\n\n“No.”\n\nI burst out laughing; I couldn’t help it. “That doesn’t make me want to help you at all. If Ash will die either way, what does it matter to me if you survive your traitors?”\n\nPausing by the bed, she stroked the sheet with one hand and flames licked along it, but didn’t burn it. “The traitor has been leaving me notes, breaking into my room and taunting me while I sleep.”\n\nA shiver ran through me. “As bad as that is, it has nothing to do with me.”\n\n“That’s what you think.” Her eyes lifted to mine. “His words lead me to believe you are also a target seeing as he is encouraging me to wipe out the three Terralings in the Pit. You, Ash, and my Cactus.”\n\nI swallowed hard. “Charge me with the deaths of the Enders, and allow me to go on trial. That gives me a reason to be in the Pit longer.”\n\n“No.”\n\nAnger sliced through what was left of my reason and I took hold of the power of the earth running through me. I softened the ground under her feet and sunk her to her neck in a split second. She gasped and stared up at me. “You would dare attack me?”\n\nI crouched in front of her. “I am not attacking you, Fiametta. I am stopping you from doing something foolish. If I must, I will fight my way out of the Pit. Do you understand? I will pull this wyrm-ridden mountain down on your head. I will keep those who are mine safe, no matter the cost.”\n\nStanding, my heart beat with fear as much as anger. I knew I was playing a dangerous game. “Do you think the traitor will leave you alive if I don’t let you go and he finds you imprisoned like this tonight?”\n\n“My Enders will—”\n\n“They will do nothing when they see a proclamation of release written on your paper.” I walked to her desk and opened the drawer, pulling out a thick piece of parchment. “Will they?”\n\n“Terraling—”\n\n“My name is Larkspur.” I corrected her as I laid down the paper and picked up the pen.\n\n“I will hunt you to the ends of the world.”\n\n“Not if one of the traitors kills you first. Which I’m banking on.” I scratched a few words on the paper as Fiametta struggled. With her arms pinned to her sides, it would take her time to blast her way out.\n\n“I will . . . negotiate.” She bit the words out and I turned to see her eyes blazing and the lines of power running along the tops of her shoulders. She was fighting to get out and failing.\n\nI swallowed hard and realized the anger had fled me and I couldn’t connect to the earth. “Worm shit.”\n\n“Let me out, Terra—Larkspur. We will negotiate when I am free.” She tipped her head back as if she could look down her nose at me while imprisoned.\n\n“Peta,” I called out, and she burst through the door a second later. Lowering her body to the floor, she crept toward Fiametta."

        "content": "“Lark, what . . .” she stood and looked at me. “What has happened?”\n\n“I need you to get Cactus. Hurry.” Peta gave a quick nod and bounded away without another question.\n\nFiametta struggled against my bonds and I felt them crack, lava pushing through the rock I’d ensconced her body in. “Terraling, if one of my people sees me like this I will kill you.”\n\nI dropped to a crouch in front of her, feeling the heat through the earth as she tried to power through the rock. I had to have a reason to call Cactus, or she would see my weakness. “Fia, can I call you Fia? There is a problem. I don’t trust you to keep to your word.” I patted her on top of the head and for just a moment I thought she might snap her teeth at me.\n\nA breath went out of her. “You are . . . not what I would expect from a princess of the Rim. Or an Ender from the Rim. Or really anyone from the Rim.”\n\n“Why? Because Cassava told you we were weak?”\n\nFiametta laughed, and I had to hand it to her. She handled things like a queen. Calm, cool, and reasonable. To a degree. Not to say I trusted her by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n“That. And I have seen your father deal with people. Even Cassava who he should have killed, yet only banished.”\n\nI swallowed hard. “Yes, I agree.”\n\nFiametta nodded at me. “Who is the heir to the Rim?”\n\nShrugging, I looked over my shoulder to the door, hoping Peta could find Cactus quickly. “I don’t know.”\n\nFiametta leaned her head back. “You are powerful enough to be the heir, yet you are not a full Terraling. You don’t have the look. So that would make you a half breed. Like Cactus.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What is your other half?”\n\nI clamped my mouth shut and shook my head.\n\nFiametta’s eyes narrowed and she stared hard at me. “No fire runs in your veins, no water either. Perhaps Sylph? You have the height for a wind walker, but not the temperament.”\n\n“I favor my father’s side,” I said softly.\n\nHer eyes didn’t waver and for just a second I met them. I didn’t want her to guess my other half, didn’t want her to know I could manipulate Spirit. And it hit me in that moment I could have forced her to agree with me.\n\n“You’ve thought of something, Larkspur.”\n\nThe door behind us creaked open and I twisted on my feet. Cactus stepped into the room, followed by Peta and . . . Brand.\n\nBrand’s eyes widened and he pulled a crossbow from his back, had the bolt set and aimed at me before I could even stand. “Terraling, you go too far.”\n\nI slowly held my hands up. “She and I are negotiating. As two royals houses do from time to time.”\n\nFiametta snorted. “Shoot her, Brand.”\n\nHis finger hovered over the trigger and I tensed. “If I move when you shoot, you will hit your queen.”\n\nBrand wavered, his bow dipping. “My queen, she is correct.”\n\n“I just need witnesses to this negotiation,” I said. “The queen is letting Ash go. In return, I will search out the remaining traitors within the Pit.”\n\nPeta cleared her throat. “And then we will leave without pursuit. Make sure you add that in.”\n\nI glanced at the big cat. “Yes, there will be no punishment or pursuit regardless of how I find the traitors. Regardless of who I may have to injure or even kill to do as you ask.”\n\nFiametta growled under her breath. “Fine. Let it be done.”\n\nI stood and rubbed my hands together. “Bring her out, Cactus.”\n\nCactus gave a start. “Me? You put her in there, you pull her out.”\n\nGlaring at him, I pointed at Fiametta. “Pull her out, or I’ll leave you behind when I go.”\n\n“Damn, you’re cranky when you haven’t had breakfast.” He dropped to his knees and pressed his hands into the stone, softening the rock around Fiametta. Brand rushed forward and helped his queen out of the stone. She whispered something to him and he spun, the crossbow flying toward my head.\n\nI ducked, but the bow still hit me, slamming into my shoulder. I stumbled backward and went for my spear as Peta leapt in front of me. A ring of fire burst up around us, like a cage that increasingly shrank.\n\nFiametta stood over me. “These two men are loyal to me, you didn’t really think any negotiation we made in front of them would hold, did you?”\n\nPinned to the ground, Peta laid her body over mine, protecting me from the heat, I stared up at Fiametta. “You know, I’m beginning to think the rulers of all the families are assholes.”\n\nThe door swung open with a bang behind us but I couldn’t see who it was. However, the voice, when I heard it, made me want to weep with relief.\n\n“That’s my sister you have unlawfully restrained.”\n\nBelladonna had arrived.\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nThings moved quickly after that and not in the direction I’d been hoping for. Manacles were clamped onto my wrists and I was dragged to the dungeon along with Peta and Ash. The steam filled, gloomy rooms were almost a relief to the constant dry heat of the rest of the Pit.\n\nStrung up by my wrists, Ash was on my left and Peta was chained in her leopard form by the neck on the right. I leaned against the wall behind me. “I’m beginning to think this is our thing.”\n\nAsh gave a low grunt. “What do you mean, our thing?”\n\nI tugged at the chains, knowing they were more than just metal and actually blocked our ability to reach our power, not unlike our own cells at home did. “This is the third dungeon we’ve been in together. Think we can make it four for four?”"

        "content": "He rolled his head toward me. “Are you trying to be funny while we’re locked up waiting to be pushed into a bubbling pool of lava?”\n\nI shrugged. “Maybe. You aren’t laughing, so I’m guessing—”\n\n“Lark, stop it. We aren’t going to survive this. I thought I could at least get you out of here and now you’ve gone and screwed that up.”\n\n“What?” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. “Are you serious?”\n\n“One thing, I asked one thing of you—to go with Brand and save your own life—and you couldn’t even do that.”\n\nThe disappointment in his voice cut through me like a knife, reminding me of just how many times I’d disappointed my father and those around me. I turned my head away, letting my hair fall forward to hide the tears that fell. Peta gave a soft cry and tried to reach me but we were too far apart.\n\n“Larkspur . . . are you . . . crying?” The sound of chains rattling and the shuffling of his feet filled the space around us. I kept my head turned away, it shouldn’t hurt so much, but there had been a part of me that so badly wanted to prove to Ash that I could do this on my own. That I could get him out of here; that I could get us all out of here.\n\nMy pride had sunk that particular ship.\n\n“Lark, I was trying to make you angry. I don’t really mean what I said,” Ash said. “I thought that was what you were asking of me, when you started talking about being in here together.”\n\nI wiped my cheeks as best I could with the side of my arm and turned to him but got no further than opening my mouth.\n\nThe main doors clanged open and in swept Belladonna, her pale red and yellow skirts swirling in the steam. She came to a stop in front of us, her hands clasped behind her back. “Larkspur, I see you’re in trouble again.”\n\nI managed a smile, but even I knew it was weak at best. “Yeah, looks like I could use some help.”\n\n“I can get you out on a technicality, but not Ash.” She raised a hand, stopping me from interrupting. “We won’t leave him, I promise. But for now, let me get you out of here. It may be all I can do before I leave.”\n\n“Leave, what’s going on?” My first thought was of home, of the Rim and all that could have happened in the short time since I’d been gone. Bella shook her head.\n\n“I am the interim ruler of the Rim. Father has gone . . .away for a time.”\n\nI jerked at my chains. “Away. What do you mean?”\n\nShe shook her head. “Now is not the time. We can discuss it when you are home. But I must go back swiftly, things are unsettled there. Our siblings are causing problems. Of all, can you believe Keeda is being the worst?”\n\nI could. Our younger sister was a great deal like their mother, Cassava.\n\nI nodded and she snapped her fingers. Brand came forward out of the gloom and unlocked my manacles and Peta’s. He didn’t apologize for swinging his crossbow at me, and I didn’t apologize for sinking Fiametta into the ground. His movements were jerky and more than once he banged the manacles against my wrists as he removed them.\n\n“Bella,” I said, “what was the technicality?”\n\n“You are still assigned to me as a bodyguard. And since I am here, I need you at my side.” She smiled, though there was a distant pain in her eyes. “I’m glad you called for my help, because I could not have come unless you asked for it. As per my instructions.”\n\n“You . . . you wanted to come on your own?” We walked out of the dungeon and into the throne room where Fiametta waited. She didn’t have a chance to answer me.\n\nBella’s whole demeanor changed, from the way she walked to the tilt of her head. Regal was the first thought that hit the front of my brain. Of course, none of that mattered in the moments that followed.\n\nFiametta smiled. “Lark, I will take your confession now. You will be tried for the death of the four Enders, and Ash’s life will be held in trust as if it were your own.”\n\n“Shit,” Bella whispered under her breath and I had to agree. This was what I wanted, but if I understood Fiametta correctly, Ash would still be killed if I were found guilty.\n\nBelladonna stepped forward. “No trial is needed.”\n\n“What?” Shock flickered through me like lightning through a summer sky—a sharp flash followed by the certainty I hadn’t seen what I’d thought I’d seen. Or in this case, heard.\n\nMy sister held her hand out to Fiametta and those few around us—mostly Enders and one old man who held a pen over a piece of parchment—fell silent. “There does not need to be a trial. It is a waste of time. The law states for an Ender to kill another Ender is death.”\n\nFiametta nodded, her eyes narrowing ever so slightly. “This is true.”\n\nBelladonna smiled. “Larkspur has confessed to killing four of your Enders. You accept this as truth?”\n\nI made a choking sound and Bella glared at me. “Be quiet, I’m about to save you.”\n\nThe queen’s eyes narrowed farther. “I do accept that as truth.” What the hell was my sister up to? She was making my sentence of death a certainty.\n\nShe snapped her fingers at the old man and he scuttled forward. I didn’t recognize him but he was a Terraling by his deep brown eyes and tanned skin. “My lady.” He bowed as he held out the parchment. Bella took it and handed it to Fiametta.\n\n“Would you read it out loud please?” Bella asked, her voice dripping with sweetness. “I ask only because another person might be accused of lying, and speaking only what they wish to be heard. As the queen, you will be above such reproach. Just read the outlined section please.”"

        "content": "Fiametta snapped the paper and then began to read. “If any Ender should kill another Ender, they shall be sentenced to death. As Enders are trained to the highest skill level with weapons and magic they shall be held to a higher standard.” Fiametta blew out a breath. “This is nothing new, Belladonna.”\n\n“Please, the next few lines are the most important.” She clasped her hands together, holding them at her waist.\n\nFiametta shrugged. “But should an Ender be killed by someone not with that title, their death shall be considered just. If those trained to the highest standard fall, it is to be their time to return to the mother goddess.”\n\nBella held her hand out to Fiametta, taking the paper back. “This is truth?”\n\n“Yes, of course it is,” Fiametta snapped and then her eyes widened. The net Belladonna had carefully laid seemed to visibly settle over her. “Damn, you are your mother’s daughter. Clever girl.”\n\n“In this case, I will thank you, and take that as a compliment.” Belladonna lifted one hand, palm upward. “Your Enders were killed before Larkspur took her final testing to become an Ender in full. Therefore she is within her rights, and they were meant to return to the mother goddess. You may not execute her, or Ash in her stead.”\n\nBella swept toward me, but Fiametta stopped her. “Belladonna, read the next line on that paper . . . if you will.”\n\nMy sister closed her eyes and I knew that whatever happened next on the sheet was going to be bad. Her hand trembled so I took the paper from her, unfolding it so I could read the remainder of the section.\n\nThe words were about as shitty as I could have imagined. “Those who kill an Ender shall yet be punished, for death is not to be taken lightly. And the one who shall mete out that punishment will be the ruler of the house the Enders were taken from.” I lowered the paper and looked straight at Fiametta. “I assume you have something in mind?”\n\nHer smile was not nice, the edges of her lips hard with cruelty. “I have just the thing for a spoiled royal who thinks she can come into my home and do whatever she pleases without facing a single consequence.” She walked up to me and leaned in close, her words only for my ears. “A royal who will not willingly help another ruler.” She clapped her hands together and Brand strode forward, handing her a coil of rope.\n\nFiametta pointed the coil at me—leather, not rope—“Strip her.”\n\nBelladonna gasped. “You can’t truly mean to do to this.”\n\n“Cassava has obviously misled you, little Terraling. We are not friends, and neither are our families.” Fiametta uncoiled the rope and her hands lit up as she called on the fire. Like a living snake it wrapped around the leather, lighting it.\n\nMy sister spun to me. “Lark, fight her!”\n\nPeta trembled beside me, her fear bleeding into my heart. “Lark, this is not a punishment you can survive, the lava whip is deadly to any who don’t carry fire in their veins.”\n\nFiametta shrugged. “You won’t do as I ask. Unless you have changed your mind?”\n\nAll I had to do was agree to help her hunt the traitors, the two that on my own I would have gone after.\n\nPride had gotten me into this mess. Perhaps humility would allow me to find a way out. “I will do . . . as you ask.”\n\nThere was a heavy pause in the air and she patted me on the head. “Well done. I will only give you half the lashes.” She smirked and my jaw dropped.\n\nMaggie stepped forward. “How I have waited for this. Better even than the Pit, your death will be slow.” Along with two other Enders she grabbed me and they stripped the clothes from my body, leaving me as bare as the day I was born.\n\n“On your knees,” Fiametta commanded and I dropped, a slow steady fury building in my guts. How could she do this in front of her people, and they allow it? The answer was simple. The same way the people of the Deep had bowed to Requiem. The same way my own family had bowed to Cassava.\n\nChild, do not fight her. This is part of your training, this is part of your journey. Hold tightly to the earth, hold tightly to me and I will see you through this. The mother goddess spoke softly and I reached for the power underneath my knees. The mountain’s essence filled me, like a cup overflowing with water and I squeezed it, wrapping it around me.\n\nThe whip sailed through the air, cracking at the last second before it touched my back. At first I thought I would be spared the pain as the lash left my back, for a split second I felt nothing.\n\nI was so very wrong.\n\nA blaze of pain roared up my spine, tracing the lines of the whip as if a serpent made of pure fire had lain across my skin. I couldn’t stop the cry that escaped and I heard it echoed from Bella, as she sobbed. Echoed in Peta as she cried out with me.\n\nThe lash fell again and I collapsed to my hands and knees, the pain cutting through me, feeling as though it would truly divide my body wherever it touched. I lost count how many times the whip burned over my body, time receded and I floated in a place where my body and spirit seemed to have disconnected from my mind.\n\nIn that haze, an intense hatred blossomed. Fiametta, and Requiem. Leaders of two families of elementals and neither deserved the position, nor the power. Yet they were given it. Even my own father was a complete mess, his mind and spirit twisted by Cassava to the point he was unable to trust past the fear. The mother goddess had allowed it to happen, and had allowed this to happen.\n\nI was the one being punished for deaths I hadn’t caused.\n\nThe world was not fair. I knew that and was not fool enough to think otherwise. But this was too far. The anger powered through me and I clung to it, riding it like a wild horse that would carry me into battle. The whip was coming, the sound of it in the air cut through every other noise around me. I pushed myself up so I was on my knees."

        "content": "Looking over my shoulder at Fiametta as she wielded the whip, I saw something I didn’t expect. Her face was a mask of sorrow, and even . . . grief. As if she didn’t want to hurt me.\n\n“Enough, you’ll kill her!” a voice cut through the pain, and the whip didn’t make contact with me, but fell to the ground, twisting and writhing with the flame that licked along its length.\n\nCactus stepped between me and Fiametta, his hands in front of him, lines of power running up his arms in green and red; he was ready to fight for me against his own queen and the thought stunned me. I could count on one hand the number of people who’d stood for me in my life, placing my life above theirs.\n\nMy body burned, every breath I drew into my lungs stretched the skin over my back and I wished I didn’t have to breathe at all. Yet I stayed where I was, swaying, but upright.\n\nFiametta’s blue eyes held mine. “The punishment is done.”\n\nThe anger didn’t leave me, but my strength finally did and I slid to the floor, flat on my belly.\n\nMy cheek pressed into the cold stone below me and a shiver coursed through me, which cracked open the burns on my back, the crispy skin cracking. Belladonna dropped beside me, her hands on my face.\n\nI didn’t know what she said, the words blurred by the waves of pain rippling through me, wiping out anything that made sense. I closed my eyes and held tightly to the only thing I knew would get me through.\n\nRage.\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nGactus knelt beside me, his words breaking through the buzzing in my ears. “You can’t Travel with her like this. She has to heal first.” His hands were gentle, touching me only where the lash hadn’t fallen. My face, front of my neck and palms were the only safe zones I could feel.\n\nPeta pushed him away and dropped her face to mine. “Lark, draw from me.”\n\nI knew the pain would transfer to her, and I wasn’t willing to do that. I couldn’t manage much more than the one word.\n\n“No.”\n\nShe let out a soft cry and lowered herself to the ground beside me, but spoke over her shoulder. “I will carry her.”\n\nHands lifted me, cracking the skin on my back yet again, the warm blood oozing down my sides and into Peta’s fur as they laid me on her back, still face down. In my head, I knew she couldn’t possibly move smoother than a stretcher held by two people, yet I didn’t feel her steps. She dropped into a stalking crouch and crept forward, her paws barely rising from the ground. I rolled in and out of consciousness, my nerve endings driving the pain deeper into my body. I couldn’t stop the twitching of my muscles as I fought the agony that wanted to break me. In that moment, I understood that was the full purpose of the lashing—not just to wound me, or kill me, but ultimately break my spirit—to bring me to my knees and make me pliable to Fiametta’s will.\n\n“Bring her in.”\n\nI lifted my eyes. We were back at Brand’s home, and Smoke directed Peta to take me to my room.\n\n“No, not here.”\n\nPeta gave a low growl. “You have no choice. The healers are still sleeping.” I doubted that. More likely that Fiametta refused to allow them to help me. For just a moment my anger overwhelmed the pain, giving me a brief second of relief.\n\nThe relief evaporated like my sweat as Cactus tucked his hands under my shoulders and Brand took hold of my feet.\n\nAs careful as they were when they moved me from Peta’s back to the bed, I couldn’t stop the sharp cry from my lips. I blacked out, the fiery pain driving straight through my consciousness, cutting me off from the world in a fogged haze.\n\nA soft hand on my brow brought me around and I turned my head, pressing my cheek into the silken sheet below me. “Smoke.”\n\n“Shh. You must rest. I have something for your back. It will draw the heat out but . . . it will be very painful.”\n\nI tried to turn so I could see her face but she pressed her hand against my head. “Lark, you must not move. You will be scarred as it is, but every time you move, you make it worse.”\n\nMy entire view consisted of: the pale blue sheets, Peta’s green eyes as she sat in her housecat form beside me with her tail wrapped around my neck, and the grey stone of the far wall. I kept my breathing shallow and my voice low. “Do it, Smoke. If it means I will heal faster, then do it.”\n\n“The wrap will take an hour to prepare. Rest and whatever you do, don’t move,” she said and walked away, her footsteps fading. The sounds of the household were dim, humming in my ears with the drone of a beehive. Peta stiffened. “Lark, he’s coming.”\n\n“Who?” I mumbled the question, the pain causing a weird drowsy state I couldn’t seem to fight. Peta’s head dropped forward and she let out a long, low hiss as her eyes closed.\n\nFootsteps, the sound of the door opening and then the flash of a black cloak along the edges of my vision. “Dear Larkspur, that bitch really did a number on you, didn’t she?”\n\nHe dropped into a crouch so he could look me in the eye, except that his cloak hid his facial features from me. I knew nothing except he was a man, and part of the reason I had the lashing. If he hadn’t taken the papers from me I could have made a case that the Enders were not fatally injured. That they’d been wounded, but that was all.\n\nThe pain made my tongue loosen. “What did you do to my cat?”\n\n“She’s sleeping, like everyone else here. You know, the Salamanders are a foolishly proud group. They think they are safe here in their little mountain. But I’ll tell you a secret. . . they aren’t. They have enemies. The firewyrms hate them with a passion.”"

        "content": "“You made them enemies, didn’t you?”\n\nHe gave me a wink. “Maybe I did help it along a little.”\n\n“And you are making the Salamanders sleep.”\n\nLaughing, he nodded. “Yes, it makes the queen twitchy. And of course, I was the one who finished off the Enders. You must have guessed that by now.”\n\nI blinked several times, unable to nod.\n\nHe laughed and leaned forward. “I like you, Larkspur. I always have. I wish I could trust you.” With one hand, he reached out and touched my nose. On his middle finger was a deep red chunk of ruby set into a silver band. Lines of power flickered around it as though it were alive. It could only be one thing: the elemental stone that controlled fire.\n\n“Nice ring, your momma give it to you?” I slurred.\n\n“As a matter of fact, she did. Quite the woman my mother was.” He withdrew his hand and tipped his head to one side. “You’ll be leaving after this little fiasco?”\n\nI tried to think what the point would be in lying to him. Why would I stay now? Fiametta proclaimed Ash and I could leave, and Cactus and Peta were free to go as well, as far as I knew. I vaguely recalled Belladonna saying goodbye. That the Rim needed her. No reason to say, and yet, I wanted to cover my ass in case something slowed me.\n\n“Unless someone forces my hand, yes, I’ll be leaving as soon as I heal,” I murmured.\n\n“Ah, lovely, just lovely. You’ll leave Fiametta to me then. I like that. Sorry about the bridge earlier. I was under the impression you were helping Fia—by the way, love the nickname you gave her—to straighten things out here. Can’t have that, now can I?”\n\nMy tongue was thick and all I wanted was a drink. A long, cold drink. “Water.”\n\n“Oh, of course. Here.” He held out his hand, and in his palm, water pooled, clear as a river coursing from the top of a mountain. He held his hand to my mouth and another time I would have hesitated, questioned his seeming kindness. But the fire in me burned hot, devouring the moisture in my body at a rate I didn’t think I could keep up. He tipped his hand and the water trickled into my mouth at a steady rate until I turned my face away. “Enough.”\n\nHe stood, took one step away and then stopped. “May I make a suggestion, Larkspur?”\n\nI stared up at him, wondering if he really was asking. The whole conversation felt like he’d just wanted to talk. Which was weird at best. “Only if you tell me your name.”\n\n“Ah, yes, everyone wants to know my name. You can call me Blackbird. On account of the black cloak.”\n\nInternally, I struggled with what to do. He was an Undine, wearing a ring that gave him power of a Salamander. How the hell was I supposed to stop him? And did I even want to?\n\n“Did I meet you when I was in the Deep?” I spit the question out as I tried to place him. He shook his head.\n\n“We’ve met, Larkspur, and I like you. But you will never, ever guess who I am.” He slapped his hand onto my back, his fingers burying into my soft, tender flesh, blood oozing out. My back arched and I screamed as he dug his fingers deeper into the wound.\n\n“I’m doing this for your own good. You’ll thank me later. And if you care to blame anyone, blame the mother goddess. She asked me to heal you and that is the only reason I do what I do for you. I am sworn to her.”\n\nAt least that was what I thought he said; I struggled to hear anything over my own howls into the air. His hand seemed to sink through what was left of the flesh on my back and to my bones, his fingers sliding along my spine.\n\nI couldn’t even lash out at him. My body convulsed with pain to the point of being stunned. A rolling, crushing wave that stole my ability to breathe, think, or even consider anything beyond my next heartbeat and wondering if it would stop and the pain would end.\n\nAs suddenly as it began, he took his hand away, bent and put his lips next to my ear. “I’m sorry your back is not pristine as it was. I cannot heal what is no longer there, and Fiametta didn’t leave me much to work with.” He pressed his cheek against mine. “Leave tomorrow, Larkspur. Or I will make you wish Fiametta had her lava whip again.”\n\nHe kissed me on the cheek and with a swirl of his cloak was gone.\n\nI sat up and took a few steps after him before I realized what I was doing. Freezing in place I lifted my arms. My left arm had been burned badly, but now there was no pain.\n\nBehind me, Peta yowled and leapt to the floor, her tiny feet sounding more like she was in her leopard form. “Lark, your back, it’s healed. How can that be? What happened?”\n\nWobbling as I turned, I shook my head. “The one in the cloak, he did it.”\n\n“The one who tried to drop the bridge out from under you? That makes no sense.”\n\nI put a hand to my head. “No, it doesn’t.”\n\nWeak, exhausted from the lashing and subsequent healing, I lay back down on the bed. “Peta, get Cactus and Ash. Tell them we leave as soon as I wake.”\n\nShe nodded and I closed my eyes so I might have imagined the rough-tongued lick across my forehead.\n\nI sunk into a sleep so deep, I knew it was not just fatigue, or pain induced. No, this was something more.\n\nI’d felt her touch before, and knew it well.\n\nThe mother goddess wanted to speak to me. Which was just as well since I had a few questions for her.\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n“Larkspur.” That one word shivered down my spine, the power she held in each syllable of my name, a visceral thing. There was no warmth in her voice, not like before. She called to me and I was forced to answer."

        "content": "Blinking, I sat up. We were in the Rim, the towering redwoods swaying lightly in the breeze. Low hanging clouds flowed through the boughs of cedar, but unlike the normal white, they spread in pale purple filaments that seemed to cling to everything. The mother goddess stood next to the biggest redwood in the forest, the sides of it easily reaching fifteen feet to either side of her. The dark red color of the trunk offset the soft cream dress the mother goddess wore, her long pale gold hair a shade lighter than mine. A part of me was disturbed that she always chose to come to me in the guise of my own, long dead mother.\n\nI bowed my head. “Mother.”\n\n“Child, you have saved Ash from death. Well done.” Her hand touched the top of my head.\n\nQuestions bubbled up on my tongue and I struggled to figure out where to start.\n\n“Just say the words as they come, Larkspur.” She spoke quietly, but with authority and I stopped trying to think too much about what I had to say.\n\n“The man in the cloak, he calls himself Blackbird. Why would you tell him to heal me? He’s an asshole.” Okay, maybe that was a bit too bold for conversing with a goddess, but I had to know. I lifted my head a fraction of an inch so I could look up at her.\n\nHer eyes were closed as if deep in thought.\n\n“He is my child, as are you. He serves me in his own way, though you will not understand his part in your life until your journey is close to an end. The balance must be kept. For everything good, there is something vile.” There was a heavy pause as she drew in a deep breath. “And now I will ask of you one more thing, a task I know you will fight. A task you perhaps have already guessed.”\n\nShivers of fear trickled through me. Her words were enough to set me on edge and send my mind into a whirling maelstrom of questions. “I am your servant,” I whispered.\n\n“You will stay in the Pit and save the firewyrms.”\n\n“Why don’t you just stop Fiametta? What could I possibly do that would be better than you showing up and putting her in her place?”\n\nHer lips quirked upward at the edges and she crouched beside me, her knees tightly together as she leaned over them toward me. “Child, there are rules that define this world, rules even for one such as myself. My consort flaunts the rules as he tries to influence things,” she reached out and touched the griffin tooth hanging from my neck, “and one day he will suffer for it. Remember this, if you remember nothing else. The rules set in place are to protect you, to keep you safe and your soul intact.”\n\nI couldn’t stop the sigh that slipped out. “So long story short, you mean you can’t stop Fiametta?”\n\n“That is correct. Rules and free will, they are a juxtaposition that has existed from the beginning of time.” She stood in a single smooth motion that made it seem as if she’d never been crouched beside me. “Save the firewyrms, Larkspur. That is what I want of you, and in doing so, you will save many lives.”\n\nThe mother goddess put her hands on my back, a soft breath escaping her that sounded like a whisper of pain. “You should not have been punished, but I cannot turn back time. We all make mistakes, Larkspur. Even I have.” Her fingers trailed the deep pits and ruts of the wounds and I could see the terrain as though I looked at a painting. My back was all but destroyed, muscles and ligaments burned apart, my spine peeking through in places, exposed to the open air. The man in the cloak, Blackbird, though I doubted that was his true name, may have healed me, but as he’d said, he could not put back what was no longer there.\n\nHer fingers felt like a butterfly dancing across my skin. “Save the firewyrms, and I will make this right.”\n\nMy jaw dropped and again anger curled upward like a creeping vine that no matter how you dug, you never truly got all the roots. They always found purchase somewhere else.\n\n“Heal me first,” I said, not dropping my eyes.\n\nThe mother goddess stared at me, her eyes emotionless, but her tone held more than a little anger. “This is not a negotiation, child.”\n\n“I believe it is. Who else have you got within the Pit with the strength to possibly stop Fiametta?” A small part of me struggled to understand why I was fighting her on this.\n\nThe mother goddess took a step back. “You are walking a fine line between obedience and outright defiance. That is not a line you can balance for long and you will have to decide if you are truly one of my children, or one of the banished.”\n\nThe threat was clear. Do as she wanted or be cast out to die alone. I bowed my head, but said nothing.\n\nSleep rolled over me in a wave, dragging me down into the place of dreams and nightmares. The mother goddess was gone and I found myself on my knees again, reliving the fire whip as it seared through my back. I jerked awake and a hand rubbed through the back of my hair. “Easy, Lark. It’s over.”\n\nAsh’s voice soothed the fear and I lowered my head to the bed once more. One of his arms encircled my waist and he pulled me against him. The warmth radiating from his body into mine eased the aches and residual tension my muscles held.\n\nI rolled in his arms and buried my face against his neck, breathing him in. A soft, furred body curled up at the back of my neck. Peta dropped her head into the crook of my neck. “Sleep, Lark. Sleep and in the morning we will leave.”\n\nBut would I leave? Or would I do as the mother goddess commanded? My thoughts jumbled together; my body twitching and jerking as I fell into a fitful sleep. Disobeying her would mean I was leaving the firewyrms to fight on their own. Scar’s eyes floated through my mind, the soft glimmer of amethyst."

        "content": "The morning came soon enough, the light shimmering through the reflective tunnels above bringing me out of my stupor. Voices drifted to me, like dust motes floating in the air. Smoke’s voice was the same husky pitch but pain laced her words.\n\n“I don’t care. Just . . .he can’t be gone. He can’t be. He was my baby.” A sob rippled out of her and I was up and moving before I could think better of it. Ash was beside me and threw a sheet around my body, but not before he gasped.\n\n“Lark, your back.”\n\n“I know it looks like worm tunnels and goose shit.”\n\n“No, it’s not,” Ash said, his hand on my arm stopping me. The arm he held was the one burned. But the burn was completely gone and in its place a tattoo rested on my skin. A vine of deepest green with thorns of a dark purple curled over my muscles.\n\n“Your back is more of the same,” he said.\n\nThe mother goddess had healed me after all. I closed my eyes and whispered my thanks to her.\n\nAnother cry from Smoke turned my attention back to the moment at hand.\n\nI stumbled forward as my legs tried to buckle. How long was I out? I thought it was just a day, but the last time I’d felt like this, I’d been coming out of a week of trials with the mother goddess.\n\nThe main living area was lit with soft burning candles, their light flickering over the sober faces. Brand sat beside Smoke, holding her tightly as tears ran down his face. The two older boys, Stryker and his brother Cano stood against the far wall, their faces also wet with tears as their chests heaved.\n\nStryker stepped forward, “Mom, I didn’t know; none of us did.”\n\nBrand stood as Smoke held a hand out to her oldest son, drawing him to her until she held him against her chest. “I know it’s not your fault. The mother goddess has turned her eyes away from our people.”\n\nHer words shocked me and I had to bite down on the question that formed. Where was Tinder? The little boy with the sparkling eyes and the bright personality? The one with the questions that were never ending?\n\nI gasped as the understanding hit me in the chest. The how of it didn’t really matter, but I knew . . . Tinder was gone. Brand’s eyes flicked to me, and there was no malice in them.\n\n“You are free to go, Terralings. Fiametta has declared you are not to be stopped.” He dropped his eyes and tightened his hold on his wife. I stepped forward and went to my knees beside Smoke. She’d been kind to me, one of the few in the Pit who had.\n\n“Smoke.”\n\nHer eyes flicked to mine, the gray centers that so resembled her name were awash with tears. “It is not safe here for you, Lark.”\n\nI shook my head. “It looks as though it is not safe for you either. How did it happen?”\n\n“I said,” Brand grabbed my arm and hauled me up to my feet, “you are free to go. Isn’t that enough?”\n\nI didn’t jerk away from him, but stepped into his guard. “Tell me what happened. Maybe I can help.”\n\nAsh let out a soft groan. “This is going to be the Deep all over again.”\n\nI cast a glare at Ash and he said nothing more. Brand tightened his grip on my arm, and for a moment the pressure reached the point where I thought I would have to back down as my tendons were squeezed over my forearm bones.\n\n“We went to swim in the Pit,” Stryker said, breaking the silence. Brand let go of me, his hand falling to his side. Stryker stepped forward and circled his arms around his mother, holding her as much as she was holding him. Stryker’s young frame trembled from his jaw to his bobbing knee. “Tinder ran ahead of us and jumped into the Pit. He was fine, laughing and splashing. I swear it.”\n\nI frowned, but said nothing. Someone must have struck at Tinder, someone had to have hurt him. Yet I struggled to see someone hurting a child, especially one as likeable as he.\n\nAn image of Bram being stolen from my arms hit me like a runaway bull and I sucked in a quiet breath. Logically I knew Cassava had no reason to attack Tinder. Even if I did have a soft spot for the little boy, what did it gain her? Nothing was the simple answer, yet I couldn’t help but want to blame her for another death. It took all I had to remain quiet and let Stryker speak when he was ready.\n\nHis eyes were distant as if he were seeing something only he could see. A shiver ran lightly through his body.\n\n“I almost jumped in. I stopped at the edge and yelled down to him and he looked up at me, a funny expression on his face and then he just . . . the lava burned him like he wasn’t a Salamander, so fast, like he was nothing and then he was sucked down and gone. Like he was never there. He didn’t even have time to cry out, it was so fast. There were other kids, same thing happened. Seven or eight of them, just . . . gone.” Stryker dropped his head as a sob rippled out of him.\n\nSmoke stroked his hair with one hand, whispering a song to him, the words inaudible but the tune soothing, even to me.\n\nI put a hand over my eyes, seeing all too easily little Tinder sucked down under a wave of lava. Saw his eyes full of pain and confusion, of all the years he could have had, stolen from him.\n\nLike Bram.\n\n“Take me to Fiametta,” I said, not bothering to hide the thickness of my words, the way tears clogged my throat. I would stay, because I couldn’t leave when children were being killed. Whatever I could do, I would.\n\n“You can’t do anything, Lark.” Brand shook his head. “No one can.”\n\nI slowly straightened my spine to my full height, softening my words at the last moment. He’d lost his son, the least I could do was remember the pain of that loss. “Are you sure?”"

        "content": "We stared at each other, and maybe there would have been more said. But that chance would never come.\n\nFootsteps pounded toward us, a staccato that didn’t sound good. An Ender, young and new to the title by the looks of the acne on his face, stuck his head in the door. His words were gasped, out of breath as he was.\n\n“The lava is flowing.”\n\nBrand snorted. “It always is.”\n\nThe young Ender shook his head. “No, it’s out of control.”\n\nBrand stood and strode toward him. “Fiametta will deal with—”\n\nThe kid shook his head again, harder and it was then I saw the fear stamped on his face. “No, that’s just it. The lava is wild, and even the queen can’t stop it.”\n\nA collective breath was drawn in and held within the room. I may not have been a Salamander, but even I knew news couldn’t get much worse.\n\nThe funny thing about assumptions is when you are proven wrong, it’s amazing just how very wrong you can be.\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\nBrand led the way, running out of the house, his hands going to his weapons. “All of you stay inside!”\n\nI leapt after him ignoring the fact I was wearing nothing more than a silk sheet; there was no way I was going to sit inside and wait for a river of lava to roll over me. Outside their home, the steady growing noise I’d been hearing became clear. The lava flowed over the banks of the river, rushing with a speed that seemed to pick up even as I stared at it.\n\n“Pigeon balls,” I whispered to myself. The heat had at least tripled just in stepping outside of the walls. All my thoughts of staying and helping, of bringing Fiametta to justice for the deaths of the firewyrms was swept away with the reality of our situation. “We have to get out of here.”\n\nAsh put a hand on me. “We have to get to the Traveling room. That’s our only way out.”\n\nI nodded and Peta butted her head against my leg. “Lark, look at the lava.”\n\nI did as she asked as an Ender stepped toward the flowing red death, letting it wrap around his legs as if it were water.\n\nExcept that it wasn’t water; not even for him. He screamed as the lower half of his body sunk, dissolving as we watched. Someone gasped, it might have been Smoke, but it might have been me too. The Ender writhed and struggled as he slowly died, his upper body twitching as the lava slipped up over his waist, his head dropping so his chin rested on his chest and then his whole body lit on fire.\n\nOn fire.\n\nHis element no longer protecting him.\n\nWhat in the mother goddess’s name was going on?\n\nYou can save them all, Larkspur, if you are brave enough. Her voice whispered to me. I wanted to shake my head but a small part of me wanted to believe her.\n\nI grabbed Brand by the arm. “We have to assume that could happen to any of you. We need to get to Fiametta.”\n\nThe younger Ender, Jack by his hasty introduction, nodded. “That’s the plan. The queen is going to deal with this but she wants all her people with her.”\n\nBrand herded his family after Jack. “Go with him. I want to see how deep this goes.”\n\nSmoke’s eyes glistened. “Be careful, my love, I can’t lose you, too.”\n\nHe reached for her and they kissed, a mere brush of lip against lip and yet there was emotion enough that once more I felt I was witnessing something special, and intimate. I glanced away.\n\nAsh touched my arm. “You need to get dressed.”\n\nWithout a word, I strode toward the house and tried not to think about the way the Ender had fallen to the lava. As if he were nothing--as frail and mortal as any human. How could that be? Our elements didn’t just leave us, they didn’t stop working for no reason.\n\nI had my pants on and was tightening the straps on my vest as the thoughts racing through my head slowed, and with them my hands.\n\nPeta leapt on the bed and put her paws on my chest. “I sense it in you. What have you thought of?”\n\nI stared at the wall as my mind settled on the realization like a bird landing softly on the spindly branch of a too small tree. The weight of it slid over my shoulders. “Someone is blocking their ability. Just like my ability was blocked by Cassava when I was young,” I whispered the words. “It has to be the cloaked one. Blackbird.”\n\n“That’s impossible,” Peta said. “You saw it yourself. He is an Undine who also carries Spirit and he also can reach the earth. And he is carrying a ring tied to fire. That would mean . . . three elements isn’t possible.” Yet her voice wavered at the end.\n\nAsh stuck his head in, breaking up our conversation. “We have to move if we’re going to get to the Traveling room.”\n\nFollowing Ash, who in turn followed Brand, we made our way to the far side of the living quarters to a ladder cut into the mountain. Brand gestured. “You three get up there. Peta, you can lead them to the Traveling room from there.”\n\nShe nodded, and leapt up several rungs to hang for a moment as she answered. “Hurry.”\n\nAsh held his hand out to Brand and the fire elemental slowly took it. “The lava is rising fast, and the Traveling room lies below it.”\n\n“Understood,” Ash said, letting go. “Be safe my friend.”\n\nBrand turned away and I knew if he went, we wouldn’t see him again. Smoke would lose yet another piece of her heart.\n\nI called after him. “Brand.”\n\nHe didn’t stop.\n\n“Brand, you will break her if you do this. She deserves better.”\n\nHis whole body stiffened. The air in the cavern thickened with black smoke and I thought he wouldn’t turn."

        "content": "“Damn you, Terraling.” He spun toward us and pulled himself up the ladder after Peta who scrambled ahead of him.\n\nI climbed after him, Ash on my heels and I realized we were missing someone. “Cactus, where is he?”\n\n“The queen asked for him while you were out,” Ash answered and then there was no air for questions, barely air for breathing.\n\nAt the top of the ladder, the thick smoke hung dark enough to dim the glittering light that lit the tunnels. Brand didn’t reach back for me, which was fine. I crawled over the lip of the ladder, coughing as I struggled to breathe. Ash wasn’t doing any better and we scooted forward until the air cleared a little.\n\nBrand led us toward the Traveling room, stopping at the stairwell that led down to it. I peered past him to stare at the bubbling lava that curled up the steps toward us. That made the decision easy. No going home that way.\n\nHe didn’t pause though. “The queen has a backup pair of armbands in her chambers. She’ll let you use those. I don’t know where they will take you though.”\n\n“Unless she’s using them to get her people out of here,” Peta said softly, padding ahead of us at a steady trot. She seemed totally unperturbed by the events slowly piling up. Events that had no real meaning I could see other than to wipe out the Salamanders.\n\nThe facts seemed to be that someone was trying to kill them. And I was pretty sure I knew who. It was just a matter of whether or not I could stop him.\n\nThat was the real problem; how did I find the man who called himself Blackbird and kick his ass if he carried three elements within himself? Three elements he was strong enough in that he could easily take me out. Not to mention he also carried the ring that gave him power over fire.\n\nBrand stopped suddenly and I almost walked into him, so deep within my own thoughts as I was.\n\nThe healer’s room doors were flung wide and while there was a bustling trade going on, there was almost no noise. Fiametta strode from table to table, talking to those patients laid out. Her hands brushed against cheeks, touched skin that wasn’t broken with heat blisters, gave comfort where she could.\n\nClearing his throat, Brand got her attention. “My queen, the Traveling room is cut off.”\n\n“I see.” She walked toward us, her blue eyes cool. “I suppose you want the bands from my room.”\n\nBrand nodded. “I can get them myself.”\n\n“Do that.” Her words were soft, like the precursor of rain as clouds were driven in on high, silent winds. I braced myself, facing her head on.\n\n“You think we did this somehow.”\n\nHer eyes narrowed and I expected to see lines of power running up her arms, except there was nothing. “If I thought that, I would kill you myself right now. No, this is the work of the traitors. Which you have agreed to help me find. I suggest now that you are healed, you get on it.”\n\nAsh shifted beside me and I recognized the pose. He was prepping a move that would allow him to leap up and drive both fists directly into Fiametta’s throat. Her eyes narrowed. Of course she would recognize it, being a former Ender. As much as I hated her for whipping me as she had, a part of me understood that it was the law. Even I couldn’t deny it.\n\nI put a hand on his arm. Our eyes met and he relaxed—a little, anyway.\n\n“I know who did this,” I said, just as Cactus stepped into the room. He had a long burn up his left arm and there was soot all over his face, which made his eyes stand out even more, but he was at least intact.\n\nHe gave me a wink and blew Ash a kiss. “Good to see you two made it out all right.”\n\n“Don’t speak too soon, pet,” Fiametta said and then turned to me once more. “What do you think has been done, Terraling?” Her voice dropped into almost a coo, that I recognized for what it was.\n\nDangerous.\n\nThis was the tricky part, yet there was no nice way to speak the truth. I fought not to cross my arms over my chest; I had done nothing, and yet I felt like I was already defending myself. “Your power has been blocked. And that’s why your element has turned on you.”\n\nSomeone from the table to the right of us moaned. “The mother goddess has turned her eyes from us. We have offended her and now she will cleanse her children of their sins.”\n\nFiametta didn’t move. “How could you know this if you were not the one—”\n\n“Because Cassava has done it to me in the past. It is possible, and it’s the only thing that makes sense. It is the power of Spirit being used on you.” I waved my hand at the room, and the people in it. “How else would you explain this? Your people burning in their own element? Your inability to reach your power? The firewyrms attacking for no reason? Your inability to see reason . . . all of it can be attributed to someone manipulating Spirit. I just never would have thought it could be used on this scale.”\n\nThe queen lifted her hand and there was a flicker of red tracing the inner edge of her arm. She was trying to pull on her power, but the lines flickered and died like a flame being snuffed. Her shoulder’s slumped. “Damn you for being right. This is why those who carry Spirit are killed on sight.”\n\nHer back straightened as fast as it had slumped. “Ender,” she pointed at young Jack, “I want everyone out of the mountain. Immediately.”\n\nHe clapped his hands together, and barked out orders. “You heard her, everyone head to the entrance, take nothing but the clothes on your back.”\n\nSmit, the healer who tended me several times, made eye contact with me. I jogged to his side and slid an arm around his patient, a young girl probably of an age with Stryker. “I can carry her.”"

        "content": "He nodded. “She can help you find the entrance.”\n\nPeta shifted beside me. “I can take someone.”\n\nSmit snorted. “Bad luck cat, I don’t think so.”\n\nI put a hand on him, tightening my fingers over his forearm. “Her name is Peta, and if you call her a bad luck cat again, I will forget you are a healer.”\n\nHis eyes flicked between us. He swallowed hard. “I thought the rumor was wrong about her being your familiar. Pardon me.”\n\nPeta snorted and I shifted the young girl to her back. Smit handed me two small kids with burns on the soles of their feet. Their tiny whimpers shot through me, piercing me to the core. What was the point of this, hurting children, making them suffer for something as materialistic as a crown? What did Blackbird truly hope to gain? Was it just the crown, or was I missing something?\n\nEn masse, we left the healer’s rooms, a long line of people that curled through the tunnels. In the distance was the sound of the ocean, only I knew it wasn’t water washing against the inside of the mountain, but lava roaring out of control. Ash was just ahead of me also packing a young man, his feet burned, piggy backed style.\n\n“Ash, can you block the lava behind us?”\n\nHe shook his head. “No, I can’t reach my power either. Whatever is blocking the Salamanders isn’t choosy; it’s blocking every elemental.”\n\nAnd there was too much fear in me to reach my anger and thereby reach the power of the earth. The idea traced along my mind that maybe I could use Spirit on Ash and unblock his ability but I knew so little. What if I hurt him?\n\nI had to trust we would get out of this without my powers.\n\nThe silence of the walk was unnerving, and the farther we climbed, the more the tension rose. The heat off the lava flows slowly choked us.\n\nThe mountain rumbled and the hallway wall ahead exploded inward, and a long sparkling white body followed it through. The firewyrm was far bigger than Scar, easily the size of a small elephant, only longer. It swung its head toward the cowering elementals.\n\n“Fiametta, you go too far this time.” He, and it was most definitely a ‘he’ by his deep voice not to mention his well-endowed male bits that hung low between his back legs.\n\nFiametta faced him, her hands on her hips.\n\n“Kill it.”\n\nOf course, she couldn’t understand him.\n\n“Stealing our children, you filthy Salamander,” he roared, his voice loud enough that the walls and ceiling shook, rocks tumbling around us. I cringed and jiggled the two kids as they began to cry.\n\nHe roared again. This was going to get ugly if no one did anything, which by the way, Fiametta’s Enders started forward with their weapons would be the wrong kind of “anything.”\n\n“Stop,” I yelled, placing the two children on the ground before running forward. I held my hands up. “Stop it, both of you.”\n\nAs if that was going to work. The firewyrm lunged forward, snapping at the Enders, his teeth as needle sharp as Scar’s had been, only ten times as long. Two Enders disappeared into his mouth with two crunches each. The remaining Enders backed until they were right in front of their queen.\n\n“We cannot take him like this,” Maggie said. I hadn’t even realized she was with the group until she spoke, her hair pinned under a tight skullcap of black leather.\n\n“Cactus,” Fiametta called, “blast him.”\n\nThat was the moment it became very clear why Cactus was so important to her. He could damage the firewyrms where the Salamanders with their fire only could not. His connection to the earth would allow him to actually puncture their hides.\n\nCactus was at her side and he shook his head. “This is not a fight I can help you with.”\n\nThe big firewyrm advanced on Fiametta and she held up her hand. He ignored her.\n\n“You think you rule here, but your fear is what rules this place. You are no queen.” The lizard snarled and leapt forward with his mouth gaping.\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nAs the firewyrm leapt forward, time slowed. The mother goddess whispered in my ear.\n\nSave her, Lark.\n\nDamn it to the seven hells and back, this was not my fight. And yet, I didn’t hesitate at the mother goddess’s command. I jumped in front of Fiametta and held up both my hands, as I dropped to my knees.\n\n“In the name of the mother goddess, stop!”\n\nI waited with my head bowed and my whole body tingling with apprehension. Hot breath that smelled faintly of jasmine and chili peppers swirled around me.\n\n“Who do you think you are that you can stop me with words? Are you like the other one?”\n\nLike Fiametta? The firewyrm lowered his face so we were eye to eye.\n\nI didn’t lower my hands. “Fiametta is a bitch, a liar, and a manipulator. She’s tried to wipe your people out, punished me with the intention to end my life, and in general being a grade A bitch.”\n\nHe chuckled. “Yes, all of those things and more. Why do you stop me then from snapping her in half and using her bones to pick my teeth?”\n\nI slowly lowered my hands. “Because the mother goddess wants her alive for some unknown reason. And as her chosen one, I will do all I can to make sure her wishes are fulfilled. If it were my choice, I would let the queen die and another take her position.”\n\nHe pushed his face forward until we were nose to nose. “You are the one who saved my son and tried to revive my daughter. Spirit walker, your heart is too big for your body.”\n\nThe firewyrm shook his head at the queen. “Fiametta, only because this one,” he tipped his jaw toward me, “intervenes and speaks on behalf of the mother goddess will I spare you and your people. But I want my children back.”"

        "content": "I dared to stand. “The Salamanders have missing children too. Someone is killing them.”\n\nHe shook his massive head, the horns that swept over his neck shimmering from side to side. “Sucked into the lava?”\n\nI nodded. “Yes.”\n\n“Then they are not dead. It is how our children were taken too. I feel their hearts beating yet. Come to my nest, and perhaps we can find them, Spirit Walker.” He backed up, his body disappearing into the hole he’d created.\n\nAround me it felt as though a collective breath was released and silence reigned for a few seconds longer before several voices at once broke out.\n\n“How did she stop him?”\n\n“What did they say?”\n\n“Why didn’t the queen kill the wyrm?”\n\nI turned slowly, meeting Fiametta’s gaze. Her emotions were not written on her face like others.\n\nFiametta lifted a hand. “Larkspur. You are the half breed bastard child that Basileus has kept hidden from the rest of us. Correct? You are Ulani’s child.” The unspoken question was, are you a Spirit Walker?\n\nNo point in denying the truth now. “Yes.” I didn’t take my eyes from Maggie.\n\n“Then we will discuss this once we are outside the mountain. For now I will trust you, not only with my home, but with my families’ lives,” the queen said, as she gave Maggie a look that stopped her in her tracks.\n\nFiametta turned and looked at her people. “We will exit through the main entrance, and once outside I will send some of my Enders to deal with the wyrms and the lava.”\n\nNo one argued with her, not even the Enders. I slipped back to where I’d deposited the two kids and went to scoop them up. They smiled, reaching for me, but I was pushed away, shoved hard enough from the side that I went to my knees. A big man, his red hair shorn close to his head and enough muscles on his arms to fill out three men’s sleeves glared down at me.\n\n“Don’t touch them, you filthy wyrm lover.”\n\nHe picked the kids up, their eyes wide as they stared back at me, and strode away. The Salamanders flowed around me as if I were an island in a stream. They stared at me, the coldness of their eyes like ice against my skin.\n\nPeta found me, her charge gone from her back. “They took her from me too,” she said before I could ask.\n\nAsh waited for us, his arms also empty. “Me, too.”\n\n“Guilty by association,” I murmured, as I pushed myself to my feet. Peta snorted and shook her body, shrinking to her housecat form. I held my arms out and she leapt up to me.\n\n“You can carry me.”\n\nLaughing softly, I placed her on my shoulder. “Thanks, I appreciate the vote of confidence.”\n\nFalling into step beside me, Ash shook his head. “This seems too easy. Whoever is doing this, blocking them from their element wouldn’t just let them out.”\n\n“You think it’s a trap?”\n\nHe nodded. “I’m sure of it.”\n\nWalking at the back of the long line of Salamanders, I did a head count. Fewer than five hundred souls, and that was counting the injured being carried. A trap for five hundred people . . . if they couldn’t get out of the mountain, and they were blocked from their abilities, what would happen when the lava reached them?\n\nThey’d all die.\n\nThe line stopped moving and I held back, standing ten feet behind the last Salamander.\n\nPeta sat up straight on my shoulder, looking over everyone’s head. “Why aren’t they moving?”\n\nI shrugged. “Maybe Ash is right and the door is stuck.” The words popped out of me, and the Salamanders closest to us turned back to stare at me. Worm shit, I had to learn to keep my mouth shut. Peta stood up, her front paws on top of my head.\n\n“I think that’s exactly what has happened. You need to get up there, you two.”\n\nReluctantly I pushed my way forward through the crowd. Easily enough, they parted around Ash and me as though we were diseased.\n\nThe front of the crowd was Maggie, Fiametta, and Cactus who was shaking his head almost violently.\n\n“I can’t reach that side of my powers, my queen. I’m sorry,” Cactus said. Fiametta’s frame shook and at first I thought perhaps she was angry. It was only when I saw her face that I realized she was crying.\n\nThe queen of fire, hard as all the granite in the world was crying.\n\nFiametta saw me, her blue eyes shimmering with tears. “And you two, can you open the mountain?”\n\nAsh stepped forward first, laying his hands on the large black door. I knew what lay outside, an orchard of cherry trees forever in blossom with the heat of the mountain. Ash’s arms showed nothing, no lines of power, no traces of green. He shook his head. “I’m sorry.”\n\nNow, my turn. I stepped forward reaching for the power of the earth even as it slid away from me. Teeth gritted, I put my hands on the door and bowed my head.\n\nVoices behind me rippled over my ears. What’s she doing? Does she really think we would trust her? Their words were the fuel I needed, the anger at their distrust flowed through me and I reached for my connection to the earth. The power flared and I pushed it into the door, spreading it wide with a grinding screech.\n\nI let go of the door and it immediately began to swing closed. Grabbing hold of my power once more I drove it into the door a second time. Sweat broke out on my head as I held it. In front of me were the cherry trees, the scent of their blossoms blowing into the tunnel along with a few loose petals that scattered around my feet.\n\n“Hurry, get them through!” I yelled. Peta clung to me, her nose in my ear."

        "content": "“What’s happening?”\n\nThrough gritted teeth, I spoke as the door groaned. “Someone is pushing the doors closed as I’m holding them open.” There was only one person it could be: that female in the black cloak, Blackbird’s lackey.\n\nClosing my eyes, I held the doors, my entire body shaking with the effort. A hand touched my arm.\n\n“Let it go, Lark,” Ash said.\n\nThey were through, that was my only thought as I relaxed my hold on the door. It slammed shut with a thunderous boom that shook the walls.\n\nBreathing hard I put my hands on my knees for a moment before straightening and turning around. I stared at the scene in front of me. Not one Salamander less was in the group.\n\n“What the hell is wrong with you? Why didn’t you go through?”\n\n“How can we trust you?” Maggie said, putting her face right into mine. “You could have crumbled the archway on top us as we walked through.”\n\nThere was more than a murmuring of assent more like a roar of agreement.\n\nThe mother goddess’s words about my father came back to me. Fear would stop people from trusting even those who only wanted to help them.\n\n“You all just signed your own death warrants,” I said softly, fatigue hitting me hard. Or maybe it wasn’t fatigue, but sorrow, an ache that even when I tried I wasn’t able to help them. Because deep down, no matter how much they hurt me or treated me like worm shit, I couldn’t stand by and watch them die.\n\nFiametta motioned for me to follow her a few steps away. For the first time, her eyes showed the strain she was under. “Larkspur, I will beg if I must. I cannot stop the lava flows.”\n\nI frowned at her, anger building once more. “You could have made them go through the doorway. You could have been the first one through and shown them the way out and this would now not even be a discussion.”\n\nHer face was carefully blank. “You are right.”\n\nMy eyebrows shot up. “Little late for that, don’t you think?”\n\nHer lips pursed and then softened, but there was no time for her to answer me. Behind us came the cries of her people and the splashing of lava as it reached the back of the line. People pushed forward, screaming, crying, and begging.\n\nI was jammed against the door along with Fiametta. They would take the doorway now . . . if I could open it.\n\nFear raced along my synapses as I put my hands on the slick back material once more. There was no room for anger inside the fear that snapped through me, biting at every thought and breath I had.\n\n“Peta, help me,” I whispered. “I can’t reach the earth unless I’m angry.”\n\n“Ash,” she called out, “Cactus, get over here.”\n\nThe two men pushed through, climbing over people to get to me. Screams echoed up the tunnel as the lava kissed at the heels of those at the back.\n\nAsh and Cactus crouched beside me. “What do you need us to do?”\n\nPeta curled tighter around my neck. “Show her you trust her. That is the key to breaking through these final bonds she carries.”\n\nCactus didn’t hesitate, but wrapped his arms around me from his side, pressing his lips into my hair. “I trust you to save us, Lark. You can do this.”\n\nFrom my right side, Ash placed his hands over mine. “Larkspur, you truly are the best of us, don’t doubt it.”\n\nShaking, I closed my eyes, tried to block the sounds of people being burned alive as I dug into the part of me that held my powers. Spirit and Earth bound together, a bundle of strength I’d never truly tapped into.\n\nTears streaked my face as I fought to reach them, struggled to get past the blocks put in place by Cassava and an old anger burned through me.\n\n“No,” Peta said. “Let the anger go and hold to the trust and love. That is your way now, Lark. That is the only way.”\n\nThe warmth of Cactus, the belief of Ash and support of Peta swirled through me and I suddenly understood. The strength I had would change things no matter how I used it, but I had a choice. Just like Blackbird.\n\nFor good or for ill, how would my power be seen?\n\nThe earth’s strength roared through me like never before and I flooded the door with it, blasting it apart and sending the one who would hold it against me flying away. On my knees, with my eyes closed, the rushing of the Salamanders as they flew by me no longer caring who I was, the world seemed to speak to me. Two words, but they meant everything to me.\n\nWell done.\n\nNot the mother goddess though, but a male voice, one I didn’t recognize. I slowly opened my eyes in time to see Fiametta stride through the opening. She stopped on the other side. “Hurry, the lava is right behind you.”\n\nHer words snapped me out of the headspace I’d been in. I glanced behind to see the lava creeping along the tunnel, glowing its fierce red like the eyes of a demon. I put a hand on Peta.\n\n“The children,” I said. “We can’t leave them to Blackbird. They were his back-up plan, I’m sure of it. And now he has a reason to use them.”\n\nCactus pulled back from me. “The children are alive? Can we get to them?”\n\nI nodded and stood, a feeling of surety falling over me.\n\n“We have to.”\n\nWith a flick of my wrist, I pulled the doorway down, plunging us back into the semi gloom of the lava-filling tunnel.\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\nThe lava crept toward us and I faced it head on. “Blackbird, I know you hear me. I don’t care what your game is, but I want those children. All of them, both wyrm and Salamander.”"

        "content": "A low rumbling laugh filled the air and a dark figure approached us, walking along the top of the lava. The ring he wore obviously protected him from the heat as if he were a Salamander in truth. “Little Larkspur, you lied to me. You said you would leave and I would have Fia to myself. But here you are, standing between her and me. Shame on you.”\n\nMy jaw twitched. “You can have her for all I care, but you can’t be killing children. That I won’t stand for.”\n\n“Well, good thing they’re tucked away then. I’d hate for you to be angry with me.” He stopped about twenty feet from us, right at the edge of the lava and leaned forward putting a hand to the side of his face. “The little ones, they will make perfect bargaining chips, you see?”\n\nHe lifted his other hand. “But you are in my way, I didn’t want to do this, but I will kill you and your friends.” The lava surged forward and I flung my hands up, the earth exploding in front of us. Below my feet the mountain trembled and I gave a soft apology as I drove a hole downward, tunneling as far as I could. The lava flowed into the hole, splashing at the edges.\n\nBlackbird, if that was even really his name, tipped his head to one side. “Worked past your blocks, did you? Clever girl.”\n\nHe held his hands out and lines of green flowed up from his hands to his shoulders. So he really was connected to the earth as well. Spirit, earth, water and holding a ring that gave him a connection to fire. But I saw what he was going to do and I held my hands out above us, just stopping him.\n\nThe ceiling above us groaned and the weight of the mountain pushed down on me from above.\n\nCactus let out a low whisper. “Shit, he’s going to squash us like bugs.”\n\nPeta trembled. “He is an abomination.”\n\nSweat dripped down my arms as I held the mountain back. Gravity was on the bastard’s side, though, and that tipped things in his favor. A sharp wind snapped through the cavern, throwing all four of us back against the rubble of the door. My concentration broke for a split second and the rocks began to fall in earnest.\n\nI couldn’t think of anything to do other than to get farther away from the ceiling. “Hang on!” I yelled as I opened the earth below us, dropping us into a slide as I smoothed the ground around us turning it into a slope that allowed us to fall without freefalling. Above, the rocks tumbled, and a few slid down the slope with us. Pushing my power out ahead like a burrowing mole, I was able to keep us out of the worst of it.\n\nTumbling to a stop, I looked around, or tried to. We were in complete and utter darkness.\n\n“Cactus?”\n\n“I’m here,” he answered.\n\nI tried to stand but ended up whacking my head. “Ash, talk to me.”\n\nA low groan from my left turned me around. I scuttled forward, my hands finding Ash quickly. “Are you injured?”\n\n“No, just banged up,” he said.\n\nThe walls around us rumbled and I froze, my hands tangling with Ash’s. Peta let out a meow, as she clung to my shoulder. “Lark, you truly are going to be the death of me aren’t you?”\n\nI reached for my power, reveling in the fact I could hold it tightly even though our situation was rather dire.\n\nRock and dirt sprayed around us, and I could suddenly see. A white-scaled head curled toward me. Amethyst eyes glowed as he blew a low stream of fire from his nostrils to light our space. Cactus was covered in dirt, as was Ash. Peta looked actually, not too bad.\n\n“Scar, how did you find us?”\n\n“Heartbeats, I can find yours easily as it beats louder than any other. Come on, I can get you out of here,” he said and turned around, tunneling away from us. I scrambled after him. Cactus and Ash hollered at me to stop, to think about what I was doing.\n\nPeta dropped off my shoulder and scooted ahead of me. “Do you really think you can trust him?”\n\n“If he’d wanted to hurt me, he could have let me fall when I was thrown off that damn ledge.” I crawled as fast as I could on hands and knees, and still Scar was leaving me in the dust. The tunnel wasn’t completely dark as Scar blew fire ahead.\n\nThe light grew brighter as the tunnel widened, large enough I could stand. I waited for Cactus and Ash to catch up before moving forward.\n\nWhat opened in front of me was nothing short of breathtaking. The cavern was shaped like a giant bowl with tunnels branching off in a myriad of places, but that wasn’t all that different from what the Salamanders had set up. It was the deep, pool of water in the middle of the bowl surrounded by plant life and small chirping birds I heard even from my position way above.\n\n“This is amazing,” I whispered. Scar poked his head up over the ledge.\n\n“Are you coming? My father wants me to lead you to the tunnel that will take you back into the lizard caves.”\n\nI slipped over the edge, Peta leapt to my shoulder with a grunt, and I shimmied down the wall before Cactus or Ash had time to protest. I looked up to see them both staring down at me. They shared a glance between them. Ash shook his head and Cactus shrugged.\n\nPeta’s tail flicked me in the face. “Pay attention to the wall you are climbing, not the men.”\n\nI focused on where my hands and feet were going, placing them carefully until I felt the wall open up again. Using just my arms I carefully lowered myself the rest of the way and swung into the open hole.\n\nScar sat on his haunches, waiting for me. Cactus and Ash dropped in a few seconds later. The young firewyrm gave Cactus a sidelong glance. “You can only take your familiar with you. The others have to wait here.”"

        "content": "I put my hands on my hips. “Take her with me where? What are you talking about?”\n\nScar flicked his head over his shoulder, his tongue darting out and tasting the air. “This tunnel leads to the throne room where the cloaked ones are currently discussing how to wipe out all of us. They have the children deep in the dungeons.”\n\n“Then why doesn’t your father go get them?” I asked, stepping up beside him.\n\n“Because whenever we get close to the cloaked ones we lose our memory of what we do. That is why we’ve been attacking the Salamanders. We didn’t want to, they were making us.” Scar shook his head. “You are the only one who can go in, Spirit Walker. The males must stay here if they are to be safe; they could be forced to hurt you too.”\n\nI translated quickly for the two men, relaying what Scar had said.\n\n“No, we aren’t leaving her.” Cactus shook his head.\n\nAsh nodded to me and said, “Understood.”\n\nCactus stared at him. “You would leave her to do this on her own?”\n\n“She has to. What if the other Spirit Walker takes control of you, makes you fight her? What is she supposed to do then?” Ash shook his head. “I know all too well how hard it is to fight the compulsion, and the only way to break it is to be touching Lark physically. How do we fight when we can’t let go of one another?”\n\nAsh’s words made total sense. Cactus was still not convinced. “Then how come Peta can go?”\n\nPeta sniffed. “I’m her familiar. I’m protected by Lark’s abilities, Prick.”\n\n“No more arguing, the longer this takes the more chance we have of them escaping,” I said. I didn’t look back, just walked away. There was a grunt and the sound of bodies hitting the ground.\n\n“Lark, don’t do this, they’ll kill you,” Cactus called out. I straightened my back and kept walking.\n\nPeta swayed on my shoulder. “How little faith he has.”\n\n“No, I don’t think it’s a matter of faith.” I followed the shimmering white scales of Scar’s back. “I think it’s a matter of love.”\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\nThe tunnel Scar took me through opened outside the main doors of the throne room where the firewyrm etched into them seemed to wink at us. I was flat on my belly, barely able to squeeze through. The two large statues were directly in front of us and we were concealed behind the queen’s flared skirts. Ironic that she’d been hiding the tunnel all along.\n\n“Good luck, Spirit walker,” Scar said as he backed away from me, disappearing back the way we’d come. In the semi darkness, the entrance was invisible, perfectly disguised.\n\nPeta shifted to her snow leopard form and padded ahead of me. Her rounded ears swiveled back and forth as she tipped her head to one side in front of the doors. “There is only one left in the room,” she whispered.\n\nSwallowing whatever trepidation I had, I eased the door open a crack and peered in. The smaller of the two cloaked figures sat on the throne, drumming her fingers on the arm rest.\n\n“I will be queen here and this time no one will stop me,” she snapped into the air and the words echoed around. Sliding from the throne she strode forward, her cloak swirling out behind her as she slapped her hands on her thighs. Everything she did looked familiar, like someone I’d . . .\n\n“Cassava,” I whispered. That was whom she reminded me off. Her inflections of words, the way she walked, and that thigh slapping. All were idiosyncrasies of my stepmother.\n\nShe walked away from me, heading to the far side of the room in the opposite direction of the dungeons. I had a choice. I could follow her and see what she was doing, or I could go after the children.\n\n“Peta, get the kids, lead them through the tunnel. Can you do that?”\n\n“I can. But then you will go after her alone, won’t you?” Her green eyes crinkled with concern around the edges. “Won’t you?”\n\nI wouldn’t lie to her. “Yes, but I’ve stopped her before, I can do it again. Just hurry. Get those kids out.”\n\nPeta slipped through the door ahead of me and slunk toward the dungeon as I hurried after Cassava. The door to Fiametta’s personal rooms was ajar. I peered through. Cassava was flinging things everywhere, searching . . .for what? Whatever it was Fiametta had hidden. Whatever her ex-lover Coal had been searching for. He must have been working for Cassava and Blackbird.\n\n“Damn you, Fiametta, where did you hide it?” She grabbed the mattress and flipped it off its supports. Taking a swing with one foot, she kicked at a vase to the left of the bed, shattering it. Glass went everywhere, and I saw what she was looking for. Glass pieces settled into the faintest of depressions in the floor. A very subtle handle.\n\nThe only problem was, she saw it the same time that I did. I burst into the room as she opened the secret compartment.\n\n“No!” I screamed startling her.\n\nIt wasn’t enough though. Her hand dove into the hole and came out with a necklace with a big fat emerald teardrop hanging from it.\n\n“It’s mine!” She tipped her head back and howled the words.\n\nThe lines of power ran a deep dark green up her arms as she yanked the earth out from under me. Or tried to. I saw her intention and scrambled backward, all the way into the throne room. She stalked out after me, the emerald hanging around her neck.\n\n“You aren’t strong enough to stop me now, Larkspur. Not when I hold this.” She said, touching the large emerald."

        "content": "“Doesn’t mean I’m just going to roll over you dumb cow.” I swung my spear out. “Last I checked, you couldn’t fight worth shit.”\n\nHer whole body stiffened. “How do you know who I am?”\n\n“I’m no fool, I would know you if my eyes were closed, bitch.” I circled her, watching, waiting for her to use the depth of power she carried.\n\nThe flicker of green at her fingertips and the slight softening of the ground below was the only warning I had. I leapt at her, spear raised and swinging through the air in a perfect arc as the footing below me dropped away.\n\nShe squealed like a stuck pig and scrambled backward, flinging her hands at me, the lines of power going wild over her entire body. It was too much, even for her. The earth exploded through the golden floor, rocks and gemstones flying everywhere. One caught me on the back of my hand, numbing my fingers and making me drop my spear. I landed on top of her and rolled us both across the floor.\n\nPhysically I knew she couldn’t beat me.\n\nA blast of wind smashed into me, tearing me off her, tearing my fingers away from where I’d gripped her cloak. I was thrown hard and pinned against the far wall. I stared at Blackbird.\n\nHis body hummed with power, all five colors swirling. Red, blue, white, green and pink.\n\n“Mother goddess have mercy,” I whispered. He carried all five elements, he was the child Requiem had wanted to produce with his breeding program. “How are you even possible?”\n\nThe question slipped out of me, unbidden as my mind tried to make sense of the impossibility of what he was. He shrugged.\n\n“I have no say in who made me. I was born though, I can assure you of that.” He tossed his ruby ring to Cassava. “Here, use this and kill her. I am off to the Eyrie. I expect you to clean this mess up and take control.”\n\nCassava nodded, shocking me. She was taking orders from him? He bent down and kissed her on the top of her head. “Do not disappoint me.”\n\n“I won’t.”\n\nHe walked away, humming to himself as he wove all five elements around his body. Five, even without the use of the ring. As he disappeared, I dropped to the ground.\n\nCassava crept toward me. “You are finally going to get what you deserve, you stupid half breed. And then I will be queen here.”\n\n“Big words coming from someone who is bowing to an abomination,” I said, keeping my voice even. This was not the time to panic.\n\nShe lifted her hands and fire raced from her fingertips to light up the wall around me. The heat was instant, sweat popping out along my bare skin.\n\nMaybe this was the time to panic.\n\nI pulled the earth upward, dousing the flames, but she ignited them as fast as I put them out. Flinging her left hand, the ceiling collapsed on top of me and instantly lit on fire. I pushed the rock off, but the fire crept closer, igniting my hair in places, singeing my clothes.\n\n“This can only end one way, half breed,” she laughed, “and that will be with me dancing on your grave.”\n\nI had only one option left, I had to use Spirit to stop her. I called that power forth as the fire super heated around me, gold melting into puddles on the floor. I put everything I had into directing Spirit toward her. It’s essence wove through me, melding with the beat of my heart, the thrum of my own blood pumping in my veins as I focused on breaking her hold on the two elements.\n\n“Stop!” I yelled at her.\n\nHer feet stumbled to a stop and she went to her knees.\n\n“You will not harm me or anyone else ever again!” I said, and even to myself my voice reverberated. I kept pushing Spirit into her, fear driving me. Waves of Spirit crashed out of me and into her and for a moment I thought she would fall down. Her body went slack, and she dropped to her knees.\n\nShe lifted her hands and the fire went out. “No harm, no harm, no harm.”\n\nSpirit danced along my synapses, humming softly, a steady warmth that felt so good. A sigh of relief slipped out of me. It was over without anyone being hurt. If I didn’t count the burns and bruises on my body.\n\nI walked over to her as I released my hold on Spirit.\n\nThere was a pull within my own soul, like something took a long drink of me. It was there and gone so fast I wasn’t sure I hadn’t imagined it. I sagged for a split second then stood up straight, forcing my body to obey me no matter how badly it wanted to lay down and rest. I would not look weak in front of Cassava. I strode toward her, my legs like jelly.\n\n“You might as well take the cloak off now. It’s not like you’re hiding from anyone.”\n\nCassava didn’t move; she stood like a statue. Defiant to the end.\n\n“Take the damn cloak off,” I snapped and still she ignored me. “Fine, do whatever you like. Father will deal with you soon enough.” I didn’t dare take my eyes off her for fear she would suddenly grab at one of the powers open to her.\n\nWith that in mind, I darted forward and jerked both away from her. She didn’t protest, barely even flinched as I took both the emerald and the ruby, tucking them under my vest.\n\nNo reaction at all. What was going on? Why wasn’t she at least saying something?\n\nThe doors to the throne room creaked open and I glanced quickly to see Peta creeping in.\n\n“It’s safe. She’s taken care of,” I said, motioning to Cassava. “Actually, she’s playing some kind of game here. Won’t talk, won’t respond to anything I say.”\n\nPeta sniffed the air. “I still can’t smell her. Can you take that cloak off?”\n\nI reached out and grabbed the cloak . . . or tried to. It dissolved as my hand passed through it, as if it never were. The cloak vanished and what I was seeing couldn’t have stunned me more."

        "content": "Shock hit me like a lightning bolt and I stumbled backward. “No, no it can’t be.”\n\nIn front of me stood not Cassava but my younger sister, Keeda. Her mouth was slack and her brown eyes empty of any emotion, long tendrils of dark brown hair flowed around her face. She looked like a doll, empty and vacant of any sort of life. The ticks I’d seen her, so like Cassava, they were just a daughter’s habits learned at her mother’s knee.\n\nQueen . . . she’d been fighting to be queen here.\n\nI struggled to breathe and ended up on my knees in front of her as tears trickled down my cheeks. Peta moved to my side. “You used Spirit on her, didn’t you?”\n\n“Yes,” I whispered. “What have I done?”\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\nPeta let out a sigh as she drew closer to me. “My first charge, he learned to use Spirit, but it is tricky. A powerful tool. When you use it without really knowing, it can burn someone else out.”\n\n“Burn them out?” I stared at my little sister, the blank gaze in her eyes, the dribble of drool falling from her lips. I’d done that. I’d destroyed her mind. “Can it be reversed?”\n\n“I don’t think so.” Peta butted her head against me but I pulled away. I didn’t deserve any comfort. I stood and walked to Keeda.\n\n“We’ve got to get her out of here and back home. Maybe Niah can help, she knows more than she lets on.” Niah was a storyteller in the Rim, but she also knew a lot about things most Terralings had forgotten. Legends, myths, stories that seemed impossible yet were not.\n\n“Perhaps,” Peta said, but I knew she only spoke the word I wanted to hear.\n\nPeta turned and walked away, leading the way. I hooked an arm through Keeda’s and tugged on her. She took a step in the direction I urged.\n\nWe reached the wide doors, stepped through and the skin on the back of my neck prickled. I spun and looked back into the throne room.\n\nNo one was there, no one I could see. And yet I felt eyes on me. I looked up at the doors.\n\nAll who enter shall be judged, and those found lacking shall be destroyed.\n\nWas that what had happened, some sort of judgment? I looked away from the words, feeling them burn into my soul. Destroyed, that was how I felt, like a piece of me had been pulled apart and smashed in front of my face. Peta shrunk to her housecat form and slipped into the tunnel behind the statues that would lead us back to the firewyrms. I pushed Keeda ahead of me and she went willingly.\n\nMother goddess, what had I done? What kind of monster was I?\n\nWe emerged into the opening where the firewyrms, Cactus, and Ash waited.\n\nExcept they weren’t the only ones. The missing children were there too. Tinder saw me, his eyes sparkling with mischief. Waving wildly, he ran to greet us.\n\n“Terraling, the bad luck cat saved us. I couldn’t believe it when I saw her, but she saved us.”\n\nPeta gave a low grumble, but through our bond her pleasure was a warmth that spread through to me. She leaned out and gave Tinder’s face a lick. “You’re welcome, little lizard.”\n\nAsh strode forward, took one look at Keeda and sucked in a sharp breath. “What happened to her?”\n\nI shook my head, unable to say the words, hiding my shame behind a wall of silence. Cactus looked from me to Keeda and back again and my face burned. He would figure it out if anyone would. But he said nothing about her.\n\nHolding Keeda by the arm, I drew her forward. “I have to get her home.”\n\nCactus nodded but he wouldn’t make eye contact with me.\n\nThe firewyrms took us to a tunnel that led back to the entranceway. Peta went first then Ash. The seven children, including Tinder, piled in after him, excited and chattering like they hadn’t been abducted and kept in a dungeon for hours. Resilient little hearts was the only thought I had for them.\n\nI guided Keeda ahead of me, and Cactus brought up the rear, a faint glow of fire over his left hand. Each Salamander child also held a tiny glow above their hands, lighting the tunnel with ease. At least they could reach their element with Keeda and her cohort gone. I hoped that meant they—and the other Salamanders—were finally safe.\n\nThe tunnel was big enough for us to walk without crouching, but only in single file, which made it easy for me to ignore Cactus’s attempts to talk to me. Three times he tugged at my arm and cleared his throat. Each time I pushed forward a little faster until Keeda was on top of Ash.\n\nAsh glared back at me after the third pushing incident. “Lark, hurrying at this point isn’t going to help anyone.”\n\nHe was right, but I still didn’t want to explain what happened to Cactus so when he reached for me a fourth time, I jerked my arm away from him. “I don’t want to talk.”\n\n“I just want to hold your hand, Lark. To know you really are here and we’re getting out,” he said softly.\n\nShame burned me through and through. I reached back for him and he laced his fingers with mine. A soft warmth cascaded through me and eased some of the heartache that hummed within my body. Still though, my mind would not let me forget what I’d done.\n\nI’d destroyed my sister’s soul. She and I were not close, and it was obvious that she was taking after her mother. That didn’t negate the fact that she was a hollowed out creature, her body intact and her soul missing. My control—or in this case lack of control—over Spirit had done that.\n\nAnother minute passed and we were out of the tunnel and in front of the broken doorway. The children ran around, darting like large fireflies in a game of tag. Ash opened his mouth and I knew him well enough to know what was going to come out. He would tell them to settle down, to be serious, and fall in line."

        "content": "“Let them play,” I said softly. “Let them be children.”\n\nHis eyes met mine and he gave me a slow nod. Then he held his hand up and the rocks blocking the doorway shifted so we could slip into the open air.\n\nNight had fallen, and the moon was high above our heads giving a soft ethereal tone to the cherry trees and the ever-falling blossoms.\n\nThe stillness was broken by the cries of the children as they were reunited with their families, the sobs of mothers and fathers as their little ones, thought gone forever, returned to them.\n\nI put a hand on Peta’s back. “Good job, bad luck cat. You did that for them, I think now they will have to give you a new nickname.”\n\nPeta snorted softly, but said nothing.\n\nFiametta strode toward us, her eyes going straight to Keeda.\n\n“Who is this?”\n\nNo choice now, I had to come up with a lie she would believe. “This is my sister, she was imprisoned by the one who blocked your element and stole control of the lava from you.”\n\nFiametta leaned in and then sucked in a sharp gasp. “Her soul is gone.”\n\nLike a punch to the gut I tried to breathe around sharp dig of pain. I’d done that, I’d stolen my sister’s soul. Goddess, how could I ever fix this? “It happened in the battle.”\n\nFiametta was talking, a blur of words. Something about being heroes, or judging all Terralings by a few, or giving us a hero’s send off. I didn’t really hear much of it, just nodded and smiled while my heart and mind reeled.\n\nI’d stolen a soul.\n\nI was a monster.\n\n“What can we offer you, in thanks for saving us?” Fiametta said, her words finally snapping me out of the fog I’d fallen in.\n\n“Stop killing the firewyrms. Make peace with them. They could have left us all to die, they didn’t have to help, and yet they did,” I said, mulling over my words and then just going with it. “Like us. We could have left you to fight this battle on your own but we didn’t. Because we are family, and no matter how much we fight, we need each other in this world.”\n\nThe Salamanders around us nodded, and my words were quickly passed through the crowd.\n\n“Family,” Fiametta said softly. “That is a word I have not applied to the other elements for many years. Yet perhaps you are right. Call on me, Larkspur, if you have need, and I will call you cousin in truth. I swear on the soul of my unborn child that I will send aid if you ask for it.”\n\nUnborn child. I raised an eyebrow at her. “There is one more thing. Cactus is coming with me.”\n\nFiametta’s eyes narrowed.\n\nI gave her a tight smile. “You don’t need him now, if you make peace with the firewyrms.”\n\nBeside me Cactus tensed, no doubt expecting her to command him to stay. But despite her hard ass nature, he’d been right about her. She wasn’t an evil bitch like Cassava, just a very tough woman.\n\n“So be it. But I will miss him.”\n\n“I will visit.” He grinned at her, and her lips twitched with what might have been a smile.\n\nI held my hand out to her, tapping two fingers across the top of my hand in the way that they showed recognition of someone stronger than themselves. “Thank you, and may the mother goddess be with you and all your children.”\n\nThere was nothing left to say, and within a few minutes we were all inside the mountain once more. Fresh air replaced the heavy heat of the receding lava flows. The Salamanders were already putting things back into place, and the lava had returned to its bubbling river.\n\nHomes were destroyed and personal items had been burned up in the flooding lava, yet even I could see that the damage was not complete.\n\nBlackbird had to have been directing the flow of the lava all along, chasing the Salamanders. There were areas of the living quarters completely untouched.\n\nI wondered how long it would be before any of them truly trusted their element again and willingly stepped into the lava for a swim.\n\nFiametta directed her people, encouraging them to help those who’d lost everything. To share what they had. She even put one family into her private quarters while their home was rebuilt. I had to give it to her, she was a better queen than I’d thought. Still a hard ass, but a good leader.\n\nPerhaps I just brought out the best in her. Peta snorted on my shoulder, picking up on my thoughts. “Not likely.”\n\nCactus, free from the hold Fiametta had on him went to the middle of the living area, beckoning me. “Will you help me?”\n\nI went to him. “What do you want me to do?”\n\n“Let’s show them just what a Terraling is made of, yes?”\n\nAt first I didn’t understand, until the first curl of green lines rose up his arms and the shoots of grass erupted under our feet. Nodding, I held my hands out and tapped into the earth. With my eyes closed I imagined a garden loaded with fruit and blossoms, vegetables, and living plants of all varieties. The power flowed out of me with ease and the air around us cooled.\n\nOpening my eyes, I struggled not to gasp at what we’d created. An oasis in the middle of a desert was the only thought I had. Exotic trees that could withstand the heat towered over us, and the ground was soft with soil that would encourage growth.\n\nWe’d changed the very makeup of the Pit. At least in this one place.\n\nFiametta came to us in the oasis. “Cactus, why didn’t you do this before?” The awe in her voice was rather gratifying.\n\nHe shrugged. “Most of this isn’t me. This is Larkspur. I just gave her the idea. Most Terralings could barely get a shoot to grow in this heat . . . she gave you a paradise.” He winked at me as I gaped back at him."

        "content": "I’d done all of it?\n\nFiametta looked to me. “Then I will give you something in return. The truth.” She let out a slow breath. “I know the Enders were not killed by your hand, Larkspur. I’ve known all along that Blackbird did it. He told me himself in one of his forays into my bedroom. But I needed you. Finley told me how you saved her people when you didn’t have to and I . . . I wanted to believe you could do the same here. And while I perhaps went about it the wrong way, I was right. You did save us.”\n\nIf I thought my jaw had dropped before it was nothing to what it did then.\n\n“You knew.”\n\nTwo bright spots of color emerged on her pale cheeks. “I did. I am . . .sorry.”\n\nPeta bumped her head against mine. “Take it, Lark. You will never hear those words again from her.”\n\nSwallowing the remnants of my anger at the Pit’s queen, I held out my hand in the gesture of greeting. Fiametta brushed her palm over mine.\n\n“I have no guarantee that Blackbird won’t come back. He stole something of mine. A powerful tool.” The queen said.\n\nDamn, she meant the emerald. Sweating, I could feel the stone against my skin. Was that why I’d been able to pull so much power and create the oasis? I had no doubt it was the stone that allowed the user to connect with the earth.\n\nFiametta continued. “ . . . I will work with the firewyrms. Perhaps between our two people, we can find a way to protect ourselves against the power of Spirit. But if we don’t . . .” her blue eyes all but nailed me to the spot, “I will call on you again. And because we are friends now, you will come.”\n\nDamn. Friends? There was nothing for me to do but nod until Peta piped up.\n\n“And she can do the same. Call on you for help if she needs it.”\n\nFiametta surprised me by smiling. “Of course.”\n\nCactus touched my arm. “I think we should go.”\n\nThe ruby ring. I closed my eyes for a moment and slipped my hand under my vest pulling the ring out. “I took this off Keeda. Blackbird gave it to her.”\n\nFiametta gasped and with a trembling hand took the ring. “Do you know what this is?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And you would give it to me?”\n\nPeta purred softly, obviously pleased with my decision. “Who better to care for it than the one who carries the same element?”\n\nSurprising me, she swept me into a hug. “I am so sorry I misjudged you, Larkspur.”\n\nGoddess, I didn’t want to like her. “I saw it in your eyes when you lashed me.”\n\nShe pulled back. “I did not want to do it, but I saw no other way out. I have to uphold the law. Always.”\n\nThere was a soft cough and we turned to see her black panther walking toward us. “Fia,” he said, “there is such a thing as the spirit of the law, and the letter of the law. You have yet to learn both have power.”\n\nShe looked away from him and I put a hand on her. “You should listen to him. The only reason I survived is because I took Peta’s advice. Your familiar . . . if he cares for you even half as much as Peta cares for me, you are in good hands.”\n\nPeta tucked her head against my neck, hiding her face. “Larkspur, how can you know that?”\n\nFiametta’s face tightened and I thought for a moment she would ignore me. She held a hand out to Jag. “Come, be at my side, pet.” He butted his head into her outstretched hand, a deep rumble of contentment slipping out of him.\n\nThe queen gave me one last nod. “Cactus is right, it is time for you to go.”\n\nWe backed away, each giving her a bow before we turned and headed to the Traveling room.\n\nNo words were spoken, too much had happened in those last minutes.\n\nThe Traveling room was still intact, whatever magic that kept the globe spinning and moving in time with the real world had kept it from collapsing under the heat.\n\nAsh handed me an armband as Brand, Smoke, and their three boys entered the room. Smoke gathered me into her arms.\n\n“Bless you, Larkspur. You saved my boy. I know Peta helped, but she wouldn’t have if you hadn’t been there.” She kissed me on both cheeks and then the lips. “You are always welcome in our home.” She put a hand on Peta’s head. “Both of you.”\n\nPeta fairly glowed with pride. Tinder scooped her up and hugged her against his body and she licked his nose. Stryker and Cano tapped their fingers across my hand before backing away.\n\nBrand hugged me with one arm. “Thank you.” Just two words, but they held the weight of what almost happened. If he’d gone into the lava, Smoke would still have lost one of her men.\n\nI gave him a tight nod. “Anytime.”\n\nKeeda stood beside me, and Tinder handed me Peta who curled up on my shoulder.\n\n“I can’t Travel with more than one person,” I said. Peta snorted.\n\n“I’m a part of you, I don’t count as a separate being.”\n\nThat was news to me, but I didn’t question her. Brand, Smoke, and their boys waved to us from the doorway as we engaged the armbands and the world of the Pit slid into nothing.\n\nMy hand was clamped around Keeda and for a moment, I thought I would see nothing, that her memories would be gone along with her soul.\n\nYet, that wasn’t the case in the least.\n\nCHAPTER 26\n\nThe throne room was everything she ever wanted: a golden throne, golden floors and ceiling, gemstones everywhere. This was where she would be queen. A smile lifted her lips as she checked the spell that held her cloaking ability in place."

        "content": "Simple, it was so simple to take the essence of her element and dilute it so the magic was not a power connected to the earth, but a pure power she could use for spells. Not all that different from a supernatural. The smile slipped as the burns on the fronts of her thighs cracked. She’d gone too close to the Pit and had to steal ointment from the healer’s rooms a second time.\n\nSoon though she wouldn’t have to sneak anywhere. She’d just make a demand and someone would get her what she wanted.\n\nAs she ripped through Fiametta’s things, her mind wandered. Why did they have to kill Larkspur anyway? She was a weak half breed with nothing to offer. Why couldn’t Mother see that?\n\nNot that it mattered, she would kill her sister and then be done with that chapter of her life. Mother would be so pleased. Perhaps she would come see her coronation as the new queen of the Pit. She could just imagine her mother smiling, proud of her youngest daughter for doing what none of her other children had managed. Kill the half breed and take a throne in one fell swoop.\n\nThe memory busted apart as we stumbled into the Traveling room within the Rim. No one was waiting for us. I shook my head, trying to orient myself and push Keeda’s memory away. Perhaps her soul wasn’t gone, but just tucked away deep within her. Because how could a memory exist where there was no soul to power it?\n\nCactus drew in a deep breath beside me. “I can’t tell you how good it feels to be home.”\n\nAsh clapped him on the shoulder. “I’m glad you’re here. Perhaps between the two of us we, can keep Lark out of trouble for more than a day or two.”\n\nThe two men laughed, but I didn’t join them. Now home, there were things I had to take care of. Primarily a missing father and the missing soul of my sister. No matter how bad she was, I couldn’t leave her in that state.\n\n“Ash, take Keeda to the healer and call for Niah. See if she can help with what I did to her,” I barked the order out as I made for the door. “Cactus, go with him.”\n\nCactus grunted. “Bossy, isn’t she?”\n\n“You have no idea,” Ash answered.\n\nPeta growled at them both. I ran up the stairs and into the main Enders barracks. The room was silent, but of course it was early enough in the day that even the Enders wouldn’t necessarily be up.\n\nThe farther I got from the Traveling room, the faster my feet took me until I was full out sprinting across the small distance between the barracks and the Spiral, my family’s home and the seat of my father’s rule.\n\nThe guard on duty at the main doors stared at me with wide eyes and an upraised sword. At first I didn’t recognize her, with her hair cut short enough to leave nothing to be pulled back. Even the sides were shaved.\n\n“Blossom,” I said her name and she lowered her sword.\n\n“Lark, you’re back.”\n\n“Is Belladonna here?”\n\nShe nodded. “Yes, go on up. She left orders that when you came home you were to be taken to her right away. But . . . how did you get away? We all thought she was off her rocker thinking you’d escape the Pit.”\n\n“Long story, no time for it now,” I breathed out as I flung the doors open and headed for the stairs that would take me to the sleeping quarters. While this was my family’s home, I hadn’t actually lived there for years. Not since my mother, my father’s mistress, had been killed by Cassava.\n\nThere was another guard on Belladonna’s door, and I did recognize him right away. Coal.\n\n“I need to speak to my sister.\n\nSurprising the hell out of me, he didn’t question me, just stepped aside. “She’s crabby when you wake her up suddenly.”\n\nHe sported a black eye. I couldn’t help the laugh. “You tried to make a move on her?”\n\nHis eyes narrowed as I pushed through the door, shutting it tightly behind me. “Bella, wake up. I’m home.”\n\nShe sat bolt upright in bed, her hair a mess and her nightdress tangled around her body. “Lark, thank the mother goddess, you made it out. What took so long?”\n\nI let out a breath. “Long story. But before I do say anything, this is for you.” I pulled the emerald necklace out and slipped it over her head. “It will boost your connection to the earth, but you will have to practice. It is a weapon, Bella, and I am trusting it to you. Use it only to protect our family.”\n\nHer hand trembled as she took it and slipped it on. “I won’t break that trust.”\n\n“I know.” I let out another slow breath. “The Pit, the traitors there . . . Keeda was in on it.”\n\nBella gasped, a hand going to her mouth. Slowly she dropped it. “Is she alive?”\n\nI sat on the edge of the bed, finally allowing myself to feel the full weight of what happened. “Not really. I . . . burned her out.” In halting words, I explained what had happened, and what Spirit had done to our younger sister. Bella reached out and wrapped her arms around me and I let her, lowering my head to her shoulder.\n\n“I should have known better.” A sob ripped out of me. The horror of what I’d done wouldn’t leave me. I wasn’t sure I could ever close my eyes again and not see the vacant stare of my little sister looking back at me.\n\nBella held me tight. “Would you have died if you’d not used Spirit?”\n\nI mulled the question over rehashing the fight in my mind and seeing once more that there had been no other way. Peta would have been too late to help me and there was no other weapon I’d had that could have stopped Keeda from killing me. “Yes, I would have died. But I could have held back. I should have held back.”"

And you are still learning how to use Spirit. This was an accident.” She let me go. We sat in silence for a moment, a silence that I dreaded the breaking of.\n\n“I know you are worried about Keeda, but there is a larger problem. Father is still missing,” she said. “We can’t find him anywhere. We’re thinking . . . about using a Tracker to find him.”\n\nI blinked several times. “We?”\n\nShe blushed. “Okay, I was thinking of using a Tracker to find him. Your friend, Griffin, suggested it and I think he is right.”\n\n“That’s breaking rules, Bella. Rules the mother goddess put in place for a reason. We aren’t supposed to even contact those in the supernatural world, never mind seek them out.” I stared at my sister, but she was right. We had to find Father, no matter what happened.\n\nI stood. “That’s what you’re asking me, isn’t it? To find a Tracker and use them to find Father? To break the rules.”\n\nShe sat up straighter, a strange sort of royalty coming over her. “Yes, Ender Larkspur. I am asking you to do whatever you have to do to save our king. Save him, even at the expense of your own soul and the possibility of banishment. Will you do it?”\n\nI looked into her gray eyes, saw the love for our father, and the love for me as her sister.\n\nI went to one knee and bowed my head. “It will be done.”"

        "content": "Loading...\n\nA crash. Books fall to the speckled linoleum floor. They skid a few feet, whirling in circles, and stop near feet. My feet. I don’t recognize the black sandals, or the red toenails, but they move when I tell them to, so they must be mine. Right?\n\nA bell rings.\n\nShrill.\n\nI jump, my heart racing. My eyes move left to right as I scope out my environment, trying not to give myself away.\n\nWhat kind of bell was that?\n\nWhere am I?\n\nKids with backpacks walk briskly into the room, talking and laughing. A school bell. They slide into desks, their voices competing in volume. I see movement at my feet and jerk in surprise. Someone is bent over, gathering up books on the floor; a red-faced girl with glasses. Before she stands up, she looks at me with something like fear and then scurries off. People are laughing. When I look around I think they’re laughing at me, but it’s the girl with glasses they’re looking at.\n\n“Charlie!” Someone calls. “Didn’t you see that?” And then, “Charlie…what’s your problem…hello…?”\n\nMy heart is beating fast, so fast.\n\nWhere is this? Why can’t I remember?\n\n“Charlie!” someone hisses. I look around.\n\nWho is Charlie? Which one is Charlie?\n\nThere are so many kids; blond hair, ratty hair, brown hair, glasses, no glasses…\n\nA man walks in carrying a briefcase. He sets it on the desk.\n\nThe teacher. I am in a classroom, and that is the teacher. High school or college, I wonder.\n\nI stand up suddenly. I’m in the wrong place. Everyone is sitting, but I’m standing…walking.\n\n“Where are you going, miss Wynwood?” The teacher is looking at me over the rim of his glasses as he rifles through a pile of papers. He slaps them down hard on the desk and I jump. I must be miss Wynwood.\n\n“She has cramps!” Someone calls out. People snicker. I feel a chill creep up my back and crawl across the tops of my arms. They’re laughing at me, except I don’t know who these people are.\n\nI hear a girl’s voice say, “Shut up, Michael.”\n\n“I don’t know,” I say, hearing my voice for the first time. It’s too high. I clear my throat and try again. “I don’t know. I’m not supposed to be here.”\n\nThere is more laughing. I glance around at the posters on the wall, the faces of presidents animated with dates beneath them. History class? High school.\n\nThe man—the teacher—tilts his head to the side like I’ve said the dumbest thing. “And where else are you supposed to be on test day?”\n\n“I…I don’t know.”\n\n“Sit down,” he says. I don’t know where I’d go if I left. I turn around to go back. The girl with the glasses glances up at me as I pass her. She looks away almost as quickly.\n\nAs soon as I’m sitting, the teacher starts handing out papers. He walks between desks, his voice a flat drone as he tells us what percentage of our final grade the test will be. When he reaches my desk he pauses, a deep crease between his eyebrows. “I don’t know what you’re trying to pull.” He presses the tip of a fat pointer finger on my desk.\n\n“Whatever it is, I’m sick of it. One more stunt and I’m sending you to the principal’s office.” He slaps the test down in front of me and moves down the line.\n\nI don’t nod, I don’t do anything. I’m trying to decide what to do. Announce to the whole room that I have no idea who and where I am—or pull him aside and tell him quietly. He said no more stunts. My eyes move to the paper in front of me. People are already bent over their tests, pencils scratching.\n\nFOURTH PERIOD\n\nHISTORY\n\nMR. DULCOTT\n\nThere is a space for a name. I’m supposed to write my name, but I don’t know what my name is. Miss Wynwood, he called me.\n\nWhy don’t I recognize my own name?\n\nOr where I am?\n\nOr what I am?\n\nEvery head is bent over their papers except mine. So I sit and stare, straight ahead. Mr. Dulcott glares at me from his desk. The longer I sit, the redder his face becomes.\n\nTime passes and yet my world has stopped. Eventually, Mr. Dulcott stands up, his mouth open to say something to me when the bell rings. “Put your papers on my desk on the way out,” he says, his eyes still on my face. Everyone is filing out of the door. I stand up and follow them because I don’t know what else to do. I keep my eyes on the floor, but I can feel his rage. I don’t understand why he’s so angry with me. I am in a hallway now, lined on either side by blue lockers.\n\n“Charlie!” someone calls. “Charlie, wait up!” A second later, an arm loops through mine. I expect it to be the girl with the glasses; I don’t know why. It’s not. But, I know now that I am Charlie. Charlie Wynwood. “You forgot your bag,” she says, handing over a white backpack. I take it from her, wondering if there’s a wallet with a driver’s license inside. She keeps her arm looped through mine as we walk. She’s shorter than me, with long, dark hair and dewy brown eyes that take up half her face. She is startling and beautiful.\n\n“Why were you acting so weird in there?” she asks. “You knocked the shrimp’s books on the floor and then spaced out.”\n\nI can smell her perfume; it’s familiar and too sweet, like a million flowers competing for attention. I think of the girl with the glasses, the look on her face as she bent to scoop up her books. If I did that, why don’t I remember?\n\n“I-”\n\n“It’s lunch, why are you walking that way?” She pulls me down a different corridor, past more students. They all look at me…little glances. I wonder if they know me, and why I don’t know me. I don’t know why I don’t tell her, tell Mr. Dulcott, grab someone random and tell them that I don’t know who or where I am. By the time I’m seriously entertaining the idea, we’re through a set of double doors in the cafeteria. Noise and color; bodies that all have a unique smell, bright fluorescent lights that make everything look ugly. Oh, God. I clutch at my shirt.\n\nThe girl on my arm is babbling. Andrew this, Marcy that. She likes Andrew and hates Marcy. I don’t know who either of them is. She corrals me to the food line. We get salad and Diet Cokes. Then we are sliding our trays on a table. There are already people sitting there: four boys, two girls. I realize we are completing a group with even numbers. All the girls are matched with a guy. Everyone looks up at me expectantly, like I’m supposed to say something, do something. The only place left to sit is next to a guy with dark hair. I sit slowly, both hands flat on the table. His eyes dart toward me and then he bends over his tray of food. I can see the finest beads of sweat on his forehead, just below his hairline.\n\n“You two are so awkward sometimes,” says a new girl, blonde, across from me. She’s looking from me to the guy I’m sitting next to. He looks up from his macaroni and I realize he’s just moving things around on his plate. He hasn’t taken a bite, despite how busy he looks. He looks at me and I look at him, then we both look back at the blonde girl.\n\n“Did something happen that we should know about?” she asks.\n\n“No,” we say in unison.\n\nHe’s my boyfriend. I know by the way they’re treating us. He suddenly smiles at me with his brilliantly white teeth and reaches to put an arm around my shoulders.\n\nLoading..."

I automatically stiffen, but when I see the six sets of eyes on my face, I lean in and play along. It’s frightening not knowing who you are – even more frightening thinking you’ll get it wrong. I’m scared now, really scared. It’s gone too far. If I say something now I’ll look…crazy. His affection seems to make everyone relax. Everyone except…him. They go back to talking, but all the words blend together: football, a party, more football. The guy sitting next to me laughs and joins in with their conversation, his arm never straying from my shoulders. They call him Silas. They call me Charlie. The dark-haired girl with the big eyes is Annika. I forget everyone else’s names in the noise.\n\nLunch is finally over and we all get up. I walk next to Silas, or rather he walks next to me. I have no idea where I’m going. Annika flanks my free side, winding her arms through mine and chatting about cheerleading practice. She’s making me feel claustrophobic. When we reach an annex in the hallway, I lean over and speak to her so only she can hear. “Can you walk me to my next class?” Her face becomes serious. She breaks away to say something to her boyfriend, and then our arms are looped again.\n\nI turn to Silas. “Annika is going to walk me to my next class.”\n\n“Okay,” he says. He looks relieved. “I’ll see you…later.” He heads off in the opposite direction.\n\nAnnika turns to me as soon as he’s out of sight. “Where’s he going?”\n\nI shrug. “To class.”\n\nShe shakes her head like she’s confused. “I don’t get you guys. One day you’re all over each other, the next you’re acting like you can’t stand to be in the same room. You really need to make a decision about him, Charlie.”\n\nShe stops outside a doorway.\n\n“This is me…” I say, to see if she’ll protest. She doesn’t.\n\n“Call me later,” she says. “I want to know about last night.”\n\nI nod. When she disappears into the sea of faces, I step into the classroom. I don’t know where to sit, so I wander to the back row and slide into a seat by the window. I’m early, so I open my backpack. There’s a wallet wedged between a couple of notebooks and a makeup bag. I pull it out and flip it open to reveal a driver’s license with a picture of a beaming, dark haired girl. Me.\n\nCHARLIZE MARGARET WYNWOOD.\n\n2417 HOLCOURT WAY,\n\nNEW ORLEANS, LA.\n\nI’m seventeen. My birthday is March twenty-first. I live in Louisiana. I study the picture in the top left corner and I don’t recognize the face. It’s my face, but I’ve never seen it. I’m…pretty. I only have twenty-eight dollars.\n\nThe seats are filling up. The one beside me stays empty, almost like everyone is too afraid to sit there. I’m in Spanish class. The teacher is pretty and young; her name is Mrs. Cardona. She doesn’t look at me like she hates me, like so many other people are looking at me. We start with tenses.\n\nI have no past.\n\nI have no past.\n\nFive minutes into class the door opens. Silas walks in, his eyes downcast. I think he’s here to tell me something, or to bring me something. I brace myself, ready to pretend, but Mrs. Cardona comments jokingly about his lateness. He takes the only available seat next to me and stares straight ahead. I stare at him. I don’t stop staring at him until finally, he turns his head to look at me. A line of sweat rolls down the side of his face.\n\nHis eyes are wide.\n\nWide...just like mine.\n\nThree hours.\n\nIt’s been almost three hours, and my mind is still in a haze.\n\nNo, not a haze. Not even a dense fog. It feels as if I’m wandering around in a pitch-black room, searching for the light switch.\n\n“You okay?” Charlie asks. I’ve been staring at her for several seconds, attempting to regain some semblance of familiarity from a face that should apparently be the most familiar to me.\n\nNothing.\n\nShe looks down at her desk and her thick, black hair falls between us like blinders. I want a better look at her. I need something to grab me, something familiar. I want to predict a birthmark or a freckle on her before I see it, because I need something recognizable. I’ll grasp at any piece of her that might convince me I’m not losing my mind.\n\nShe reaches her hand up, finally, and tucks her hair behind her ear. She looks up at me through two wide and completely unfamiliar eyes. The crease between her brows deepens and she begins biting at the pad of her thumb.\n\nShe’s worried about me. About us, maybe.\n\nUs.\n\nI want to ask her if she knows what might have happened to me, but I don’t want to scare her. How do I explain that I don’t know her? How do I explain this to anyone? I’ve spent the last three hours trying to act natural. At first I was convinced I must have used some kind of illegal substance that caused me to black out, but this is different from blacking out. This is different from being high or drunk, and I have no idea how I even know that. I don’t remember anything beyond three hours ago.\n\n“Hey.” Charlie reaches out like she’s going to touch me, then draws back. “Are you okay?”\n\nI grip the sleeve of my shirt and wipe the sheen of moisture off my forehead. When she glances back up at me, I see the concern still filling her eyes. I force my lips to form a smile.\n\n“I’m fine,” I mutter. “Long night.”\n\nAs soon as I say it, I cringe. I have no idea what kind of night I had, and if this girl sitting across from me really is my girlfriend, then a sentence like that probably isn’t very reassuring.\n\nI see a small twitch in her eye and she tilts her head. “Why was it a long night?”\n\nShit.\n\n“Silas.” The voice comes from the front of the room. I look up. “No talking,” the teacher says. She returns to her instruction, not too concerned with my reaction to being singled out. I glance back at Charlie, briefly, and then immediately stare down at my desk. My fingers trace over names carved into the wood. Charlie is still staring at me, but I don’t look at her. I flip my hand over, and I run two fingers over the callouses across the inside of my palm.\n\nDo I work? Mow lawns for a living?\n\nMaybe it’s from football. During lunch I decided to use my time to observe everyone around me, and I learned I have football practice this afternoon. I have no idea what time or where, but I’ve somehow made it through the last few hours without knowing when or where I’m supposed to be. I may not have any sort of recollection right now, but I’m learning that I’m very good at faking it. Too good, maybe.\n\nI flip my other hand over and find the same rough callouses on that palm.\n\nMaybe I live on a farm.\n\nNo. I don’t.\n\nI don’t know how I know, but even without being able to recall anything, I seem to have an immediate sense of what assumptions of mine are accurate and which are not. It could just be process of elimination, rather than intuition or memory. For example, I don’t feel like someone who lives on a farm would be wearing the clothes I have on. Nice clothes. Trendy? Looking down at my shoes, if someone asked me if I have rich parents, I’d tell them, “Yes, I do.” And I don’t know how, because I don’t remember my parents.\n\nI don’t know where I live, who I live with, or if I look more like my mother or my father.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

Everyone in the class turns to face me other than Charlie, because she hasn’t stopped staring at me since I sat down. Her eyes aren’t inquisitive or kind.\n\nHer eyes are accusing.\n\nThe teacher glares at me, but doesn’t seem at all surprised by the loss of everyone’s attention to me. She just stands, complacent, waiting for me to announce my reason for the sudden disruption.\n\nI swallow. “Bathroom.” My lips are sticky. My mouth is dry. My mind is wrecked. I don’t wait for permission before I begin to head in that direction. I can feel everyone’s stares as I push through the door.\n\nI go right and make it to the end of the hall without finding a restroom. I backtrack and pass by my classroom door, continuing until I round the corner and find the restroom. I push open the door, hoping for solitude, but someone is standing at the urinal with his back to me. I turn to the sink, but don’t look into the mirror. I stare down at the sink, placing my hands on either side of it, gripping tightly. I inhale.\n\nIf I would just look at myself, my reflection could trigger a memory, or maybe just give me a small sense of recognition. Something. Anything.\n\nThe guy who was standing at the urinal seconds before is now standing next to me, leaning against a sink with his arms folded. When I glance over at him, he’s glaring at me. His hair is so blond, it’s almost white. His skin is so pale, it reminds me of a jellyfish. Translucent, almost.\n\nI can remember what jellyfish look like, but I have no idea what I’ll find when I look at myself in the mirror?\n\n“You look like shit, Nash,” he says with a smirk.\n\nNash?\n\nEveryone else has been calling me Silas. Nash must be my last name. I would check my wallet, but there isn’t one in my pocket. Just a wad of cash. A wallet is one of the first things I looked for after…well, after it happened.\n\n“Not feeling too hot,” I grumble in response.\n\nFor a few seconds, the guy doesn’t respond. He just continues to stare at me the same way Charlie was staring at me in class, but with less concern and way more contentment. The guy smirks and pushes off the sink. He stands up straight, but is still about an inch shy of reaching my height. He takes a step forward, and I gather by the look in his eye that he isn’t closing in on me out of concern for my health.\n\n“We still haven’t settled Friday night,” the guy says to me. “Is that why you’re here now?” His nostrils flare when he speaks and his hands drop to his sides, clenching and unclenching twice.\n\nI have a two-second silent debate with myself, aware that if I step away from him, it’ll make me look like a coward. However, I’m also aware that if I step forward, I’ll be challenging him to something I don’t want to deal with right now. He obviously has issues with me and whatever it was that I chose to do Friday night that pissed him off.\n\nI compromise by giving him no reaction whatsoever. Look unaffected.\n\nI lazily move my attention to the sink and turn one of the knobs until a stream of water begins to pour from the faucet. “Save it for the field,” I say. I immediately want to take back those words. I hadn’t considered he might not even play football. I assumed he did based on his size, but if he doesn’t, my comment will have not made a damn bit of sense. I hold my breath and wait for him to correct me, or call me out.\n\nNeither of those things happens.\n\nHe stares for a few more seconds, and then he shoulders past me, purposefully bumping me on his way out the door. I cup my hands under the stream of water and take a sip. I wipe my mouth with the back of my hand and glance up. At myself.\n\nAt Silas Nash.\n\nWhat the hell kind of name is that, anyway?\n\nI’m staring, emotionless, into a pair of unfamiliar, dark eyes. I feel as though I’m staring at two eyes I’ve never seen before, despite the fact that I’ve more than likely looked at these eyes on a daily basis since I was old enough to reach a mirror.\n\nI’m as familiar with this person in the reflection as I am with the girl who is—according to some guy named Andrew—the girl I’ve been “banging” for two years now.\n\nI’m as familiar with this person in the reflection as I am with every single aspect of my life right now.\n\nWhich is not familiar at all.\n\n“Who are you?” I whisper to him.\n\nThe bathroom door begins to open slowly, and my eyes move from my reflection to the reflection of the door. A hand appears, gripping the door. I recognize the sleek, red polish on the tips of her fingers. The girl I’ve been “banging” for more than two years.\n\n“Silas?”\n\nI stand up straight and turn to face the door full-on as she peeks around it. When her eyes meet mine, it’s only for two seconds. She glances away, scanning the rest of the bathroom.\n\n“It’s just me,” I say. She nods and makes it the rest of the way through the door, albeit extremely hesitant. I wish I knew how to reassure her that everything is okay so she won’t grow suspicious. I also wish I remembered her, or anything about our relationship, because I want to tell her. I need to tell her. I need for someone else to know, so that I can ask questions.\n\nBut how does a guy tell his girlfriend he has no idea who she is? Who he, himself is?\n\nHe doesn’t tell her. He pretends, just like he’s been pretending with everyone else.\n\nOne hundred silent questions fill her eyes at once, and I immediately want to dodge them all. “I’m fine, Charlie.” I smile at her, because it feels like something I should do. “Just not feeling so hot. Go back to class.”\n\nShe doesn’t move.\n\nShe doesn’t smile.\n\nShe stays where she is, unaffected by my instruction. She reminds me of one of those animals on springs you’d ride on a playground. The kind you push, but they just bounce right back up. I feel like if someone were to shove her shoulders, she’d lean straight back, feet in place, and then bounce right back up again.\n\nI don’t remember what those things are called, but I do make a mental note that I somehow remember them. I’ve made a lot of mental notes in the last three hours.\n\nI’m a senior.\n\nMy name is Silas.\n\nNash might be my last name.\n\nMy girlfriend’s name is Charlie.\n\nI play football.\n\nI know what jellyfish look like.\n\nCharlie tilts her head and the corner of her mouth twitches slightly. Her lips part, and for a moment, all I hear are nervous breaths. When she finally forms words, I want to hide from them. I want to tell her to close her eyes and count to twenty until I’m too far away to hear her question.\n\n“What’s my last name, Silas?”\n\nHer voice is like smoke. Soft and wispy and then gone.\n\nI can’t tell if she’s extremely intuitive or if I’m doing a horrible job of covering up the fact that I know nothing. For a moment, I debate whether or not I should tell her. If I tell her and she believes me, she might be able to answer a lot of questions I have. But if I tell her and she doesn’t believe me…\n\n“Babe,” I say with a dismissive laugh. Do I call her babe? “What kind of question is that?”\n\nShe lifts the foot I was positive was stuck to the floor, and she takes a step forward. She takes another. She continues toward me until she’s about a foot away; close enough that I can smell her.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

I lean forward and grip it tightly with both hands. I slowly lift my eyes until they meet hers in the reflection.\n\n“Your last name?” My mouth is dry again and my words come out scratchy.\n\nShe waits.\n\nI look away from her and back at the eyes of the unfamiliar guy in the mirror. “I…I can’t remember.”\n\nShe disappears from the reflection, followed immediately by a loud smack. It reminds me of the sound the fish make at Pikes Place Market, when they toss and catch them in the wax paper.\n\nSmack!\n\nI spin around and she’s lying on the tile floor, eyes closed, arms splayed out. I immediately kneel down and lift her head, but as soon as I have her elevated several inches off the floor, her eyelids begin to flutter open.\n\n“Charlie?”\n\nShe sucks in a rush of air and sits up. She pulls herself out of my arms and shoves me away, almost as if she’s afraid of me. I keep my hands positioned near her in case she attempts to stand, but she doesn’t. She remains seated on the floor with her palms pressed into the tile.\n\n“You passed out,” I tell her.\n\nShe frowns at me. “I’m aware of that.”\n\nI don’t speak again. I should probably know what all her expressions mean, but I don’t. I don’t know if she’s scared or angry or…\n\n“I’m confused,” she says, shaking her head. “I…can you…” she pauses, and then makes an attempt to stand. I stand with her, but I can tell she doesn’t like this by the way she glares at my hands that are slightly lifted, waiting to catch her should she start to fall again.\n\nShe takes two steps away from me and crosses an arm over her chest. She brings her opposite hand up and begins chewing on the pad of her thumb again. She studies me quietly for a moment and then pulls her thumb from her mouth, making a fist. “You didn’t know we had class together after lunch.” Her words are spoken with a layer of accusation. “You don’t know my last name.”\n\nI shake my head, admitting to the two things I can’t deny.\n\n“What can you remember?” she asks.\n\nShe’s scared. Nervous. Suspicious. Our emotions are reflections of one another, and that’s when the clarity hits.\n\nShe may not feel familiar. I may not feel familiar. But our actions—our demeanor—they’re exactly the same.\n\n“What do I remember?” I repeat her question in an attempt to buy myself a few more seconds to allow my suspicions to gain footing.\n\nShe waits for my answer.\n\n“History,” I say, attempting to remember as far back as I can. “Books. I saw a girl drop her books.” I grab my neck again and squeeze.\n\n“Oh, God.” She takes a quick step toward me. “That’s…that’s the first thing I remember.”\n\nMy heart jumps to my throat.\n\nShe begins to shake her head. “I don’t like this. It doesn’t make sense.” She appears calm—calmer than I feel. Her voice is steady. The only fear I see is in the stretched whites of her eyes. I pull her to me without thinking, but I think it’s more for my own relief rather than to put her at ease. She doesn’t pull away, and for a second, I wonder if this is normal for us. I wonder if we’re in love.\n\nI tighten my hold until I feel her stiffen against me. “We need to figure this out,” she says, separating herself from me.\n\nMy first instinct is to tell her it’ll be okay, that I’ll figure it out. I’m flooded with an overwhelming need to protect her—only I have no idea how to do that when we’re both experiencing the same reality.\n\nThe bell rings, signaling the end of Spanish. Within seconds, the bathroom door will probably open. Lockers will be slamming shut. We’ll have to figure out what classes we’re supposed to be in next. I take her hand and pull her behind me as I push open the bathroom door.\n\n“Where are we going?” she asks.\n\nI look at her over my shoulder and shrug. “I have no idea. I just know I want to leave.”\n\nThis dude—this guy, Silas—he grabs my hand like he knows me and drags me behind him like I’m a little kid. And that’s what I feel like—a little kid in a big, big world. I don’t understand anything, and I most certainly don’t recognize anything. All I can think, as he pulls me through the understated halls of some anonymous high school, is that I fainted; keeled over like some damsel in distress. And on the boys’ bathroom floor. Filthy. I’m evaluating my priorities, wondering how my brain can fit germs into the equation when I clearly have a much larger problem, when we burst into the sunlight. I shield my eyes with my free hand as the Silas dude pulls keys from his backpack. He holds them above his head and makes a circle, clicking the alarm button on his key fob. From some far corner of the parking lot we hear the shriek of an alarm.\n\nWe run for it, our shoes slapping the concrete with urgency, as if someone is chasing us. And they might be. The car turns out to be an SUV. I know it’s impressive because it sits above the other cars, making them look small and insignificant. A Land Rover. Silas is either driving his dad’s car, or floating in his dad’s money. Maybe he doesn’t have a dad. He wouldn’t be able to tell me anyway. And how do I even know how much a car like this costs? I have memories of how things work: a car, the rules of the road, the presidents, but not of who I am.\n\nHe opens the door for me while looking over his shoulder toward the school, and I get the feeling I’m being pranked. He could be responsible for this. He could have given me something to cause me to lose my memory temporarily, and now he’s only pretending.\n\n“Is this for real?” I ask, suspended above the front seat. “You don’t know who you are?”\n\n“No,” he says. “I don’t.”\n\nI believe him. Kind of. I sink into my seat.\n\nHe searches my eyes for a moment longer before slamming my door and running around to the driver’s side. I feel rough. Like after a night of drinking. Do I drink? My license said I was only seventeen. I chew on my thumb as he climbs in and starts the engine by pressing a button.\n\n“How’d you know how to do that?” I ask.\n\n“Do what?”\n\n“Start the car without a key.”\n\n“I…I don’t know.”\n\nI watch his face as we pull out of the spot. He blinks a lot, glances at me more, runs a tongue over his bottom lip. When we’re at a stoplight, he finds the HOME button on the GPS and hits it. I’m impressed that he thought to do that.\n\n“Redirecting,” a woman’s voice says. I want to lose it, jump out of the moving car and run like a frightened deer. I am so afraid.\n\nHis home is large. There are no cars in the driveway as we linger on the curb, the engine purring quietly.\n\n“Are you sure this is you?” I ask.\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n“Doesn’t look like anyone is home,” he says. “Should we?”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

I shouldn’t be hungry, but I am. I want to go inside and have something to eat, maybe research our symptoms and see if we’ve come in contact with some brain-eating bacteria that’s stolen our memories. A house like this should have a couple of laptops lying around. Silas turns into the driveway and parks. We climb out timidly, looking around at the shrubs and trees like they’re going to come alive. He finds a key on his key ring that opens the front door. As I stand behind him and wait, I study him. In his clothes and hair he wears the cool look of a guy who doesn’t care, but he carries his shoulders like he cares too much. He also smells like the outside: grass, and pine, and rich black dirt. He’s about to turn the knob.\n\n“Wait!”\n\nHe turns around slowly, despite the urgency in my voice.\n\n“What if there’s someone in there?”\n\nHe grins, or maybe it’s a grimace. “Maybe they can tell us what the hell is happening…”\n\nThen we are inside. We stand immobile for a minute, looking around. I cower behind Silas like a wimp. It’s not cold but I’m shivering. Everything is heavy and impressive—the furniture, the air, my book bag, which hangs off my shoulder like dead weight. Silas moves forward. I grab onto the back of his shirt as we skirt through the foyer and into the family room. We move from room to room, stopping to examine the photos on the walls. Two smiling, sun-kissed parents with their arms around two smiling, dark-haired boys, the ocean in the background.\n\n“You have a little brother,” I say. “Did you know you have a little brother?”\n\nHe shakes his head, no. The smiling in the photos becomes more scarce as Silas and his mini-me brother get older. There is plenty of acne and braces, photos of parents who are trying too hard to be cheerful as they pull stiff-shouldered boys toward them. We move to the bedrooms…the bathrooms. We pick up books, read the labels on brown prescription bottles we find in medicine cabinets. His mother keeps dried flowers all over the house; pressed into the books on her nightstand, in her makeup drawer, and lined up on the shelves in their bedroom. I touch each one, whispering their names under my breath. I remember all the names of the flowers. For some reason, this makes me giggle. Silas stops short when he walks into his parents’ bathroom and finds me bent over laughing.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I say. “ I had a moment.”\n\n“What kind of moment?”\n\n“A moment where I realized that I’ve forgotten everything in the world about myself, but I know what a hyacinth is.”\n\nHe nods. “Yeah.” He looks down at his hands, creases forming on his forehead.\n\n“Do you think we should tell someone? Go to a hospital, maybe?”\n\n“Do you think they’d believe us?” I ask. We stare at each other then. And I hold back the urge once again to ask if I’m being pranked. This isn’t a prank. It’s too real.\n\nWe move to his father’s study next, scouring over papers and looking in drawers. There is nothing to tell us why we are like this, nothing out of the ordinary. I keep a close watch on him from the corner of my eye. If this is a prank, he’s a very good actor. Maybe this is an experiment, I think. I’m part of some psychological, government experiment and I’m going to wake up in a lab. Silas watches me too. I see his eyes darting over me, wondering…assessing. We don’t speak much. Just, Look at this. Or, Do you think this is something?\n\nWe are strangers and there are few words between us.\n\nSilas’s room is last. He clutches my hand as we enter and I let him because I’m starting to feel light-headed again. The first thing I see is a photo of us on his desk. I am wearing a costume—a too-short leopard print tutu and black angel wings that spread elegantly behind me. My eyes are lined with thick, glittery lashes. Silas is dressed in all white, with white angel wings. He looks handsome. Good vs. evil, I think. Is that the sort of life game we played? He glances at me and raises his eyebrows.\n\n“Poor costume choice,” I shrug. He cracks a smile and then we move to opposite sides of the room.\n\nI lift my eyes to walls where there are framed photos of people: a homeless man slouched against a wall, holding a blanket around himself; a woman sitting on a bench, crying into her hands. A gypsy, her hand clamped around her own neck as she looks into the camera lens with empty eyes. The photos are morbid. They make me want to turn away, feel ashamed. I don’t understand why anyone would want to take a photo of such morbidly sad things, never mind hang them on their walls to look at everyday.\n\nAnd then I turn and see the expensive camera perched on the desk. It’s in a place of honor, sitting atop a pile of glossy photography books. I look over to where Silas is also studying the photos. An artist. Is this his work? Is he trying to recognize it? No point in asking. I move on, look at his clothes, look in the drawers in the rich mahogany desk.\n\nI’m so tired. I make to sit down in the desk chair, but he’s suddenly animated, beckoning me over.\n\n“Look at this,” he says. I get up slowly and walk to his side. He’s staring down at his unmade bed. His eyes are bright and should I say…shocked? I follow them to his sheets. And then my blood runs cold.\n\n“Oh, my God.”\n\nI toss the comforter out of the way to get a better look at the mess at the foot of the bed. Smears of mud caked into the sheet. Dried. Pieces of it crack and roll away when I pull the sheet taut.\n\n“Is that…” Charlie stops speaking and pulls the corner of the top sheet from my hand, tossing it away to get a better look at the fitted sheet beneath it. “Is that blood?”\n\nI follow her eyes up the sheet, toward the head of the bed. Next to the pillow is a smeared ghost of a handprint. I immediately look down at my hands.\n\nNothing. No traces of blood or mud whatsoever.\n\nI kneel down beside the bed and place my right hand over the handprint left on the mattress. It’s a perfect match. Or imperfect, depending on how you look at it. I glance at Charlie and her eyes drift away, almost as if she doesn’t want to know whether or not the handprint belongs to me. The fact that it’s mine only adds to the questions. We have so many questions piled up at this point, it feels as though the pile is about to collapse and bury us in everything but answers.\n\n“It’s probably my own blood,” I say to her. Or maybe I say it to myself. I try to dismiss whatever thoughts I know are developing in her head. “I could have fallen outside last night.”\n\nI feel like I’m making excuses for someone who isn’t me. I feel like I’m making excuses for a friend of mine. This Silas guy. Someone who definitely isn’t me.\n\n“Where were you last night?”\n\nIt’s not a real question, just something we’re both thinking. I pull at the top sheet and comforter and spread them out over the bed to hide the mess. The evidence. The clues. Whatever it is, I just want to cover it up.\n\n“What does this mean?” she asks, turning to face me. She’s holding a sheet of paper. I walk to her and take it out of her hands. It looks like it’s been folded and unfolded so many times, there’s a small, worn hole forming in the very center of it. The sentence across the page reads, Never stop. Never forget.\n\nI drop the sheet of paper on the desk, wanting it out of my hands. The paper feels like evidence, too. I don’t want to touch it. “I don’t know what it means.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

It’s the only thing I remember the taste of. Maybe because water has no taste.\n\n“Did you write it?” she demands.\n\n“How would I know?” I don’t like the tone in my voice. I sound aggravated. I don’t want her to think I’m aggravated with her.\n\nShe turns and walks swiftly to her backpack. She digs around inside and pulls out a pen, then walks back to me, shoving it in my hand. “Copy it.”\n\nShe’s bossy. I look down at the pen, rolling it between my fingers. I run my thumb across the embossed words printed down the side of it.\n\nWYNWOOD-NASH FINANCIAL GROUP.\n\n“See if your handwriting matches,” she says. She flips the page over to the blank side and pushes it toward me. I catch her eyes, fall into them a little. But then I’m angry.\n\nI hate that she thinks of this stuff first. I hold the pen in my right hand. It doesn’t feel comfortable. I switch the pen to my left hand and it fits better. I’m a leftie.\n\nI write the words from memory, and after she gets a good look at my handwriting, I flip the page back over.\n\nThe handwriting is different. Mine is sharp, concise. The other is loose and uncaring. She takes the pen and rewrites the words.\n\nIt’s a perfect match. We both stare quietly at the paper, unsure if it even means anything. It could mean nothing. It could mean everything. The dirt on my sheets could mean everything. The blood-smeared handprint could mean everything. The fact that we can remember basic things but not people could mean everything. The clothes I’m wearing, the color of her nail polish, the camera on my desk, the photos on the wall, the clock above the door, the half-empty glass of water on the desk. I’m turning, taking it all in. It could all mean everything.\n\nOr it could all mean absolutely nothing.\n\nI don’t know what to catalog in my mind and what to ignore. Maybe if I just fall asleep, I’ll wake up tomorrow and be completely normal again.\n\n“I’m hungry,” she says.\n\nShe’s watching me; strands of hair stand between me and a full view of her face. She’s beautiful, but in a shameful way. One I’m not sure I’m supposed to appreciate. Everything about her is captivating, like the aftermath of a storm. People aren’t supposed to get pleasure out of the destruction Mother Nature is capable of, but we want to stare anyway. Charlie is the devastation left in the wake of a tornado.\n\nHow do I know that?\n\nRight now she looks calculating, staring at me like this. I want to grab my camera and take a picture of her. Something twirls in my stomach like ribbons, and I’m not sure if it’s nerves or hunger or my reaction to the girl standing next to me.\n\n“Let’s go downstairs,” I tell her. I reach for her backpack and hand it to her. I grab the camera from the dresser. “We’ll eat while we search our things.”\n\nShe walks in front of me, pausing at every picture between my room and the bottom of the stairwell. With each picture we pass, she trails her finger over my face, and my face alone. I watch as she quietly tries to figure me out through the series of photographs. I want to tell her she’s wasting her time. Whoever is in those pictures, it isn’t me.\n\nAs soon as we reach the bottom of the stairs, our ears are assaulted by a short burst of a scream. Charlie comes to a sudden halt and I bump into the back of her. The scream belongs to a woman standing in the doorway of the kitchen.\n\nHer eyes are wide, darting from me to Charlie, back and forth.\n\nShe’s clutching her heart, exhaling with relief.\n\nShe’s not from any of the photographs. She’s plump and older, maybe in her sixties. She’s wearing an apron that reads, “I put the ‘hor’ in Hors d’oeuvres.”\n\nHer hair is pulled back, but she brushes away loose, grey strands as she blows out a calming breath. “Jesus, Silas! You scared me half to death!” She spins and heads into the kitchen. “You two better get back to school before your father finds out. I’m not lying for you.”\n\nCharlie is still frozen in front of me, so I place a hand against her lower back and nudge her forward. She glances at me over her shoulder. “Do you know…”\n\nI shake my head, cutting off her question. She’s about to ask me if I know the woman in the kitchen. The answer is no. I don’t know her, I don’t know Charlie, I don’t know the family in the photos.\n\nWhat I do know is the camera in my hands. I look down at it, wondering how I can remember everything there is to know about operating this camera, but I can’t remember how I learned any of those things. I know how to adjust the ISO. I know how to adjust shutter speed to give a waterfall the appearance of a soft stream, or make each individual drop of water stand on its own. This camera has the ability to put the smallest detail in focus, like the curve of Charlie’s hand, or the eyelashes lining her eyes, while everything else about her becomes a blur. I know that I somehow know the ins and outs of this camera better than I know what my own little brother’s voice should sound like.\n\nI wrap the strap around my neck and allow the camera to dangle against my chest as I follow Charlie toward the kitchen. She’s walking with purpose. So far, I’ve concluded that everything she does has a purpose. She wastes nothing. Every step she takes appears to be planned out before she takes it. Every word she says is necessary. Whenever her eyes land on something, she focuses on it with all of her senses, as though her eyes alone could determine how something tastes, smells, sounds and feels. And she only looks at things when there’s a reason for it. Forget the floors, the curtains, the photographs in the hall that don’t have my face in them. She doesn’t waste time on things that aren’t of use to her.\n\nWhich is why I follow her when she walks into the kitchen. I’m not sure what her purpose is right now. It’s either to find out more information from the housekeeper or she’s on the hunt for food.\n\nCharlie claims a seat at the massive bar and pulls out the chair next to her and pats it without looking up at me. I take the seat and set my camera down in front of me. She drops her backpack onto the counter and begins to unzip it. “Ezra, I’m starving. Is there anything to eat?”\n\nMy entire body swivels toward Charlie’s on the stool, but it feels like my stomach is somewhere on the floor beneath me. How does she know her name?\n\nCharlie glances at me with a quick shake of her head. “Calm down,” she hisses. “It’s written right there.” She points at a note—a shopping list—lying in front of us. It’s a pink stationary pad, personalized, with kittens lining the bottom of the page. At the top of the personalized stationary it reads, “Things Ezra needs right meow.”\n\nThe woman closes a cabinet and faces Charlie. “Did you work up an appetite while you were upstairs? Because in case you weren’t aware, they serve lunch at the school you should both be attending right now.”\n\n“You mean right meow,” I say without thinking. Charlie spatters laughter, and then I’m laughing too. And it feels like someone finally let air into the room. Ezra, less amused, rolls her eyes. It makes me wonder if I used to be funny. I also smile, because the fact that she didn’t appear confused by Charlie referring to her as Ezra means Charlie was right.\n\nI reach over and run my hand along the back of Charlie’s neck. She flinches when I touch her, but relaxes almost immediately when she realizes it’s part of our act. We’re in love, Charlie. Remember?\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

I brought her here so she could nap, but she hasn’t eaten today.” I return my attention to Ezra and smile. “Do you have anything to make my girl feel better? Some soup or crackers, maybe?”\n\nEzra’s expression softens when she sees the affection I’m showing Charlie. She grabs a hand towel and tosses it over her shoulder. “I’ll tell you what, Char. How about I make you my grilled cheese specialty? It was your favorite back when you used to visit.”\n\nMy hand stiffens against Charlie’s neck. Back when you used to visit? We both look at each other, more questions clouding our eyes. Charlie nods. “Thank you, Ezra,” she says.\n\nEzra shuts the refrigerator door with her hip and begins dropping items onto the counter. Butter. Mayonnaise. Bread. Cheese. More cheese. Parmesan cheese. She lays a pan on the stove and ignites the flame. “I’ll make you one, too, Silas,” Ezra says. “You must have caught whatever bug Charlie has, because you haven’t spoken to me this much since you hit puberty.” She chuckles after her comment.\n\n“Why don’t I speak to you?”\n\nCharlie nudges my leg and narrows her eyes. I shouldn’t have asked that.\n\nEzra slides the knife into the butter and retrieves a slab of it. She smears it across the bread. “Oh, you know,” she says, shrugging her shoulders. “Little boys grow up. They become men. Housekeepers stop being Aunt Ezra and return to just being housekeepers.” Her voice is sad now.\n\nI grimace, because I don’t like learning about this side of myself. I don’t want Charlie learning about this side of me.\n\nMy eyes fall to the camera in front of me. I power it on. Charlie begins rifling through her backpack, inspecting item after item.\n\n“Uh oh,” she says.\n\nShe’s holding a phone. I lean over her shoulder and look at the screen with her, just as she switches the ringer to the on position. There are seven missed calls and even more texts, all from “Mom.”\n\nShe opens the latest text message, sent just three minutes ago.\n\nYou have three minutes to call me back.\n\nI guess I didn’t think about the ramifications of us ditching school. The ramifications of parents we don’t even remember. “We should go,” I say to her.\n\nWe both stand at the same time. She throws her backpack over her shoulder and I grab my camera.\n\n“Wait,” Ezra says. “The first sandwich is almost done.” She walks to the refrigerator and grabs two cans of Sprite. “This will help with her stomach.” She hands me both sodas and then wraps the grilled cheese in a paper towel. Charlie is already waiting at the front door. Just as I’m about to walk away from Ezra, she squeezes my wrist. I face her again, and her eyes move from Charlie to me. “It’s good to see her back here,” Ezra says softly. “I’ve been worried how everything between both your fathers might have affected the two of you. You’ve loved that girl since before you could walk.”\n\nI stare at her, not sure how to process all the information I just received. “Before I could walk, huh?”\n\nShe smiles like she has one of my secrets. I want it back.\n\n“Silas,” Charlie says.\n\nI shoot a quick smile at Ezra and head for Charlie. As soon as I reach the front door, the shrill ring on her phone startles her and it falls from her hands, straight to the floor. She kneels to pick it up. “It’s her,” she says, standing. “What should I do?”\n\nI open the door and urge her outside by her elbow. Once the door is shut, I face her again. The phone is on its third ring. “You should answer it.”\n\nShe stares at the phone, her fingers gripping tightly around it. She doesn’t answer it, so I reach down and swipe right to answer. She crinkles up her nose and glares at me as she brings it to her ear. “Hello?”\n\nWe begin walking to the car, but I listen quietly at the broken phrases coming through her phone: “You know better,” and “Skip school,” and “How could you?” The words continue to come out of her phone, until we’re both seated in my car with the doors shut. I start the car and the woman’s voice grows quiet for several seconds. Suddenly, the voice is blaring through the speakers of my car. Bluetooth. I remember what Bluetooth is.\n\nI place the drinks and sandwich on the center console and begin to back out of the driveway. Charlie still hasn’t had a chance to respond to her mother, but she rolls her eyes when I look at her.\n\n“Mom,” Charlie says flatly, attempting to interrupt her. “Mom, I’m on my way home. Silas is taking me to my car.”\n\nThere’s a long silence that follows Charlie’s words, and somehow her mother is much more intimidating when words aren’t being yelled through the phone. When she does begin speaking again, her words come out slow and overenunciated. “Please tell me you did not allow that family to buy you a car.”\n\nOur eyes meet and Charlie mouths the word shit. “I…no. No, I meant Silas is bringing me home. Be there in a few minutes.” Charlie fumbles with the phone in her hands, attempting to return to a screen that will allow her to end the call. I press the disconnect button on the steering wheel and end it for her.\n\nShe inhales slowly, turning to face her window. When she exhales, a small circle of fog appears against the window near her mouth. “Silas?” She faces me and arches a brow. “I think my mother may be a bitch.”\n\nI laugh, but offer no reassurance. I agree with her.\n\nWe’re both quiet for several miles. I repeat my brief conversation with Ezra over and over in my head. I’m unable to push the scene out of my head, and she’s not even my parent. I can’t imagine what Charlie must be feeling right now after speaking to her actual mother. I think both of us have had the reassurance in the backs of our minds that once we came in contact with someone as close to us as our own parents, it would trigger our memory. I can tell by Charlie’s reaction that she didn’t recognize a single thing about the woman she spoke to on the phone.\n\n“I don’t have a car,” she says quietly. I look over at her and she’s drawing a cross with her fingertip on the fogged up window. “I’m seventeen. I wonder why I don’t have a car.”\n\nAs soon as she mentions the car, I remember that I’m still driving in the direction of the school, rather than wherever I need to be taking her. “Do you happen to know where you live, Charlie?”\n\nHer eyes swing to mine, and in a split second the confusion on her face is overcome by clarity. It’s fascinating how easily I can read her expressions now in comparison to earlier this morning. Her eyes are like two open books and I suddenly want to devour every page.\n\nShe pulls her wallet from her backpack and reads the address from her driver’s license. “If you pull over we can put it in the GPS,” she says.\n\nI push the navigation button. “These cars are made in London. You don’t have to idle to program an address into the GPS.” I begin to enter her street number and I feel her watching me. I don’t even have to see her eyes to know they’re overflowing with suspicion.\n\nI shake my head before she even asks the question. “No, I don’t know how I knew that.”\n\nOnce the address is entered, I turn the car around and begin to head in the direction of her house. We’re seven miles away. She opens both sodas and tears the sandwich in half, handing me part of it. We drive six miles without speaking. I want to reach over and grab her hand to comfort her. I want to say something reassuring to her. If this were yesterday, I’m sure I would have done that without a second thought. But it’s not yesterday. It’s today, and Charlie and I are complete strangers today.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\n7 phút mỗi ngày!

Make sure you tell Ezra I said so.”\n\nI slow down. I drive well below the speed limit until we reach her street, and then I stop as soon as I turn onto the road. She’s staring out her window, taking in each and every house. They’re small. One-story houses, each with a one-car garage. Any one of these houses could fit inside my kitchen and we’d still have room to cook a meal.\n\n“Do you want me to go inside with you?”\n\nShe shakes her head. “You probably shouldn’t. It doesn’t sound like my mother likes you very much.”\n\nShe’s right. I wish I knew what her mother was referring to when she said that family. I wish I knew what Ezra was referring to when she mentioned our fathers.\n\n“I think it’s that one,” she says, pointing to one a few houses down. I let off the gas and roll toward it. It’s by far the nicest one on the street, but only because the yard was recently mowed and the paint on the window frames isn’t peeling off in chunks.\n\nMy car slows and eventually comes to a stop in front of the house. We both stare at it, quietly taking in the vast separation between the lives we live. However, it’s nothing like the separation I feel knowing we’re about to have to split up for the rest of the night. She’s been a good buffer between myself and reality.\n\n“Do me a favor,” I tell her as I put the car in park. “Look for my name in your caller ID. I want to see if I have a phone in here.”\n\nShe nods and begins scrolling through her contacts. She swipes her finger across the screen and brings her phone to her ear, pulling her bottom lip in with her teeth to hide what looks like a smile.\n\nRight when I open my mouth to ask her what just made her smile, a muffled ring comes from the console. I flip it open and reach in until I find the phone. When I look at the screen, I read the contact.\n\nCharlie baby\n\nI guess that answers my question. She must also have a nickname for me. I swipe answer and bring the phone to my ear. “Hey, Charlie baby.”\n\nShe laughs, and it comes at me twice. Once through my phone and again from the seat next to me.\n\n“I’m afraid we might have been a pretty cheesy couple, Silas baby,” she says.\n\n“Seems like it.” I run the pad of my thumb around the steering wheel, waiting for her to speak again. She doesn’t. She’s still staring at the unfamiliar house.\n\n“Call me as soon as you get a chance, okay?”\n\n“I will,” she says.\n\n“You might have kept a journal. Look for anything that could help us.”\n\n“I will,” she says again.\n\nWe’re both still holding our phones to our ears. I’m not sure if she’s hesitating to get out because she’s scared of what she’ll find inside or because she doesn’t want to leave the only other person who understands her situation.\n\n“Do you think you’ll tell anyone?” I ask.\n\nShe pulls the phone from her ear, swiping the end button. “I don’t want anyone to think I’m going crazy.”\n\n“You’re not going crazy,” I say. “Not if it’s happening to both of us.”\n\nHer lips press into a tight, thin line. She gives her head the softest nod, as if it’s made from glass. “Exactly. If I were going through this alone, it would be easy to just say I’m going crazy. But I’m not alone. We’re both experiencing this, which means it’s something else entirely. And that scares me, Silas.”\n\nShe opens the door and steps out. I roll the window down as she closes the door behind her. She folds her arms over the windowsill and forces a smile as she gestures over her shoulder toward the house behind her. “I guess it’s safe to say I won’t have a housekeeper to cook me grilled cheese.”\n\nI force a smile in return. “You know my number. Just call if you need me to come rescue you.”\n\nHer fake smile is swallowed up by a genuine frown. “Like a damsel in distress.” She rolls her eyes. She reaches through the window and grabs her backpack. “Wish me luck, Silas baby.” Her endearment is full of sarcasm, and I kind of hate it.\n\n“Mom?” My voice is weak, a squeak. I clear my throat. “Mom?” I call again.\n\nShe comes careening around the corner and I immediately think of a car without brakes. I retreat two steps until my back is flush against the front door.\n\n“What were you doing with that boy?” she hisses.\n\nI can smell the liquor on her breath.\n\n“I…he brought me home from school.” I wrinkle my nose and breathe through my mouth. She’s all up in my personal space. I reach behind me and grab the doorknob in case I need to make a quick exit. I was hoping to feel something when I saw her. She was my incubating uterus and birthday party thrower for the last seventeen years. I half expected a rush of warmth or memories, some familiarity. I flinch away from the stranger in front of me.\n\n“You skipped school. You were with that boy! Care to explain?”\n\nShe smells like a bar just vomited on her. “I don’t feel like…myself. I asked him to bring me home.” I back up a step. “Why are you drunk in the middle of the day?’\n\nHer eyes splay wide and for a minute I think it’s a real possibility that she might hit me. At the last moment she stumbles back and slides down the wall until she’s sitting on the floor. Tears invade her eyes and I have to look away.\n\nOkay, I wasn’t expecting that.\n\nYelling I can deal with. Crying makes me nervous. Especially when it’s a complete stranger and I don’t know what to say. I creep past her just as she buries her face in her hands and begins to sob hard. I’m not sure if this is normal for her. I hesitate, hovering right where the foyer ends and the living room starts. In the end, I leave her to her tears and decide to find my bedroom. I can’t help her. I don’t even know her.\n\nI want to hide until I figure something out. Like who the hell I am. The house is smaller than I thought. Just past where my mother is crying on the floor, there is a kitchen and a small living room. They sit squat and orderly, filled to the max with furniture that doesn’t look like it belongs. Expensive things in a non-expensive house. There are three doors. The first is open. I peer in and see a plaid bedspread. My parents’ bedroom? I know from the plaid bedspread that it isn’t mine. I like flowers. I open the second of the doors: a bathroom. The third is another bedroom on the left side of the hallway. I step inside. Two beds. I groan. I have a sibling.\n\nI lock the door behind me, and my eyes dart around the shared space. I have a sister. By the looks of her things she is younger than me by at least a few years. I stare at the band posters that adorn her side of the room with distaste. My side is simpler: a twin bed with a dark purple comforter and a framed black and white print that hangs on the wall over the bed. I immediately know it’s something Silas photographed. A broken gate that hangs on its hinges; vines choking their way through the rusted metal prongs—not as dark as the prints in his bedroom, perhaps more suited toward me. There is a stack of books on my nightstand. I reach for one to read the title when my phone pings.\n\nSilas: You okay?\n\nMe: I think my mom is an alcoholic and I have a sister.\n\nHis response comes a few seconds later.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nMen gan cao chính là vì đã mắc virus viêm gan B!

This is so awkward.\n\nI laugh and set my phone down. I want to dig around, see if I can find anything suspicious. My drawers are neat. I must have OCD. I toss around the socks and underwear to see if I can piss myself off.\n\nThere is nothing in my drawers, nothing in my nightstand. I find a box of condoms stuffed in a purse under my bed. I look for a journal, notes written by friends—there is nothing. I am a sterile human, boring if not for that print above my bed. A print which Silas gave to me, not one I picked out myself.\n\nMy mother is in the kitchen. I can hear her sniffling and making herself something to eat. She’s drunk, I think. Maybe I should ask her some questions and she won’t remember I asked them.\n\n“Hey, er…mom,” I say, coming to stand near her. She pauses in her toast-making to look at me with bleary eyes.\n\n“So, was I being weird last night?”\n\n“Last night?” she repeats.\n\n“Yeah,” I say. “You know…when I came home.”\n\nShe scrapes the knife over the bread until it is smeared with butter.\n\n“You were dirty,” she slurs. “I told you to take a shower.”\n\nI think of the dirt and leaves in Silas’s bed. That means we were probably together.\n\n“What time did I get home? My phone was dead,” I lie.\n\nShe narrows her eyes. “Around ten o’clock.”\n\n“Did I say anything…unusual?”\n\nShe turns away and wanders over to the sink where she bites into her toast and stares down the drain.\n\n“Mom! Pay attention. I need you to answer me.”\n\nWhy does this feel familiar? Me begging, her ignoring.\n\n“No,” she says simply. Then I have a thought: my clothes from last night. Off the kitchen there is a small closet with a stacked washer and dryer inside of it. I open the lid to the washing machine and see a small mound of wet clothes clumped at the bottom. I pull them out. They are definitely my size. I must have thrown them in here last night, tried to wash away the evidence. Evidence of what? I pry the pockets of the jeans open with my fingers and reach inside. There is a wad of paper, clumped in a thick, damp mess. I drop the jeans and carry the wad back to my room. If I try to unfold it, it might fall apart. I decide to set it on the windowsill and wait for it to dry.\n\nI text Silas.\n\nMe: Where are you?\n\nI wait a few minutes and when he doesn’t text back, I try again.\n\nMe: Silas!\n\nI wonder if I always do this; harass him until he answers.\n\nI send five more and then I toss my phone across the room, burying my face in Charlie Wynwood’s pillow to cry. Charlie Wynwood probably never cried. She has no personality from the looks of her bedroom. Her mother is an alcoholic and her sister listens to crappy music. And how do I know that the poster above my sister’s bed compares love to a boom and a clap, but I don’t remember said sister’s name? I wander over to her side of the small bedroom and rummage around in her things.\n\n“Ding, ding, ding!” I say, pulling a pink polka dot journal out from under her pillow.\n\nI settle down on her bed and flip open the cover.\n\nProperty of Janette Elise Wynwood.\n\nDO NOT READ!\n\nI ignore the warning and page to her first entry, titled:\n\nCharlie sucks.\n\nMy sister is the worst person on the planet. I hope she dies.\n\nI close the book and put it back underneath the pillow.\n\n“That went well.”\n\nMy family hates me. What type of human are you when your own family hates you? From across the room my phone tells me that I have a text. I jump up, thinking it’s Silas, suddenly feeling relieved. There are two texts. One is from Amy.\n\nWhere r u?!!\n\nAnd the other is from a guy named Brian.\n\nHey, missed u today. Did you tell him?\n\nHim who? And tell him what?\n\nI set my phone down without answering either of them. I decide to give the journal another try, skipping all the way to Janette’s last entry, which was last night.\n\nTitle: I might need braces but we’re too broke. Charlie had braces.\n\nI run my tongue over my teeth. Yup, they feel pretty straight.\n\nHer teeth are all straight and perfect and I’m going to have a snaggle tooth forever. Mom said she’d see about financing but ever since that thing happened with dad’s company we don’t have money for normal things. I hate taking packed lunch to school. I feel like a kindergartener!\n\nI skip a paragraph in which she details her friend, Payton’s, last period. She’s ranting about her lack of menstruation when her journaling is disturbed by yours truly.\n\nI have to go. Charlie just got home and she’s crying. She hardly ever cries. I hope Silas broke up with her—would serve her right.\n\nSo I was crying when I came home last night? I walk over to the windowsill where the paper from my pocket has somewhat dried. Carefully smoothing it out, I lay it on the desk my sister and I seem to share. Part of the ink has washed away, but it looks like a receipt. I text Silas.\n\nMe: Silas, I need a ride.\n\nI wait again, growing irritated with his delay in response. I am impatient, I think.\n\nMe: There’s a guy named Brian who’s texting me. He’s really flirty. I can ask him for a ride if you’re busy…\n\nMy phone pings a second later.\n\nSilas: Hell no. OMW!\n\nI smile.\n\nIt shouldn’t be a problem slipping out of the house since my mother has passed out on the sofa. I watch her for a moment, studying her sleeping face, trying desperately to remember it. She looks like Charlie, only older. Before I head outside to wait for Silas, I cover her with a blanket and grab a couple of sodas from the barren fridge.\n\n“See ya, Mom,” I say quietly.\n\nI can’t tell if I’m going back to her because I feel protective over her or possessive of her. Either way, I don’t like the idea of her reaching out to someone else. It makes me wonder who this Brian guy is, and why he thinks it’s okay to send her flirty texts when Charlie and I are obviously together.\n\nMy left hand is still clutching my phone when it rings again. There’s no number on the screen. Just the word “Bro.” I slide my finger across it and answer the phone.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Where the hell are you?”\n\nIt’s a guy’s voice. A voice that sounds a lot like mine. I look left and right, but nothing is familiar about the intersection I’m passing through. “I’m in my car.”\n\nHe groans. “No shit. You keep missing practice, you’ll be benched.”\n\nYesterday’s Silas probably would have been pissed off about this. Today’s Silas is relieved. “What day is today?”\n\n“Wednesday. Day before tomorrow, day after yesterday. Come get me, practice is over.”\n\nWhy does he not have his own car? I don’t even know this kid and he already feels like an inconvenience. He’s definitely my brother.\n\n“I have to pick up Charlie first,” I tell him.\n\nThere’s a pause. “At her house?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nAnother pause. “Do you have a death wish?”\n\nI really hate not knowing what everyone else seems to know. Why would I not be allowed at Charlie’s house?\n\n“Whatever, just hurry up,” he says, right before hanging up.\n\nShe’s standing in the street when I turn the corner. She’s staring at her house. Her hands are resting gently at her sides, and she’s holding two sodas. One in each hand. She’s holding them like weapons, like she wants to throw them at the house in front of her in hopes that they’re actually grenades. I slow the car down and stop several feet from her.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

She’s wearing a long, black skirt that covers her feet. A black scarf is wrapped around her neck, falling over her shoulder. Her shirt is tan and long-sleeved, but she still looks cold. A gust of wind blows and the skirt and scarf move with it, but she remains unaffected. She doesn’t even blink. She’s lost in thought.\n\nI’m lost in her.\n\nWhen I put the car in park, she turns her head, looks at me and then immediately casts her eyes at the ground. She walks toward the passenger door and climbs inside. Her silence seems to be begging for my silence, so I don’t say anything as we head toward the school. After a couple of miles, she relaxes against the seat and props one of her booted feet against the dash. “Where are we going?”\n\n“My brother called. He needs a ride.”\n\nShe nods.\n\n“Apparently I’m in trouble for not showing up to football practice today.” I’m sure she can tell by the lackadaisical tone of my voice that I’m not too concerned about missing practice. Football isn’t really on my list of priorities right now, so being benched is probably the best outcome for everyone.\n\n“You play football,” she says, matter of fact. “I don’t do anything. I’m boring, Silas. My room is boring. I don’t keep a journal. I don’t collect anything. The only thing I have is a picture of a gate, and I didn’t even take the picture. You did. All I have with any personality in my whole room is something you gave me.”\n\n“How do you know the picture is from me?”\n\nShe shrugs and tugs her skirt taut across her knees. “You have a unique style. Kind of like a thumbprint. I could tell it was yours because you only take pictures of things that people are too scared to stare at in real life.”\n\nShe doesn’t like my photographs, I guess.\n\n“So…” I ask, staring straight ahead. “Who’s this Brian guy?”\n\nShe picks up her phone and opens her texts. I’m trying to look over at them, knowing I’m too far away to read them, but I make the effort, anyway. I notice she tilts her phone slightly to the right, shielding it from my view. “I’m not sure,” she says. “I tried to scroll back and see if I could figure out anything from texts, but our messages are confusing. I can’t tell if I was dating him or you.”\n\nMy mouth is dry again. I take one of the drinks she brought with her and pop the top of it. I take a long sip and set it back in the cup holder. “Maybe you were messing around with both of us.” There’s an edge to my voice. I try to soften it. “What do his texts from today say?”\n\nShe locks the phone and turns it face down in her lap, almost as if she’s ashamed to look at it. She doesn’t answer me. I can feel my neck flush, and I recognize the warmth of the jealousy creeping through me like a virus. I don’t like it.\n\n“Text him back,” I say to her. “Tell him you don’t want him to text you anymore and that you want to work it out with me.”\n\nShe cuts her eyes in my direction. “We don’t know our situation,” she says. “What if I didn’t like you? What if we were both ready to break up?”\n\nI look back at the road and grind my teeth together. “I just think it’s better if we stick together until we figure out what happened. You don’t even know who this Brian guy is.”\n\n“I don’t know you, either,” she bites back.\n\nI pull into the parking lot of the school. She’s watching me closely, waiting on my response. I feel like I’m being baited.\n\nI park the car and turn it off. I grip the steering wheel with my right hand and my jaw with my left hand. I squeeze both. “How do we do this?”\n\n“Can you be a little more specific?” she says.\n\nI give my head the slightest shake. I don’t know if she’s even looking at me to notice. “I can’t be specific, because I’m referring to everything. To us, our families, our lives. How do we figure this out, Charlie? And how do we do it without finding things out about each other that are going to piss us off?”\n\nBefore she can answer me, someone exits a gate and begins walking toward us. He looks like me, but younger. Maybe a sophomore. He’s not as big as me yet, but from the looks of him, he’s probably going to pass me in size.\n\n“This should be fun,” she says, watching my little brother approach the car. He walks straight to the back passenger side and swings open the door. He tosses in a backpack, an extra pair of shoes, a gym bag, and finally, himself.\n\nThe door slams.\n\nHe pulls out his phone and begins scrolling through his texts. He’s breathing heavily. His hair is sweaty and matted to his forehead. We have the same hair. When he looks up at me, I see that we also have the same eyes.\n\n“What’s your problem?” he asks.\n\nI don’t respond to him. I turn back around in my seat and glance at Charlie. She has a smirk on her face and she’s texting someone. I almost want to grab her phone and see if she’s texting Brian, but my phone vibrates from her text as soon as she hits send.\n\nCharlie: Do you even know your little brother’s name?\n\nI have absolutely no idea what my own little brother’s name is.\n\n“Shit,” I say.\n\nShe laughs, but her laugh is cut short when she spots something in the parking lot. My gaze follows hers and lands on a guy. He’s stalking toward the car, glaring hard at Charlie.\n\nI recognize him. He’s the guy from the bathroom this morning. The one who tried to provoke me.\n\n“Let me guess,” I say. “Brian?”\n\nHe walks straight to the passenger door and opens it. He steps back and crooks his finger at Charlie. He ignores me completely, but he’s about to get to know me really well if he thinks he can summon Charlie this way.\n\n“We need to talk,” he says, his words clipped.\n\nCharlie puts her hand on the door to pull it shut. “Sorry,” she says. “We were just about to leave. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”\n\nDisbelief registers on his face, but so does a hefty dose of anger. As soon as I see him grab her by the arm and yank her toward him, I’m out of the vehicle and rounding the front of my car. I’m moving so fast, I slip on the gravel and have to grab the hood of the car to prevent myself from falling. Smooth. I rush around the passenger door, prepared to grab the bastard by his throat, but he’s bent over, groaning. His hand is covering his eye. He straightens up and glares at Charlie through his good eye.\n\n“I told you not to touch me,” Charlie says through clenched teeth. She’s standing next to her door, her hand still clenched in a fist.\n\n“You don’t want me to touch you?” he says with a smirk. “That’s a first.”\n\nJust as I begin to lunge toward him, Charlie shoves a hand against my chest. She shoots me a warning look, giving her head the slightest shake. I force a deep, calming breath and step back.\n\nCharlie focuses her attention back on Brian. “That was yesterday, Brian. Today’s a brand new day and I’m leaving with Silas. Got it?” She turns around and climbs back into the passenger seat. I wait until her door is shut and locked before I begin to walk back to the driver’s side.\n\n“She’s cheating on you,” Brian yells after me.\n\nI stop in my tracks.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\n7 phút mỗi ngày!

He’s standing upright now, and from the looks of his posture, he’s expecting me to hit him. When I don’t, he continues to provoke me.\n\n“With me,” he adds. “More than once. It’s been going on for over two months now.”\n\nI stare at him, trying to remain calm on the outside, but internally, my hands are wrapped around his throat, squeezing the last drop of oxygen from his lungs.\n\nI glance at Charlie. She’s begging me with her eyes not to do anything stupid. I turn back to face him and somehow, I smile. “That’s nice, Brian. You want a trophy?”\n\nI wish I could bottle up the expression on his face and release it any time I need a good laugh.\n\nOnce I’m back inside the car, I pull out of the parking lot more dramatically than I probably should. When we’re back on the road, heading toward my house, I finally find it in me to look at Charlie. She’s staring right back at me. We keep our eyes locked for a few seconds, gauging one another’s reaction. Right before I’m forced to look back at the road in front of me, I see her smile.\n\nWe both start laughing. She relaxes against her seat and says, “I can’t believe I was cheating on you with that guy. You must have done something that really pissed me off.”\n\nI smile at her. “Nothing short of murder should have made you cheat on me with that guy.”\n\nA throat clears in the backseat, and I immediately glance in the rearview mirror. I forgot all about my brother. He leans forward until he’s positioned between the front and middle seats. He looks at Charlie, and then at me.\n\n“Let me get this straight,” he says. “You two are laughing about this?”\n\nCharlie glances at me out of the corner of her eye. We both stop laughing and Charlie clears her throat. “How long have we been together now, Silas?” she asks.\n\nI pretend to count on my fingers when my brother speaks up. “Four years,” he interjects. “Jesus, what’s gotten into the two of you?”\n\nCharlie leans forward and locks eyes with me. I know exactly what she’s thinking.\n\n“Four years?” I mutter.\n\n“Wow,” Charlie says. “Long time.”\n\nMy brother shakes his head and falls back against his seat. “The two of you are worse than an episode of Jerry Springer.”\n\nJerry Springer is a talk show host. How do I know this? I wonder if Charlie remembers this.\n\n“You remember Jerry Springer?” I ask her.\n\nHer lips are tight, pressed together in contemplation. She nods and turns toward the passenger window.\n\nNone of this makes sense. How can we remember celebrities? People we’ve never met? How do I know that Kanye West married a Kardashian? How do I know that Robin Williams died?\n\nI can remember everyone I’ve never met, but I can’t remember the girl I’ve been in love with for over four years? Uneasiness takes over inside of me, pumping through my veins until it settles in my heart. I spend the next few miles silently naming off all the names and faces of people I remember. Presidents. Actors. Politicians. Musicians. Reality TV stars.\n\nBut I can’t for the life of me remember the name of my little brother, who is climbing out of the backseat right now. I watch him as he makes his way inside our house. I continue to watch the door, long after it closes behind him. I’m staring at my house just like Charlie was staring at hers.\n\n“Are you okay?” Charlie asks.\n\nIt’s as if the sound of her voice is suction, pulling me out of my head at breakneck speed and shoving me back into the moment. The moment where I picture Charlie and Brian and the words he said that I had to pretend didn’t affect me at all. “She’s cheating on you.”\n\nI close my eyes and lean my head against the headrest. “Why do you think it happened?”\n\n“You really do need to learn how to be more specific, Silas.”\n\n“Okay,” I reply, lifting my head and looking directly at her. “Brian. Why do you think you slept with him?”\n\nShe sighs. “You can’t be mad at me for that.”\n\nI tilt my head and look at her in disbelief. “We were together for four years, Charlie. You can’t blame me for being a little upset.”\n\nShe shakes her head. “They were together for four years. Charlie and Silas. Not the two of us,” she says. “Besides, who’s to say you were an angel? Have you even looked through all your own texts?”\n\nI shake my head. “I’m afraid to now. And don’t do that.”\n\n“Don’t do what?”\n\n“Don’t refer to us in the third person. You are her. And I’m him. Whether we like who we were or not.”\n\nAs soon as I begin to pull out of the driveway, Charlie’s phone rings.\n\n“My sister,” she says right before she answers it with a hello. She listens quietly for several seconds, eyeing me the entire time. “She was drunk when I got home. I’ll be there in a few minutes.” She ends the call. “Back to the school,” she says. “My alcoholic mother was supposed to pick my sister up after her swim practice. Looks like we’re about to meet another sibling.”\n\nI laugh. “I feel like I was a chauffer in my past life.”\n\nCharlie’s expression tightens. “I’ll stop referring to us in the third person if you stop referring to it as a past life. We didn’t die, Silas. We just can’t remember anything.”\n\n“We can remember some things,” I clarify.\n\nI begin to head back in the direction of the school. At least I’ll know my way around with all of this back and forth.\n\n“There was this family in Texas,” she says. “They had a parrot, but he went missing. Four years later, he showed up out of the blue—speaking Spanish.” She laughs. “Why do I remember that pointless story but I can’t remember what I did twelve hours ago?”\n\nI don’t respond, because her question is rhetorical, unlike all the questions in my head.\n\nWhen we pull up to the school again, a spitting image of Charlie is standing by the entrance with her hands crossed tightly over her chest. She climbs into the backseat and sits in the same spot where my brother was just sitting.\n\n“How was your day?” Charlie asks her.\n\n“Shut up,” her sister says.\n\n“Bad, I take it?”\n\n“Shut up,” she says again.\n\nCharlie looks at me wide-eyed, but with a mischievous grin on her face.\n\n“Were you waiting long?”\n\n“Shut up,” her sister says again.\n\nI realize now that Charlie is just instigating her. I smile when she keeps at it.\n\n“Mom was pretty wasted when I got home today.”\n\n“What’s new?” her sister says.\n\nAt least she didn’t say shut up this time.\n\nCharlie fires a couple more questions, but her sister ignores her completely, giving her full attention to the phone in her hands. When we pull into Charlie’s driveway, her sister begins to open her door before the car even comes to a stop.\n\n“Tell mom I’ll be late,” Charlie says as her sister climbs out of the car. “And when do you think Dad will be home?”\n\nHer sister pauses. She stares at Charlie with contempt. “Ten to fifteen, according to the judge.” She slams the door.\n\nI wasn’t expecting that, and apparently neither was Charlie. She slowly turns around in her seat until she’s facing forward again. She inhales a slow breath and carefully releases it. “My sister hates me. I live in a dump. My mom’s an alcoholic. My father is in prison. I cheat on you.” She looks at me. “Why the hell are you even dating me?”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nMen gan cao chính là vì đã mắc virus viêm gan B!

Hold her hand. Something. I don’t know what to do. There’s no protocol on how to console your girlfriend of four years who you just met this morning.\n\n“Well, according to Ezra, I’ve loved you since before I could walk. I guess that’s hard to let go of.”\n\nShe laughs under her breath. “You must have some fierce loyalty, because I’m even beginning to hate me.”\n\nI want to reach over and touch her cheek. Make her look at me. I don’t, though. I put the car in reverse and keep my hands to myself. “Maybe there’s a lot more to you than just your financial status and who your family is.”\n\n“Yeah,” she says. She glances at me and the disappointment is momentarily replaced by a brief smile. “Maybe.”\n\nI smile with her, but we both glance out our respective windows to hide them. Once we’re on the road again, Charlie reaches for the radio. She scrolls through several stations, settling on one that we both immediately begin singing. As soon as the first line of lyrics comes out of our mouths, we both immediately turn and face one another.\n\n“Lyrics,” she says softly. “We remember song lyrics.”\n\nNothing is adding up. At this point, my mind is so exhausted I don’t even feel like attempting to figure it out at the moment. I just want the respite the music provides. Apparently so does she, because she sits quietly beside me for most of the drive. After several minutes pass, I can feel her look at me.\n\n“I hate that I cheated on you.” She immediately turns up the volume on the radio and settles against her seat. She doesn’t want a response from me, but if she did I would tell her it was okay. That I forgive her. Because the girl sitting next to me right now doesn’t seem like she could be the girl who previously betrayed me.\n\nShe never asks where we’re going. I don’t even know where we’re going. I just drive, because driving seems to be the only time my mind settles down. I have no idea how long we drive, but the sun is finally setting when I decide to turn around and head back. We’re both lost in our heads the entire time, which is ironic for two people who have no memories.\n\n“We need to go through our phones,” I say to her. It’s the first thing spoken between us in over an hour. “Check old text messages, emails, voicemail. We might find something that could explain this.”\n\nShe pulls her phone out. “I tried that earlier, but I don’t have a fancy phone like yours. I only get text messages, but I barely have any.”\n\nI pull the car over at a gas station and park off to the side where it’s darker. I don’t know why I feel like we need privacy to do this. I just don’t want anyone approaching if they recognize us, because chances are, we won’t know them in return.\n\nI turn off the car and we both begin scrolling through our phones. I start with text messages between the two of us first. I scroll through several, but they’re all short and to the point. Schedules, times to meet up. I love you’s and miss you’s. Nothing revealing anything at all about our relationship.\n\nBased on my call log, we talk for at least an hour almost every night. I go through all the calls stored in my phone, which is well over two weeks’ worth.\n\n“We talked on the phone for at least an hour every night,” I tell her.\n\n“Really?” she says, genuinely shocked. “What in the world could we have talked about for an hour every night?”\n\nI grin. “Maybe we don’t actually do a whole lot of talking.”\n\nShe shakes her head with a quiet laugh. “Why do your sex jokes not surprise me, even though I remember absolutely nothing about you?”\n\nHer half-laugh turns into a groan. “Oh, God,” she says, tilting her phone toward me. “Look at this.” She scrolls through her phone’s camera roll with her finger. “Selfies. Nothing but selfies, Silas. I even took bathroom selfies.” She exits out of her camera app. “Kill me now.”\n\nI laugh and open the camera on my own phone. The first picture is of the two of us. We’re standing in front of a lake, taking a selfie, naturally. I show her and she groans even louder, dropping her head dramatically against the headrest. “I’m starting to not like who we are, Silas. You’re a rich kid who’s a dick to your housekeeper. I’m a mean teenager with absolutely no personality who takes selfies to make herself feel important.”\n\n“I’m sure we aren’t as bad as we seem. At least we appear to like each other.”\n\nShe laughs under her breath. “I was cheating on you. Apparently we weren’t that happy.”\n\nI open the email on my phone and find a video file labeled, “Do not delete.” I click on it.\n\n“Check this out.” I lift the armrest and scoot closer to her so she can see the video. I turn the car stereo up so the sound can be heard through Bluetooth. She lifts her armrest and scoots closer to get a better look.\n\nI hit play. My voice comes through the speakers of my car, making it apparent that I’m the one holding the camera in the video. It’s dark, and it looks like I’m outside.\n\n“It’s officially our two year anniversary.” My voice is hushed, like I don’t want to be caught doing whatever it is I’m doing. I turn the camera on myself and the light from the recorder is on, illuminating my face. I look younger, maybe by a year or two. I’m guessing I was sixteen based on the fact that I just said it was our two-year anniversary. I look like I’m sneaking up to a window.\n\n“I’m about to wake you up to tell you happy anniversary, but it’s almost one o’clock in the morning on a school night, so I’m filming this in case your father murders me.”\n\nI turn the camera back around and face it toward a window. The camera goes dark, but we can hear the window being raised and the sound of me struggling to climb inside. Once I’m inside the room, I shine the camera toward Charlie’s bed. There’s a lump under the covers, but she doesn’t move. I move the camera around the rest of the room. The first thing I notice is that the room on the camera doesn’t look like it would be a room in the house Charlie lives in now.\n\n“That’s not my bedroom,” Charlie says, looking closer at the video playing on my phone. “My room now isn’t even half that size. And I share with my little sister.”\n\nThe room on the video definitely doesn’t look like a shared room, but we don’t get a good enough look because the camera points back at the bed. The lump under the covers moves and from the angle of the camera, it looks as though I’m crawling onto the bed.\n\n“Charlie baby,” I whisper to her. She pulls the covers over her head but shields her eyes from the light of the camera.\n\n“Silas?” she whispers. The camera is still pointed at her from an awkward angle, as if I forgot I was even holding it. There are kissing sounds. I must be kissing up her arm or neck.\n\nJust the sound alone of my lips touching her skin is enough reason to turn off the video. I don’t want to make this awkward for Charlie, but she’s focused on my phone with as much intensity as I am. And not because of what’s happening between us on the video, but because we don’t remember it. It’s me…it’s her…it’s us together. But I don’t remember a single thing about this encounter, so it feels like we’re watching two complete strangers share an intimate moment.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

The camera pulls away and it looks like I move it to the pillow beside her head. The only view we have now is the profile of Charlie’s face as her head rests against her pillow.\n\nIt’s not the best view, but it’s enough to see that she looks exactly the same. Her dark hair is splayed out across the pillow. She’s looking up and I assume I’m hovering over her, but I can’t see myself in the video. I just see her mouth as it curls up into a smile.\n\n“You’re such a rebel,” she whispers. “I can’t believe you snuck in to tell me that.”\n\n“I didn’t sneak in to tell you that,” I whisper quietly. “I snuck in to do this.”\n\nMy face finally appears in the video, and my lips rest softly against hers.\n\nCharlie shifts in her seat next to me. I swallow the lump in my throat. I suddenly wish I were alone right now, watching this. I’d be replaying this kiss over and over and over.\n\nMy nerves are tight, and I realize it’s because I’m jealous of the guy in the video, which makes absolutely no sense. It feels like I’m watching a complete stranger make out with her, even though it’s me. Those are my lips against hers, but it’s pissing me off because I don’t remember what that feels like.\n\nI debate whether or not to stop the video, especially because the kiss that’s happening right now looks like it’s turning into more than just a simple kiss. My hand, which was resting against her cheek, is now out of view. From the sounds coming out of Charlie’s mouth in the video, it seems like she knows exactly where my hand is.\n\nShe pulls her mouth from mine and glances into the camera, just as her hand appears in front of the lens, knocking the camera face down onto the bed. The screen goes black, but the sound is still recording.\n\n“The light was blinding me,” she murmurs.\n\nMy finger is right next to the pause button on my phone. I should press pause, but I can feel the warmth of her breath escaping her mouth, flirting with the skin on my neck. Between that and the sounds coming from my speakers, I never want the video to end.\n\n“Silas,” she whispers.\n\nWe’re both still staring at the screen, even though it’s been pitch black since she knocked the camera over. There’s nothing to see, but we can’t look away. The sounds of our voices are playing all around us, filling the car, filling us.\n\n“Never never, Charlie,” I whisper.\n\nA moan.\n\n“Never never,” she whispers in response.\n\nA gasp.\n\nAnother moan.\n\nRustling.\n\nThe sound of a zipper.\n\n“I love you so much, Charlie.”\n\nSounds of bodies shifting on the bed.\n\nHeavy breaths. Lots of them. They’re coming from the speakers surrounding us and also from our mouths as we sit here and listen to this.\n\n“Oh, God…Silas.”\n\nTwo sharp intakes of breath.\n\nDesperate kissing.\n\nA horn blaring, swallowing up the sounds coming from my speakers.\n\nI fumble with the phone and it falls to the floorboard. Headlights are shining into my car. Fists are suddenly beating on Charlie’s window and before I can retrieve the phone from the floorboard, her door is being jerked open.\n\n“You feel incredible, Charlie,” my voice barrels through the speakers.\n\nLoud bursts of laughter escape the mouth of the girl who is now holding open Charlie’s door. She sat with us at lunch today, but I can’t remember her name.\n\n“Oh, my God!” she says, shoving Charlie in the shoulder. “Are you guys watching a sex tape?” She turns around and yells at the car whose headlights are still shining through the windows. “Char and Si are watching a sex tape!” She’s still laughing when I finally have the phone back in my hands and press pause. I turn the volume down on the car radio. Charlie looks from the girl to me, wide-eyed.\n\n“We were just leaving,” I say to the girl. “Charlie has to get home.”\n\nThe girl laughs with a shake of her head. “Oh, please,” she says, looking at Charlie. “Your mom is probably so drunk she thinks you’re in bed right now. Follow us, we’re headed out to Andrew’s.”\n\nCharlie smiles with a shake of her head. “I can’t, Annika. I’ll see you at school tomorrow, okay?” Annika looks overly offended. She scoffs when Charlie continues to pull the door shut, despite her being in the way. The girl steps aside and Charlie slams her door and locks it.\n\n“Drive,” she says.\n\nI do. Gladly.\n\nWe’re about a mile away from the gas station when Charlie clears her throat. It doesn’t help her voice because it still comes out in a raspy whisper. “You should probably delete that video.”\n\nI don’t like her suggestion. I was already planning on replaying it tonight when I get home. “There could be a clue in it,” I say to her. “I think I should watch it again. Listen to how it ends.”\n\nShe smiles, just as my phone indicates an incoming text. I flip it over and see a notification at the top of the screen from “Father.” I open my text messages.\n\nFather: Come home. Alone, please.\n\nI show the text to Charlie and she just nods. “You can drop me off at home.”\n\nThe rest of the ride is slightly uncomfortable. I feel like the video we just watched together has somehow made us see one another in a different light. Not necessarily a bad one, just a different one. Before, when I looked at her, she was just the girl who was experiencing this weird phenomenon with me. Now when I look at her, she’s the girl I supposedly make love to. The girl I’ve apparently made love to for a while. The girl I apparently still love. I just wish I could remember what it’s supposed to feel like.\n\nAfter seeing the obvious connection we once had, it only further confuses me that she was involved with that Brian guy. Thinking about him now fills me with a whole lot more anger and jealousy than it did before seeing us together in that video.\n\nWhen we pull into her driveway and stop, she doesn’t immediately get out. She stares up at the dark house in front of us. There’s a faint light on in a front window, but no sign of movement anywhere inside the house.\n\n“I’ll try to talk to my sister tonight. Maybe get more of an idea about what happened last night when I came home.”\n\n“That’s probably a good idea,” I tell her. “I’ll do the same with my brother. Maybe figure out what his name is while I’m at it.”\n\nShe laughs.\n\n“Want me to pick you up for school tomorrow?”\n\nShe nods. “If you don’t mind.”\n\n“I don’t.”\n\nIt’s quiet again. The silence reminds me of the soft sounds that were escaping her in the video that’s still on my phone, thank God. I’ll be hearing her voice in my head all night. I’m kind of looking forward to it, actually.\n\n“You know,” she says, tapping the door with her fingers. “We could wake up tomorrow and be perfectly fine. We might even forget today happened and everything will be back to normal.”\n\nWe can hope for it, but my instincts lead me to believe that won’t happen. We’re going to wake up tomorrow just as confused as we are right now.\n\n“I’d bet against it,” I say. “I’ll go through the rest of my emails and messages tonight. You should do the same.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nMen gan cao chính là vì đã mắc virus viêm gan B! Triệt tiêu ngay\nBí mật detox gan và tế bào hóa ra lại cực kì đơn giản và tiện lợi"

Call me if you…”\n\n“I’ll be fine,” she says quickly, cutting me off. “See you in the morning.” She exits the car and begins walking toward her house. I want to yell after her, tell her to wait. I want to know if she’s wondering the same thing I’m wondering: What does Never Never mean?\n\nI think if you cheat, it should be with someone worthy of your sin. I’m not sure if this is old Charlie’s thoughts or new Charlie’s thoughts. Or maybe, because I’m observing Charlie Wynwood’s life as an outsider, I’m able to think of her cheating with detachment rather than judgment. All I know is if you’re going to cheat on Silas Nash it had better be with Ryan Gosling.\n\nI turn back to look at him before he drives away and catch a glimpse of his profile, the dim streetlamp behind the car illuminating his face. The bridge of his nose isn’t smooth. At school, the other boys had pretty noses, or noses that were still too big for their faces. Or worse, noses pocked with acne. Silas has a grown-up nose. It makes you take him more seriously.\n\nI turn back to the house. My stomach feels oily. No one is around when I open the door and peer inside. I feel like I’m an intruder breaking into somebody’s house.\n\n“Hello?” I say. “Anyone here?” I close the door quietly behind me and tiptoe into the living room.\n\nI jump.\n\nCharlie’s mother is on the couch watching Seinfeld on mute, and eating pinto beans straight from the can. I’m suddenly reminded that all I’ve eaten today is the grilled cheese I split with Silas.\n\n“Are you hungry?” I ask her tentatively. I don’t know if she’s still mad at me or if she’s going to cry again. “Do you want me to make us something to eat?”\n\nShe leans forward without looking at me and slides her beans onto the coffee table. I take a step toward her and force out the word, “Mom?”\n\n“She’s not going to answer you.”\n\nI spin around to see Janette stroll into the kitchen, a bag of Doritos in her hand.\n\n“Is that what you ate for dinner?”\n\nShe shrugs.\n\n“What are you, like fourteen?”\n\n“What are you, like brain-dead?” she shoots back. And then, “Yes, I’m fourteen.”\n\nI grab the Doritos from her hand and carry them over to where drunken mommy is staring at the TV screen. “Fourteen-year-old girls can’t eat chips for dinner,” I say, dropping the bag on her lap. “Sober up and be a mom.”\n\nNo response.\n\nI stalk over to the fridge, but all that’s inside it is a dozen cans of Diet Coke and a jar of pickles. “Get your jacket, Janette,” I say, glaring at the mother. “Let’s get you some dinner.”\n\nJanette looks at me like I’m speaking Mandarin. I figure I need to throw something mean in there just to keep up appearances. “Hurry up, you little turd!”\n\nShe scampers back to our room while I search the house for car keys. What type of life was I living? And who was that creature on the couch? Surely she hadn’t always been that way. I glance at the back of her head and feel a spurt of sympathy. Her husband—my father—is in prison. Prison! That’s a big deal. Where are we even getting money to live?\n\nSpeaking of money, I check my wallet. The twenty-eight dollars is still there. That should be enough to buy us something other than Doritos.\n\nJanette comes out of the bedroom wearing a green jacket just as I find the keys. Green is a good color on her—makes her look less angsty teen.\n\n“Ready?” I ask.\n\nShe rolls her eyes.\n\n“Okay then, mommy dearest. Going to get some grub!” I call out before I close the door—mostly to see if she’ll try to stop me. I let Janette lead the way into the garage, anticipating what kind of car we drive. It isn’t going to be a Land Rover, that’s for sure.\n\n“Oh, boy,” I say. “Does this thing work?” She ignores me, popping her earbuds in as I eye the car. It’s a really old Oldsmobile. Older than me. It smells of cigarette smoke and old people. Janette climbs into the passenger side wordlessly and stares out the window. “Okay then, Chatty Cathy,” I say. “Let’s see how many blocks we can go before this thing breaks down.”\n\nI have a plan. The receipt I found is dated last Friday and is from The Electric Crush Diner in the French Quarter. Except this piece of crap car doesn’t have GPS. I’ll have to find it on my own.\n\nJanette is quiet as we pull out of the driveway. She traces patterns on the window with her fingertip, fogging and re-fogging the glass with her breath. I watch her out of the corner of my eye; poor kid. Her mom’s an alcoholic and her dad is in prison—kind of sad. She also hates me. That pretty much leaves her alone in the world. I realize with surprise that Charlie is in the same situation. Except maybe she has Silas—or did have Silas before she cheated on him with Brian. Ugh. I shake my shoulders to get rid of all my feels. I hate these people. They’re so annoying. Except I kind of like Silas.\n\nKind of.\n\nThe Electric Crush Diner is on North Rampart Street. I find a parking spot on a crowded corner and have to parallel park between a truck and a MINI Cooper. Charlie is an excellent parallel parker, I think proudly. Janette climbs out after me and stands on the sidewalk, looking lost. The diner is across the street. I try to peer in through the windows, but they’re mostly blacked out. The Electric Crush flashes in pink neon over the front door.\n\n“Come on,” I say. I hold out my hand to her and she draws back. “Janette! Let’s go!” I march up to her in what can only be an aggressive Charlie move, and grab her hand. She tries to pull away from me, but I hold on tight, dragging her across the street. “Let. Me. Go!”\n\nAs soon as we reach the other side, I spin around to face her. “What’s your problem? Stop acting like a…,” fourteen-year-old, I finish in my head.\n\n“What?” she says. “And why do you even care what I act like?” Her bottom lip is puffing out like she’s about to cry. I suddenly feel very sorry for being so rough with her. She’s just a little kid with tiny boobs and a hormone-addled brain.\n\n“You’re my sister,” I say gently. “It’s time we stick together, don’t you think?” For a minute, I think she’s going to say something—maybe something soft and nice and sisterly—but then she stomps toward the diner ahead of me and flings open the door. Damn. She’s a tough cookie. I follow her in—a little sheepishly—and stop dead in my tracks.\n\nIt’s not what I thought it was going to be. It’s not really a diner—more like a club with booths lining the walls. In the middle of the room is what looks like a dance floor. Janette is standing near the bar, looking around in bewilderment.\n\n“You come here often?” she asks me.\n\nI look from the black leather booths to the black marble floors. Everything is black aside from the bright pink signs on the walls. It’s morbid and bubblegum.\n\n“Help you?” A man steps out from a door at the far end of the bar, carrying an armful of boxes. He’s young—maybe early twenties. I like him on sight because he’s wearing a black vest over a pink t-shirt. Charlie must like pink.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\n7 phút mỗi ngày!

He walks over and places two hands on the table.\n\n“Charlie, right?” he asks. I nod dumbly. How does he…? How many times have I…?\n\n“The kitchen was making me a roast chicken. What do you say I share it with you guys? We won’t get busy for a couple more hours, anyway.”\n\nI nod again.\n\n“Good.” He hits the table with his palm and Janette jumps. He points to her. “Coke? Sprite? Shirley Temple?”\n\nShe rolls her eyes. “Diet Coke,” she says.\n\n“And you, Charlie?”\n\nI don’t like the way he says my name. It’s too…familiar. “Coke,” I say quickly. When he leaves, Janette leans forward, her eyebrows drawn together. “You always get diet,” she says accusatorily.\n\n“Yeah? Well I’m not quite feeling like myself.”\n\nShe makes a little noise in the back of her throat. “No kidding,” she says. I ignore her and try to get a good look around. What were Silas and I doing here? Is it a place we came often? I lick my lips.\n\n“Janette,” I say. “Have I ever told you about this place?”\n\nShe looks surprised. “You mean all the times we have heart-to-hearts when we put the lights out at night?”\n\n“Okay, okay, I get it. I’m a really crappy sister. Geez. Get over it already. I’m extending the olive branch here.”\n\nJanette scrunches up her nose. “What’s that mean?”\n\nI sigh. “I’m trying to make it up to you. Start fresh.”\n\nJust then the pink t-shirt dude brings us our drinks. He brought Janette a Shirley Temple even though she asked for a diet coke. Her face registers disappointment.\n\n“She wanted a diet coke,” I say.\n\n“She’ll like that,” he says. “When I was a kid…”\n\n“Just get her a diet coke.”\n\nHe holds up his hands in surrender. “Sure thing, princess.”\n\nJanette glances at me from under her eyelashes. “Thanks,” she says.\n\n“No problem,” I say. “You can’t trust a guy who wears a pink shirt.” She sort of smirks and I feel triumphant. I can’t believe I thought I liked that guy. I can’t believe I liked Brian. What the hell was wrong with me?\n\nI pick up my phone and see that Silas has texted me multiple times. Silas. I like Silas. Something about his soothing voice and good boy manners. And his nose—he has a wicked cool nose.\n\nSilas: My dad…\n\nSilas: Where are you?\n\nSilas: Hello?\n\nThe guy comes back with the chicken and a plate of mashed potatoes. It’s a lot of food.\n\n“What’s your name again?” I ask.\n\n“You’re such a bitch, Charlie,” He says, laying a plate down in front of me. He glances at Janette. “Sorry,” he says.\n\nShe shrugs. “What is your name?” she asks through a mouthful of food.\n\n“Dover. That’s what my friends call me.”\n\nI nod. Dover.\n\n“So last weekend…,” I say.\n\nDover bites. “Yeah, that was crazy. I didn’t expect to see you back here this soon.”\n\n“Why not?” I ask. I’m trying to be casual, but my insides are jumping around like they’re being shocked.\n\n“Well, your man was pretty pissed. I thought he was going to blow his shit before he got kicked out.”\n\n“Blow his shit…?” I change my tone so it’s not so much a question. “Blow his shit. Yeah. That was…”\n\n“You looked pretty pissed,” Dover says. “I can’t blame you. You might have liked it here if Silas hadn’t ruined it for you.”\n\nI sit back, the chicken suddenly unappealing. “Yeah,” I say, glancing at Janette, who is watching us both curiously.\n\n“You finished, brat?” I ask her. She nods, wiping her greasy fingers on a napkin. I pull a twenty out of my purse and drop it on the table.\n\n“No need,” Dover says, waving it away.\n\nI lean down till we are eye to eye. “Only my boyfriend gets to buy me dinner,” I say, leaving the money on the table. I walk to the door, Janette trailing behind me.\n\n“Yeah, well,” Dover calls, “you live by that rule, you can eat for free seven days a week!”\n\nI don’t stop until I reach the car. Something happened in there. Something that made Silas almost lose his shit. I start the car and Janette lets out a loud burp. We both start laughing at the same time.\n\n“No more Doritos for dinner,” I tell her. “We can learn to cook.”\n\n“Sure,” she shrugs.\n\nEveryone breaks their promises to Janette. She’s got that bitter air about her. We don’t speak for the rest of the ride home, and when I pull into the garage, she jumps out before I’ve turned off the engine.\n\n“Nice spending time with you, too,” I call after her. I imagine that when I walk in, Charlie’s mother will be waiting for her—perhaps to chew her out for taking the car—but when I step into the house, everything is dark except for the light underneath the door to Janette’s and my bedroom. Mother has gone to sleep. Mother doesn’t care. It’s perfect for the situation I’m in. I get to snoop around and try to figure out what happened to me without the questions and rules, but I can’t help thinking about Janette—about how she’s just a little kid who needs her parents. Everything is so screwed up.\n\nJanette is listening to music when I open the door.\n\n“Hey,” I say. I suddenly have an idea. “Have you seen my iPod?” Music tells a lot about a person. I don’t have to have a memory to know that.\n\n“I don’t know,” she shrugs. “Maybe it’s with all your other crap in the attic.”\n\nMy other crap?\n\nThe attic?\n\nI suddenly feel excited.\n\nMaybe there’s more to me than a bland bedspread and a stack of bad novels. I want to ask her what kind of crap, and why my crap is in the attic instead of in our shared bedroom, but Janette has stuck the buds back in her ears and is working hard to ignore me.\n\nI decide the best route would be to go up to the attic to check things out for myself. Now, where is the attic?\n\nThe front door to my house opens as I’m putting my car in park, and Ezra walks outside, wringing her hands together nervously. I get out of the car and walk to where she’s standing, wide-eyed.\n\n“Silas,” she says, her voice quivering. “I thought he knew. I wouldn’t have mentioned Charlie was here, but you didn’t seem to be hiding it, so I thought things had changed and she was allowed over here...”\n\nI hold up my hand to stop her from more unnecessary apologies. “It’s fine, Ezra. Really.”\n\nShe sighs and runs her hand across the apron she’s still wearing. I don’t understand her nervousness, or why she anticipated I would be angry with her. I shove more reassurance into my smile than is probably necessary, but she looks as if she needs it.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

I pause in the foyer, not quite familiar enough with the house to know where my father would be at the moment. Ezra passes me, muttering a “goodnight,” and heads up the stairs. She must live here.\n\n“Silas.”\n\nIt sounds like my voice, but more worn. I turn and am suddenly face to face with the man in all the family photos lining the walls. He’s missing the brilliantly fake smile, though.\n\nHe eyes me up and down, as if the mere sight of his son disappoints him.\n\nHe turns and walks through a door leading out of the foyer. His silence and the assurance in his steps demand I follow him, so I do. We walk into his study, and he slowly edges around his desk and takes a seat. He leans forward and folds his arms over the mahogany wood. “Care to explain?”\n\nI’m tempted to explain. I really am. I want to tell him that I have no idea who he is, no idea why he’s angry, no idea who I am.\n\nI should probably be nervous or intimidated by him. I’m sure yesterday’s Silas would have been, but it’s hard to feel intimidated by someone I don’t know at all. As far as I’m concerned, he has no power over me, and power is the primary ingredient of intimidation.\n\n“Care to explain what?” I ask.\n\nMy eyes move to a shelf of books on the wall behind him. They look like classics. Collectibles. I wonder if he’s read any of the books or if they’re just more ingredients for his intimidation.\n\n“Silas!” His voice is so deep and sharp; it feels like the tip of a knife piercing my ears. I press my hand against the side of my neck and squeeze before looking at him again. He eyes the chair across from him, silently commanding me to sit down.\n\nI get the feeling yesterday’s Silas would be saying, “Yes, sir,” right about now.\n\nToday’s Silas smiles and walks slowly to his seat.\n\n“Why was she inside this house today?”\n\nHe’s referring to Charlie like she’s poison. He’s referring to her the same way her mother referred to me. I look down at the arm of the chair and pick at a piece of worn leather. “She wasn’t feeling well at school. She needed a ride home, and we took a quick detour.”\n\nThis man…my father…leans back in his chair. He brings a hand up to his jaw and rubs it.\n\nFive seconds pass.\n\nTen seconds pass.\n\nFifteen.\n\nHe finally leans forward again. “You seeing her again?”\n\nIs this a trick question? Because it feels like one.\n\nIf I say yes, it’ll obviously piss him off. If I say no, it feels like I’ll be letting him win. I don’t know why, but I really don’t want this man to win. He seems like he’s accustomed to winning.\n\n“What if I am?”\n\nHis hand is no longer rubbing his jaw because it’s now moving across the desk, fisting into the collar of my shirt. He yanks me toward him just as my hands grip the edges of the desk for resistance. We’re eye to eye now, and I expect he’s about to hit me. I wonder if this type of interaction with him is common?\n\nInstead of hitting me like I know he wants to, he pushes his fist against my chest and releases me. I fall back into my seat, but only for a second. I push out of my chair and take a few steps back.\n\nI probably should have hit the asshole, but I don’t hate him enough to do that yet. I also don’t like him enough to be affected by his reaction. It does confuse me, though.\n\nHe picks up a paperweight and hurls it across the room, luckily not in my direction. It smashes against a wooden shelf and knocks the contents to the floor. A few books. A picture frame. A rock.\n\nI stand still and watch him pace back and forth, beads of sweat dripping from his forehead. I don’t understand why he could possibly be this upset over the fact that Charlie was here today. Especially since Ezra said we grew up together.\n\nHis palms are now flat against the desk. He’s breathing heavily, nostrils flaring like a raging bull. I expect him to start kicking up dust with his foot any second now. “We had an understanding, Silas. Me and you. I wasn’t going to push you to testify if you swore to me you wouldn’t see that man’s daughter again.” One of his hands flail toward a locked cabinet while his other hand runs through what’s left of his thinning hair. “I know you don’t think she took those files from this office, but I know she did! And the only reason I haven’t pursued it further is because you swore to me we wouldn’t have to deal with that family again. And here you are…” He shudders. Literally shudders. “Here you are bringing her to this house like the last twelve months never even happened!” More frustrated hand flailing, twisted facial expressions. “That girl’s father almost ruined this family, Silas! Does that not mean a damn thing to you?”\n\nNot really, I want to say.\n\nI make a mental note to never get this angry. It’s not an attractive look on a Nash.\n\nI search for some sort of emotion that conveys remorse, so that he can see it on my face. It’s hard though, when the only thing I’m experiencing is curiosity.\n\nThe door to the office opens and we both move our attention to whomever is entering.\n\n“Landon, this doesn’t concern you,” my father says, his voice soft. I briefly face my father again, just to make sure the words actually fell from his mouth and not someone else’s. It almost sounds like the voice of a caring father, rather than the monster I just witnessed.\n\nLandon—nice to finally know my little brother’s name—looks at me. “Coach is on the phone for you, Silas.”\n\nI glance back at my father, who now has his back turned to me. I assume that means our conversation is over. I walk toward the door and gladly exit the room, followed closely by Landon.\n\n“Where’s the phone?” I ask him when I reach the stairs. Valid question, though. How am I supposed to know if he called on a cell phone or a landline?\n\nLandon laughs and moves past me. “There’s no phone call. I was just getting you out of there.”\n\nHe continues up the stairs and I watch as he reaches the top and then turns left, disappearing down the hall. He’s a good brother, I think. I make my way to what I assume is his room, and I knock lightly on the door. It’s slightly ajar, so I push it open. “Landon?” I open the door all the way and he’s seated at a desk. He looks over his shoulder briefly and then returns his attention to his computer. “Thanks,” I say, stepping into the room. Do brothers thank each other? Probably not. I should have said something along the lines of, “Took you long enough, asshole.”\n\nLandon turns in his chair and tilts his head. A combination of confusion and admiration plays out in his smile. “I’m not sure what your deal is. You aren’t showing up for practice, and that’s never happened. You act like you don’t give a shit that Charlie has been screwing Brian Finley. And then you have the balls to bring her here? After all the shit Dad and Brett went through?” He shakes his head. “I’m surprised you escaped his office without a bloodbath.”\n\nHe spins back around and leaves me to process everything. I turn and rush toward my bedroom.\n\nBrett Wynwood, Brett Wynwood, Brett Wynwood.\n\nI repeat his name in my head so I’ll know exactly what to search when I get to my computer. Surely I have a computer.\n\nWhen I reach my room, the first thing I do is walk to my dresser. I pick up the pen Charlie handed me earlier today and read the imprint again.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nMen gan cao chính là vì đã mắc virus viêm gan B!

I power it on and enter the password.\n\nI remember the password? Add that to the list of shit that makes no sense.\n\nI type Wynwood-Nash Financial Group into the search engine. I click on the first result and am taken to a page that reads, “Nash Finance,” with the Wynwood noticeably absent. I scroll quickly through the page and discover nothing that helps. Just a bunch of useless company contact information.\n\nI back out of the page and scroll through the rest of the results, reading each of the leading headlines and the articles that follow:\n\nFinance gurus, Clark Nash and Brett Wynwood, co-founders of Wynwood-Nash Financial Group, have been charged with four counts of conspiracy, fraud and illegal trading.\n\nPartners for over twenty years, the two business moguls are now placing the blame on each other, both claiming to have no knowledge of the illegal practices uncovered during a recent investigation.\n\nI read another.\n\nClark Nash cleared of charges. Company co-chair, Brett Wynwood, sentenced to fifteen years for fraud and embezzlement.\n\nI make it to the second page of search results when the battery light begins to flash on the laptop. I open the drawer, but there’s no charger. I look everywhere. Under the bed, in the closet, in my dresser drawers.\n\nThe laptop dies during my search. I begin to use my phone to research, but it’s about to die, too, and the only phone charger I can find plugs into a laptop. I keep looking because I need to know exactly what happened to make these two families hate each other so much.\n\nI lift the mattress, thinking maybe the charger could be stuck behind the bed somehow. I don’t find the charger, but I do find what looks like a notebook. I slide it out from under the mattress and then take a seat on top of the bed. Right when I open it up to the first page, my phone vibrates with an incoming text.\n\nCharlie: How are things with your father?\n\nI want to learn more before deciding what I want to share with her. I ignore the text and open the notebook to find stacks of papers stuffed into a folder. Across the top, the papers all read “Wynwood-Nash Financial Group,” but I don’t understand any of them. I also don’t understand why these were hidden beneath my mattress.\n\nClark Nash’s words from downstairs repeat in my head—I know you don’t think she took those files from this office, Silas, but I know she did.\n\nLooks like he was wrong, but why would I have taken them? What would I have needed with them?\n\nWho was I trying to protect?\n\nMy phone buzzes again with another text.\n\nCharlie: There’s this really neat feature on your phone called, “read receipts.” If you’re going to ignore texts, you should probably turn that off. ;)\n\nAt least she put a winky face.\n\nMe: Not ignoring you. Just tired. We have a lot to figure out tomorrow.\n\nCharlie: Yeah\n\nThat’s all she says. I’m not sure if I should respond to her effortless reply, but I don’t want her to be irritated if I don’t respond.\n\nMe: Goodnight, Charlie baby. ;)\n\nAs soon as I hit send, I want to retract it. I don’t know what I was going for with that reply. Not sarcasm, but definitely not flirtation, either.\n\nI decide to regret it tomorrow. Right now I just need sleep so I can make sure I’m awake enough in the morning to deal with all of this.\n\nI shove the notebook back under the mattress and see a wall charger, so I plug it into my phone. I’m too exhausted to keep searching tonight, so I kick off my shoes. It isn’t until I lie down that I notice Ezra changed my sheets.\n\nAs soon as I turn the lamp off and close my eyes, my phone vibrates.\n\nCharlie: Goodnight, Silas.\n\nHer lack of endearment doesn’t go unnoticed, but for some inexplicable reason, the text still makes me smile. Typical Charlie.\n\nI think.\n\nIt is not a good night.\n\nThe trapdoor to the attic is in the closet I share with my sister. After I text Silas goodnight, I climb the three shelves—which are bursting with fabric—and push upward with my fingertips until it shifts left. I glance back over my shoulder and see that Janette hasn’t looked up from her phone. This must be normal—me climbing into the attic, leaving her behind. I want to ask if she’ll come with me, but it was exhausting just to get her to come to dinner. Another time, I think. I’ll figure out how to fix things between us.\n\nI don’t know why, but as I hoist myself through the hole and into an even smaller space, I picture Silas’s face; the tan, smooth skin. His full lips. How many times had I tasted his mouth and yet I can’t remember a single kiss.\n\nThe air is warm and stuffy. I crawl on my knees to a pile of pillows and press my back to them, straightening my legs out in front of me. There’s a flashlight standing atop a pile of books. I click it on, examining their spines; stories I know, but don’t remember reading. How odd to be made of flesh, balanced on bone, and filled with a soul you’ve never met.\n\nI pick up her books one by one and read the first page of each. I want to know who she is—who I am. When I’ve exhausted the pile, I find a larger book at the bottom, bound in creased red leather. My immediate thought is that I’ve found a journal. My hands shake as I fold open the pages.\n\nNot a journal. A scrapbook. Letters from Silas.\n\nI know this because he signs each one with a sharp S that almost looks like a lightening bolt. And I know I like his handwriting, direct and distinct. Paper-clipped to the top of each note is a photo—presumably one that Silas has taken. I read one note after another, pouring over words. Love letters. Silas is in love.\n\nIt’s beautiful.\n\nHe likes to imagine a life with me. In one letter, written on the back of a brown paper sack, he details the way we will spend Christmas when we have our own place: spiked apple cider by the Christmas tree, raw cookie dough that we eat before we get the chance to bake it. He tells me he wants to make love to me with only candles lighting the room so that he can see my body glow in the candle light. The photo paper clipped to the note is of a tiny Christmas tree that looks like it’s in his bedroom. We must have set it up together.\n\nI find another written on the back of a receipt in which he details what it feels like to be inside of me. My face grows warm as I read the note over and over, reveling in his lust. The photo paper clipped to this one is of my bare shoulder. His photos pack a punch—just like his words. They take my breath, and I’m not sure if the part of me I can’t remember is in love with him. I feel only curiosity toward the dark-haired boy who looks at me so earnestly.\n\nI set the note aside, feeling like I’m snooping on someone else’s life, and close the book. This belonged to Charlie. I’m not her. I fall asleep surrounded by Silas’s words, the sprinkling of letters and sentences swirling around in my head until…\n\nA girl drops to her knees in front of me. “Listen to me,” she whispers. “We don’t have much time…”\n\nBut I don’t listen to her. I push her away and then she’s gone. I am standing outside. There is a fire burning from an old metal trash can. I rub my hands together to get warm. From somewhere behind me I can hear a saxophone playing, but the sound morphs into a scream. That’s when I run. I run through the fire that was in the trash can, but now it is everywhere, licking the buildings along the street.. I run, choking on smoke until I see one pink-faced storefront that is free of flame and smoke, though everything around it burns. It is a shop of curiosities. I open the door without thought because it is the only place safe from the flames. Silas is there waiting for me. He leads me past bones and books and bottles and takes me to a back room. A woman sits on a throne made of broken mirror, staring down at me with a thin smile on her lips. The pieces of mirror reflect slices of light across the walls where they jiggle and dance. I turn to look at Silas, to ask him where we are, but he’s gone. “Hurry!”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

I wipe the sleep from my eyes and follow her down the three shelves to our room. I’m touched she knows I’m out of skip days, and that she cared enough to wake me up. I’m shaking when I reach the bathroom and turn on the shower. I haven’t shaken the dream. I can still see my reflection in the broken shards of her throne.\n\nThe fire swims in and out of my vision, waiting behind my eyelids every time I blink. If I concentrate, I can smell the ash above the body wash I’m using, above the sickeningly sweet shampoo I pour into my hand. I close my eyes and try to remember Silas’s words…You are warm and wet, and your body grips me like it doesn’t want me to leave.\n\nJanette pounds on the door. “Late!” she yells.\n\nI hurry to dress and we’re tumbling out the front door before I realize I don’t even know how Janette expects we’re getting to school today. I told Silas to pick me up yesterday.\n\n“Amy should be here already,” Janette says. She folds her arms across her chest and peers down the street. It’s like she can’t even stand to look at me. I pull out my phone and text Silas to let him know not to pick me up. I also check to see if this Amy has texted me, right as a little silver Mercedes whips around the corner.\n\n“Amy,” I say. I wonder if she’s one of the girls I sat with at lunch yesterday. I hardly noticed names and faces. The car pulls to the curb and we walk forward. Janette climbs into the backseat without a word, and after a few seconds of deliberation I open the front door. Amy is black. I stare at her in surprise for a minute before I climb in the car.\n\n“Hey,” she says, without looking over. I’m grateful for her distraction because I have a moment to study her.\n\n“Hi.”\n\nShe’s pretty; her hair, which is lighter than her skin, is braided to her waist. She seems at ease with me—not to mention she’s giving my sour sister and me a ride to school. We must be good friends, I decide.\n\n“Glad to see you’re feeling better. Did you figure out what you’re going to do about Silas?” she asks me.\n\n“I…I…er…Silas?”\n\n“Uh huh,” she says. “That’s what I thought. You still don’t know. It’s a shame, too, because you guys can be really good together when you try.”\n\nI sit in silence until we’ve almost reached the school, wondering what she means. “Amy,” I say. “How would you describe my relationship with Silas to someone who has never met us?”\n\n“See, this is your problem,” she says. “You always want to play games.” She pulls up to the front of the school and Janette climbs out. It’s all like clockwork.\n\n“Bye,” I call as the door closes.\n\n“She’s so mean,” I say, facing forward again.\n\nAmy pulls a face. “And you’re queen of nice? Seriously, I don’t know what’s come over you. You’re even more out of it than normal. ”\n\nI chew on my lips as we pull into the high school parking lot. I open the door before the car has even stopped.\n\n“What the hell, Charlie?”\n\nI don’t wait to hear what else she has to say. I run for the school, my arms wrapped tightly around my torso. Did everyone hate me? I duck my head as I push through the doors. I need to find Silas. People are looking at me as I walk the hallway. I don’t look left or right, but I can feel their eyes. When I reach for my phone to text Silas, it’s gone. I ball up my fists. I had my phone when I texted and told him I didn’t need a ride. I must have left it in Amy’s car.\n\nI’m on my way back toward the parking lot when someone calls my name.\n\nBrian.\n\nI glance around to see who’s watching us as he jogs toward me. His eye still looks a little bruised from where I punched him. I like that.\n\n“What?” I say.\n\n“You hit me.” He stops a few feet away like he’s afraid I’m going to do it again. I suddenly feel guilty. I shouldn’t have done that. Whatever game I’d been playing with him before all of this happened wasn’t his fault.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I say. “I haven’t been myself lately. I shouldn’t have done that.”\n\nIt looks like I’ve told him exactly what he wants to hear. His face relaxes and he runs a hand along the back of his neck as he looks at me.\n\n“Can we go somewhere more private to talk?”\n\nI look around at the crowded hallway and shake my head. “No.”\n\n“All right,” he says. “Then we can do this here.” I shift from one foot to another and look over my shoulder. Depending on how long he takes, I can still catch Amy and get the keys to her car and…\n\n“It’s Silas or me.”\n\nMy head jerks back to look at him. “What?”\n\n“I love you, Charlie.”\n\nOh, God. I feel itchy all over. I take a step back, looking around for someone to help me get out of this. “Now is a really bad time for me, Brian. I need to find Amy and—”\n\n“I know you guys have history, but you’ve been unhappy for a long time. That guy’s a dick, Charlie. You saw what happened with the shrimp. I’m surprised—”\n\n“What are you talking about?”\n\nHe looks put out that I’ve interrupted his speech.\n\n“I’m talking about Silas and—”\n\n“No, the shrimp thing.” People are stopping to watch us now. Clusters of nosiness form at lockers; eyes, eyes, eyes on my face. I’m so uncomfortable with this. I hate it.\n\n“Her,” Brian jerks his head left just as a girl pushes through the doors and makes her way past us. When she sees me looking, her face turns a bright pink color, like a shrimp. I recognize her from my class yesterday. She was the one on the floor, picking up the books. She’s tiny. Her hair is an ugly shade of greenish brown, like she tried to dye it herself and it went terribly wrong. But even if she hadn’t dyed it, it looks…sad. Jagged, uneven bangs, oily and lank. She has a smattering of pimples across her forehead and a nose that’s pugged. My first thought is ugly. But it’s more of a fact than a judgment. She skitters away before I can blink, disappearing into a crowd of onlookers. I have a feeling she hasn’t left. She’s waiting right behind their backs—she wants to hear. I felt something…when I saw her face I felt something.\n\nMy head is swimming when Brian reaches for me. I let him grab me by the elbow and pull me toward his chest.\n\n“It’s me or Silas,” he says again. He’s being bold since I already punched him for touching me. But I’m not thinking about him. I’m thinking about the girl, the shrimp, wondering if she’s back there, hiding behind everyone else. “I need an answer, Charlie.” He has me so close that when I look into his face I can see the freckles in his eyes. “Then my answer is Silas,” I say softly.\n\nHe freezes. I can feel the stiffening of his body.\n\n“You gonna show up for practice today?” Landon asks. He’s already standing outside my door and I don’t even remember pulling into the parking lot of the school, much less turning off the car. I nod, but fail to make eye contact with him. I’d been so lost inside my own thoughts during the drive over, I didn’t even think to prod him for information.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

I was hoping Charlie was right—that we would wake up and everything would be back to normal. But we didn’t and it’s not.\n\nOr at least I didn’t wake up with memories. I haven’t spoken to Charlie since last night, and her text this morning revealed nothing.\n\nI didn’t even open the text. It flashed on my lock screen and I read enough of the first sentence to know I didn’t like how it made me feel. My thoughts immediately wandered to who might be picking her up and if she was okay with it.\n\nMy protective instincts kick in whenever it comes to her, and I don’t know if it’s always been that way or if it’s because she’s the only one I can relate to right now.\n\nI get out of the car, determined to find her. Make sure she’s okay, even though I know she more than likely is. I don’t have to know any more about her to know that she doesn’t really need me to take care of her. She’s fiercely independent.\n\nThat doesn’t mean I won’t still try.\n\nWhen I enter the school, it occurs to me that I don’t know where to begin searching for her. Neither of us can remember which lockers are ours, and considering this happened to us both during fourth period yesterday, we have no idea where our first, second or third period classes are.\n\nI decide to walk to the administration office and see about getting a new copy of my schedule. Hopefully Charlie thought to do the same, because I doubt they’ll give me hers.\n\nThe secretary is unfamiliar, but she smiles knowingly at me. “Here to see Ms. Ashley, Silas?”\n\nMs. Ashley.\n\nI start to shake my head no, but she’s already pointing me in the direction of an open office door. Whoever Ms. Ashley is, I must visit her enough that my presence in the office isn’t unusual.\n\nBefore I make it to the open office door, a woman steps out. She’s tall, attractive and appears extremely young to be an employee. Whatever she does here, she hasn’t been doing it long. She barely looks old enough to be out of college.\n\n“Mr. Nash,” she says with a vague smile, flicking her blonde hair back over her shoulder. “Do you have an appointment?”\n\nI pause and stop my advancement toward her. I glance back at the secretary right when Ms. Ashley waves it off. “It’s fine, I have a few minutes. Come inside.”\n\nI move gingerly past her, taking in the nameplate on the door as I enter her office.\n\nAVRIL ASHLEY, GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.\n\nShe closes the door behind me and I look around the office, which is decorated in motivational quotes and typical posters portraying positive messages. I suddenly feel uncomfortable. Trapped. I should have said I didn’t need to see her, but I’m hoping this counselor—one I apparently visited regularly—will know a few things about my past that may be of help to Charlie and me.\n\nI turn, just as Ms. Ashley’s hand slides down the door and reaches the lock. She turns it and then begins to saunter toward me. Her hands meet my chest and right before her mouth connects with mine, I stumble backward and catch myself on a filing cabinet.\n\nWhoa.\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nShe looks offended that I just shook off her advance. This must not be unusual behavior with us.\n\nI’m sleeping with the guidance counselor?\n\nI immediately think of Charlie and, based on our obvious non-commitment to one another, I question what kind of relationship we had. Why were we even together?\n\n“Is something wrong?” Ms. Ashley says.\n\nI turn slightly and take a few steps away from her, toward the window. “Not feeling very well today.” I look her in the eyes and force a smile. “Don’t want to get you sick.”\n\nMy words put her at ease and she closes the space between us again, this time leaning in and pressing her lips against my neck. “Poor thing,” she purrs. “Want me to make you feel better?”\n\nMy eyes are wide, darting around the room, mapping out my escape route. My attention falls to the computer on her desk, and then a printer behind her chair. “Ms. Ashley,” I say, gently pushing her away from my neck.\n\nThis is wrong on so many levels.\n\nShe laughs. “You never call me that when we’re alone. It’s weird.”\n\nShe’s too comfortable with me. I need to get out of here.\n\n“Avril,” I say, smiling at her again. “I need a favor. Can you print a copy of mine and Charlie’s schedules?”\n\nShe immediately straightens up, her smile whisked away at the mention of Charlie’s name. Point of contention, apparently.\n\n“I’m thinking about switching a couple of my classes so I won’t have to be around her as much.” Couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nMs. Ashley—Avril—slides her fingers down my chest, the smile reappearing on her face. “Well, it’s about time. Finally decided to take the counselor’s advice, I see.”\n\nHer voice drips with sex. I can see how things must have started up with her, but it makes me feel shallow. It makes me hate who I was.\n\nI shift on my feet as she works her way to her seat and begins clicking at her keyboard.\n\nShe pulls freshly printed pages from the printer and walks them over to me. I attempt to take the schedules from her hand, but she pulls them away with a grin. “Uh-uh,” she says, shaking her head slowly. “These are gonna cost you.” She leans against her desk and lays the sheets of paper beside her, face down. She brings her eyes back to mine and I can see I’m not leaving without appeasing her, which is the last thing I want to do right now.\n\nI take two slow steps toward her and rest my hands on either side of her. I lean in to her neck and can hear her gasp when I begin to speak. “Avril, I only have five minutes left before I have to be in class. There’s no way I can do all the things I want to do to you in just five minutes.”\n\nI slip my hand to the schedules lying on her desk and I back away with them. She’s tugging on her bottom lip, staring up at me with heated eyes. “Come back during lunch,” she whispers. “Will an hour be sufficient, Mr. Nash?”\n\nI wink at her. “I guess it’ll have to do,” I say as I head out the door. I don’t pause until I’m down the hallway and around the corner, out of her line of sight.\n\nThe eighteen-year-old irresponsible side of me wants to high five myself for having apparently snagged the school counselor, but the reasonable side of me wants to punch myself for doing something like that to Charlie.\n\nCharlie is obviously the better choice, and I hate knowing that I was putting that relationship at risk.\n\nBut then again, so was Charlie.\n\nLuckily, the schedules list our locker numbers and combinations. Hers is 543 and mine is 544. I’m guessing that was intentional.\n\nI open my locker first, and find three textbooks stacked inside. There’s a half empty coffee in front of the books and an empty Cinnamon roll wrapper. There are two pictures taped to the inside of the locker: one of Charlie and me, the other just of Charlie.\n\nI pull the picture of her down and stare at it. Why, if we weren’t happy together, do I have pictures of her in my locker? Especially this one. I obviously took it, as it’s similar in style to the pictures hanging around my room.\n\nShe’s sitting cross-legged on a couch. Her head is tilted slightly and she’s staring directly at the camera.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

She’s both confident and comfortable, and although she isn’t smiling or laughing in the photo, I can tell she’s happy. Whenever this was taken, it was a good day for her. For us. Her eyes are screaming a thousand things in this photo, but the loudest is, “I love you, Silas!”\n\nI stare at it a while longer and then place the photo back inside the locker. I check my phone to see if she’s texted. She hasn’t. I look around, just as Landon approaches from down the hall. He tosses words over his shoulder as he passes me. “Looks like Brian isn’t quite out of the picture yet, brother.”\n\nThe bell rings.\n\nI look in the direction Landon came from and see a heavier crowd of students at that end of the hallway. People seem to be stalling, glancing over their shoulders. Some are looking at me, some are fixated on whatever is at the end of the hallway. I begin to walk in that direction and everyone’s attention falls on me as I pass.\n\nA break in the crowd begins to shape and that’s when I see her. She’s standing against a row of lockers, hugging herself with her arms. Brian is leaning against one of the lockers, looking at her intently. He looks deep in conversation, whereas she just appears guarded. He spots me almost immediately and his posture stiffens along with his expression. Charlie follows his gaze until her eyes land on mine.\n\nAs much as I can assume she doesn’t need rescuing, relief falls over her as soon as we lock eyes. A smile tugs at her lips, and I want nothing more than to get him away from her. I spend two seconds deliberating. Should I threaten him? Should I hit him like I wanted so badly to hit him yesterday in the parking lot? Neither of these actions feels as though they’ll make the point I want to make.\n\n“You should get to class,” I hear her say to him. Her words are quick, a warning, as if she’s afraid I’ve decided to punch him. She doesn’t have to worry. What I’m about to do will hurt Brian Finley a hell of a lot more than if I were to just hit him.\n\nThe second bell rings. No one moves. There are no students rushing to class to avoid being late. No one around me shuffles down the hall at the sound of the bell.\n\nThey’re all waiting. Watching. Expecting me to start a fight. I wonder if that’s what the old Silas would do? I wonder if that’s what the new Silas should do?\n\nI ignore everyone but Charlie and walk confidently toward her, keeping my eyes trained on her the entire time. As soon as Brian sees me approaching, he takes two steps away from her. I look directly at him while I stretch out my hand toward her, giving her the choice to take it and go with me or remain where she is.\n\nI feel her fingers slide between mine and she grips my hand tightly. I pull her away from the lockers, away from Brian, away from the crowd of students. As soon as we round the corner, she drops my hand and stops walking.\n\n“That was a little dramatic, don’t you think?” she says.\n\nI turn to face her. Her eyes are narrowed, but her mouth could pass for smiling. I can’t tell if she’s amused or angry.\n\n“They expected a certain reaction from me. What’d you want me to do, tap him on the shoulder and ask politely if I could cut in?”\n\nShe folds her arms over her chest. “What makes you think I needed you to do anything?”\n\nI don’t understand her hostility. It seemed like we left on good terms last night, so I’m confused as to why she seems so angry with me.\n\nShe rubs her hands up and down her arms and then her eyes fall to the floor. “Sorry,” she mutters. “I just…” She looks up at the ceiling and groans. “I was just prodding him for information. That’s the only reason I was with him in the hallway just now. I wasn’t flirting.”\n\nHer response catches me off guard. I don’t like the look of guilt in her expression. That’s not why I pulled her away from him, but I realize now that she thinks I really am upset with her for being with him. I could tell she didn’t want to be there, but maybe she doesn’t realize how well I’ve learned to read her.\n\nI take a step toward her. When she lifts her eyes to meet mine, I smile. “Would it make you feel better to know I was cheating on you with the guidance counselor?”\n\nShe sucks in a quick rush of air and shock registers on her face.\n\n“You weren’t the only one who wasn’t committed to us, Charlie. Apparently we both had issues we needed to work out, so don’t be so hard on yourself.”\n\nRelief probably isn’t the reaction a girl should have to finding out her boyfriend has been cheating on her, but it’s definitely what Charlie feels right now. I can see it in her eyes and I can hear it in the pent up breath she releases.\n\n“Wow…,” she says, her hands falling to her hips. “So technically, we’re tied?”\n\nTied? I shake my head. “This isn’t a game I want to win, Charlie. If anything, I’d say we both lost.”\n\nHer lips spread into a ghostly grin, and then she looks over her shoulder. “We should figure out where our classes are.”\n\nI remember the schedules and pull hers out of my back pocket. “We’re not together until fourth period History. You have English first. It’s back in the other hallway,” I say, motioning toward her first period classroom.\n\nShe nods appreciatively and unfolds the schedule. “Smart thinking,” she says, glancing it over. She looks back up at me with a wicked smile. “I guess you got these from your guidance counselor mistress?”\n\nHer words make me wince, even though I shouldn’t really feel remorse for whatever happened before yesterday.\n\n“Ex-guidance counselor mistress,” I clarify with a grin. She laughs, and it’s a laugh of solidarity. As screwed up as our situation is, and as confusing as the new information about our relationship is, the fact that we can laugh about it proves that we at least share in the absurdity of it all. And the only thought I have as I walk away from her is how much I wish Brian Finley could choke on her laugh.\n\nThe first three classes of the day felt foreign. No one in them and nothing discussed seemed familiar to me. I felt like an imposter, out of place.\n\nBut the instant I walked into fourth period and took a seat next to Charlie, my mood changed. She’s familiar. My only familiar thing in a world of inconsistency and confusion.\n\nWe stole a few glances at each other, but we never spoke during class. We aren’t even speaking now as we enter the cafeteria together. I glance at our table and everyone from yesterday is already seated, save our two empty seats.\n\nI nudge my head toward the lunch line. “Let’s get our food first.”\n\nShe glances up at me, briefly, before looking back at the table. “I’m not really hungry,” she says. “I’ll just wait for you at the table.” She heads in the direction of our group and I head toward the cafeteria line.\n\nAfter grabbing my tray and a Pepsi, I walk over to the table and take a seat. Charlie is looking down at her phone, excluding herself from the surrounding conversation.\n\nThe guy to my right—Andrew, I think—elbows me. “Silas,” he says, jabbing me repeatedly. “Tell him how much I benched Monday.”\n\nI look up at the guy sitting across from us. He rolls his eyes and downs the rest of his soda before slamming it on the table. “Come on, Andrew. You think I’m stupid enough to believe your best friend wouldn’t lie for you?”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

I open my soda and take a sip, just as Charlie clenches her waist. It’s loud in the cafeteria, but I still hear the rumble of her stomach. She’s hungry.\n\nIf she’s hungry, why isn’t she eating?\n\n“Charlie?” I lean in close to her. “Why aren’t you eating?” She dismisses my question with a shrug. I lower my voice even more. “Do you have money?”\n\nHer eyes dart up to mine as if I just revealed a huge secret to the entire room. She swallows and then looks away, embarrassed. “No,” she says quietly. “I gave my last few dollars to Janette this morning. I’ll be fine until I get home.”\n\nI set my drink down on the table and push my tray in front of her. “Here. I’ll go get another one.”\n\nI stand and go back to the line and get another tray. When I return to the table, she’s taken a few bites of the food. She doesn’t tell me thank you, and I feel relieved. Making sure she has food to eat isn’t a favor I want to be thanked for. It’s something I hope she would expect from me.\n\n“Do you want a ride home today?” I ask her, just as we’re finishing up our meal.\n\n“Dude, you can’t miss practice again,” Andrew shoots in my direction. “Coach won’t let you play tomorrow night if you do.”\n\nI rub a palm down my face, and then I reach in my pocket and retrieve my keys. “Here,” I tell her, placing them in her hand. “Drive your sister home after school. Pick me up when practice is over.”\n\nShe tries to hand the keys back to me, but I won’t take them. “Keep them,” I tell her. “You might need a car today and I won’t be using it.”\n\nAndrew interrupts. “You’re letting her drive your car? Are you kidding me? You’ve never even let me sit behind the damn wheel!”\n\nI look over at Andrew and shrug. “You aren’t the one I’m in love with.”\n\nCharlie spits out her drink with a burst of laughter. I glance over at her, and her smile is huge. It lights up her entire face, somehow even making the brown of her eyes seem less dark. I may not remember anything about her, but I would bet her smile was my favorite part of her.\n\nThis day has been exhausting. It feels like I’ve been on a stage for hours, acting out scenes I have no script for. The only thing that appeals to me right now is either being in my bed or being with Charlie. Or maybe a combination of both.\n\nHowever, Charlie and I both still have a goal, and that’s to figure out what the hell happened to us yesterday. Despite the fact that neither of us really wanted to bother with school today, we knew school could lead to an answer. After all, this did happen in the middle of the school day yesterday, so the answer could be related somehow.\n\nFootball practice may be of some help. I’ll be around people I haven’t spent much time with in the last twenty-four hours. I might learn something about myself or about Charlie that I didn’t know before. Something that could shed some light on our situation.\n\nI’m relieved to find all the lockers have names on them, so it isn’t hard to locate my gear. What is hard is trying to figure out how to put it on. I struggle with the pants, all the while trying to look like I know what I’m doing. The locker room slowly empties out as all the guys make their way to the field until I’m the only one left.\n\nWhen I think I’ve got everything situated, I grab my jersey off the top shelf of the locker to pull it on over my head. A box catches my eye, located in the back of the top shelf of my locker. I pull it toward me and take a seat on the bench. It’s a red box, much larger than a box that would just contain a piece of jewelry. I pull the lid off and find a few pictures at the very top.\n\nThere aren’t any people in the pictures. They seem to be of places. I flip through them and come to a picture of a swing set. It’s raining, and the ground beneath the swing is covered in water. I flip it over, and written on the back, it says, Our first kiss.\n\nThe next picture is of a backseat, but the view is from the floorboard, looking up. I flip it over. Our first fight.\n\nThird is a picture of what looks like a church, but it’s only the picture of the doors. Where we met.\n\nI flip through all the pictures until finally I get to a letter, folded at the bottom of the box. I pick it up and unfold it. It’s a short letter in my handwriting, addressed to Charlie. I begin to read it, but my phone buzzes, so I reach over and unlock it.\n\nCharlie: What time is your practice over?\n\nMe: Not sure. I found a box of stuff in the locker room. Don’t know if it’ll help, but there’s a letter in it.\n\nCharlie: What does it say?\n\n“Silas!” someone yells from behind me. I spin around and drop two of the pictures in my hands. There’s a man standing at the door with an angry look on his face. “Get on the field!”\n\nI nod and he continues on down the hall. I put the pictures back in the box and set it back inside my locker. I take a deep, calming breath and make my way out to the practice field.\n\nTwo lines are formed on the field, both rows of guys hunched forward and staring at the guy in front of them. There’s an obvious opening, so I jog toward the empty spot and copy what the other players are doing.\n\n“For shit’s sake, Nash! Why are you not wearing your shoulder pads?” Someone yells.\n\nShoulder pads. Crap.\n\nI skip out of line and run back to the locker room. This is going to be the longest hour of my life. It’s odd I can’t remember the rules of football. Can’t be that hard, though. Just run back and forth a few times and practice will be over.\n\nI locate pads behind the row of lockers. Luckily, they’re easy to put on. I rush back out onto the field and everyone is scattering, running around like ants. I hesitate before walking onto the field. When a whistle blows, someone shoves me from behind. “Go!” he yells, frustrated.\n\nThe lines, the numbers, the goal posts. They mean nothing to me as I stand on the field amongst the other guys. One of the coaches shouts an order and before I know it, the ball is being thrown in my direction. I catch it.\n\nWhat now?\n\nRun. I should probably run.\n\nI make it three feet before my face meets the astroturf. A whistle blows. A man yells.\n\nI stand up, just as one of the coaches stalks in my direction. “What the hell was that? Get your damn head in the play!”\n\nI look around me, the sweat beginning to trickle down my forehead. Landon’s voice rings out behind me. “Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?”\n\nI turn and look at him, just as everyone huddles around me. I follow their motions and lay my arms over the backs of the guys to my left and right. No one speaks for several seconds, and then I realize they’re all looking at me. Waiting. I think they want me to say something? I get the feeling it’s not a prayer circle.\n\n“You gonna call a play or what?” The guy to my left says.\n\n“Uh…,” I stutter. “You…,” I point to Landon. “Do that…thing.” Before they can question me, I pull apart and the huddle breaks.\n\n“Coach is gonna bench him,” I hear someone mumble behind me. A whistle blows and before the sound even leaves my ears, a freight train crashes into my chest.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

He grabs my helmet and shakes it. “What the hell is wrong with you?” He looks around and then back down at me. His eyes narrow. “Stay on the ground. Act sick.”\n\nI do what he says and he jumps up to a stand. “I told him not to come to practice, Coach,” Landon says. “He’s had strep all week. I think he’s dehydrated.”\n\nI close my eyes, relieved for my brother. I kind of like this kid.\n\n“What the hell are you even doing here, Nash?” The coach is kneeling now. “Go to the locker room and get hydrated. We’ve got a game tomorrow night.” He stands and motions for one of the assistant coaches. “Get him a Z-pack and make sure he’s ready for the field tomorrow.”\n\nLandon pulls me up. My ears are still ringing, but I’m able to breathe now. I make my way toward the locker rooms, relieved to be off the field. I should have never walked on in the first place. Not smart, Silas.\n\nI make it back to the locker room and change out of my gear. As soon as I get my shoes on, I hear footsteps nearing the locker room from down the hall. I glance around and spot an exit on the far wall, so I rush to it and push it open. Luckily, it leads right out to the parking lot.\n\nI’m immediately relieved to see my car. I rush over to it just as Charlie climbs out of the driver side, hopping onto her feet as I approach. I’m so relieved to see her—to just have someone to relate to—that I don’t even think about what I do next.\n\nI grab her wrist and pull her to me, wrapping my arms around her in a tight hug. My face is buried in her hair and I let out a sigh. She feels familiar. Safe. Makes me forget that I can’t even remember…\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\nShe’s stiff against me. Her cold reaction reminds me that we don’t do things like this. Silas and Charlie did things like this.\n\nShit.\n\nI clear my throat and release her, taking a quick step back. “Sorry,” I mutter. “Force of habit.”\n\n“We have no habits.” She pushes past me and walks around my car.\n\n“Do you think you’ve always been this mean to me?” I ask her.\n\nShe looks at me from over the hood and nods. “My money’s on yes. You’re probably a glutton for punishment.”\n\n“More like a masochist,” I mutter.\n\nWe both climb into my car, and I have two places I plan on going tonight. The first being my house to shower, but I’m sure if I asked her if she wanted to come along, she’d say no just to spite me. Instead, I head in the direction of my house and don’t give her a choice.\n\n“Why are you smiling?” she asks, three miles into our drive.\n\nI didn’t realize I was. I shrug. “Just thinking.”\n\n“About what?”\n\nI glance at her and she’s waiting for my answer with an impatient frown.\n\n“I was wondering how the old Silas ever broke through your hard exterior.”\n\nShe laughs. “What makes you think he did?”\n\nI would smile again, but I don’t think I’ve stopped. “You saw the video, Charlie. You loved him.” I pause for a second, then rephrase. “Me. You loved me.”\n\n“She loved you,” Charlie says, and then smiles. “I’m not even sure if I like you yet.”\n\nI shake my head with a soft laugh. “I don’t know myself very well, but I must have been extremely competitive. Because I just took that as a challenge.”\n\n“Took what as a challenge? You think you can make me like you again?”\n\nI look over at her and give my head the slightest shake. “No. I’m gonna make you fall in love with me again.”\n\nI can see the gentle roll of her throat as she swallows, but just as fast as she let her guard down, it flies back up. “Good luck with that,” she says, facing forward again. “I’m pretty sure you’ll be the first guy to ever compete with himself over the affection of a girl.”\n\n“Maybe so,” I say as we pull into my driveway. “But my money’s on me.”\n\nI turn the car off and get out. She doesn’t unbuckle. “You coming? I need to take a quick shower.”\n\nShe doesn’t even look at me. “I’ll wait in the car.”\n\nI don’t argue. I close the door and head inside to shower, thinking about the small smile I could swear was playing in the corner of her mouth.\n\nAnd while winning her over again isn’t my main priority, it’s definitely the new back-up plan in case neither of us can figure out how to revert back to who we were before yesterday. Because even through all the bullshit—her cheating on me with Brian, me cheating on her with the counselor, our families in turmoil—we still obviously tried to make it work. There had to be something there, something deeper than attraction or a simple childhood bond, that made me fight to keep her.\n\nI want to feel that again. I want to remember what it feels like to love someone like that. And not just anyone. I want to know what it feels like to love Charlie.\n\nI’m standing on the edge of the lawn, looking down his street when he walks up behind me. I don’t hear him approach, but I smell him. I don’t know how, since he smells just like the outdoors.\n\n“What are you looking at?” he asks.\n\nI stare at the houses, each of them immaculate and manicured to the point of irritation. It makes me want to shoot a gun into the air, just to see all the quiet people inside scramble out. This neighborhood needs a little life breathed into it. “It’s strange how money seems to silence a neighborhood,” I say quietly. “On my street, where no one has money, it’s so loud. Sirens blaring, people shouting, car doors slamming, stereos thumping. There’s always someone, somewhere, making noise.” I turn and look up at him, not expecting the reaction I have to seeing his damp hair and smooth jaw. I focus on his eyes, but that isn’t much better. I clear my throat and look away. “I think I prefer the noise.”\n\nHe takes a step until we’re shoulder to shoulder, both staring at the taciturn street. “No you don’t. You don’t prefer either.” He says this like he knows me and I want to remind him he doesn’t know me at all, but he puts his hand on my elbow. “Let’s get out of here,” he says. “Go do something that doesn’t belong to Charlie and Silas. Something that’s ours.”\n\n“You’re talking about us like we’re body invaders.”\n\nSilas closes his eyes and tilts his head back. “You have no idea how many times a day I think about invading your body.”\n\nI don’t intend to laugh as hard as I do, but I trip over my own feet and Silas reaches down to catch me. We’re both laughing as he rights me on my feet and rubs his hands up and down my arms.\n\nI look away. I’m tired of liking him. I only have a day and a half worth of memories, but they’re all filled with me not hating Silas. And now he’s made it his personal mission to make me love him again. It’s annoying that I like it.\n\n“Go away,” I say.\n\nHe raises his hands in surrender and takes a step back. “This far?”\n\n“Farther.”\n\nAnother step. “Better?”\n\n“Yes,” I smart.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\n7 phút mỗi ngày!

You just go on and on and everyone ends up cheating just to be over with it.”\n\nHe’s quiet for a minute. I feel bad for saying something so awkward even if it was a joke.\n\n“You’re probably right,” he laughs. “That’s why you cheated on me with that asshat, Brian. Lucky for you, I’m not Monopoly Silas anymore. I’m Tetris Silas. All my pieces and parts are going to fit into all of your pieces and parts.”\n\nI snort. “And the guidance counselor’s, apparently.”\n\n“Low blow, Charlie,” he says, shaking his head.\n\nI wait a few seconds, chewing on my lip. Then I say, “I don’t think I want you to call me that.”\n\nSilas turns to look at me. “Charlie?”\n\n“Yeah,” I look over at him. “Is that weird? I don’t feel like I’m her. I don’t even know her. It just doesn’t feel like my name.”\n\nHe nods as we walk toward his car. “So, I get to rename you?”\n\n“Until we figure all this out…yeah.”\n\n“Poppy,” he says.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Lucy.”\n\n“Hell no, what’s wrong with you?”\n\nHe opens the passenger side door to his Rover and I climb in.\n\n“Okay…okay. I can see you don’t like traditionally cute names. We can try for something tougher.” He walks around to the driver side and climbs in. “Xena…”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Rogue.”\n\n“Ugh. No.”\n\nWe go back and forth like this until Silas’s GPS tells us that we’ve arrived. I look around, surprised that I was too engaged with him to notice the drive here. When I look down at my phone I see that Brian has texted me six times. I don’t want to deal with him right now. I shove my phone and wallet under the seat, out of view.\n\n“Where are we?”\n\n“Bourbon Street,” he says. “Most happening place in New Orleans.”\n\n“How do you know that?” I ask suspiciously.\n\n“I Googled it.” We stare at each other over the hood, and then both shut our doors at the same time.\n\n“How did you know what Google was?”\n\n“I thought that’s what we’re supposed to be figuring out together.” We meet at the front of the car.\n\n“I think we’re aliens,” I say. “That’s why we don’t have any of Charlie and Silas’s memories. But we remember things like Google and Tetris because of the computer chips in our brains.”\n\n“So, can I rename you Alien?”\n\nBefore I can think about what I’m doing, I send the back of my hand into his chest. “Focus, Silas!”\n\nHe uumphs, and then I’m pointing straight ahead. “What’s that?” I walk ahead of him.\n\nIt’s a building, castle-like in structure, and white. There are three spires jutting up toward the sky.\n\n“Looks like a church,” he says, taking out his phone.\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n“Taking a picture…in case we forget again. I figure we should document what’s happening and where we go.”\n\nI’m quiet as I think about what he said. It’s a really good idea. “That’s where we should go, right? Churches help people…,” my voice trails off.\n\n“Yes,” says Silas. “They help people, not aliens. And since we’re—”\n\nI hit him again. I wish he would take this seriously. “What if we’re angels and we’re supposed to help someone, and we were given these bodies to fulfill our mission?”\n\nHe sighs. “Are you listening to yourself?”\n\nWe’ve reached the doors to the church, which are ironically locked. “Okay,” I say, spinning around. “What’s your suggestion for what’s happened to us? Did we boink our heads together and lose our memories? Or maybe we ate something that really messed us up!”I storm down the stairs.\n\n“Hey! Hey!” he calls. “You’re not allowed to get mad at me. This is not my fault.” He runs down the stairs after me.\n\n“How do we know that? We don’t know anything, Silas! This could be all your fault!”\n\nWe’re standing at the bottom of the stairs now, staring at each other. “Maybe it is,” he says. “But whatever I did, you did it too. Because in case you haven’t noticed, we’re in the same boat.”\n\nI clench and unclench my fists, take deep breaths, concentrate on staring at the church until my eyes water.\n\n“Look,” Silas says, stepping closer. “I’m sorry for turning this into a joke. I want to figure it out as much as you do. What are some of your other ideas?”\n\nI close my eyes. “Fairy tales,” I say, looking back up at him. “Someone is always cursed. To break the spell they have to figure something out about themselves…then…”\n\n“Then what?”\n\nI can tell he’s trying to take me seriously, but this somehow makes me angrier. “There’s a kiss...”\n\nHe grins. “A kiss, huh? I’ve never kissed anyone before.”\n\n“Silas!”\n\n“What? If I can’t remember, it doesn’t count!”\n\nI fold my arms across my chest and watch a street musician pick up his violin. He remembers the first time he picked up a violin, the first notes he played, who gave it to him. I envy his memories.\n\n“I’ll be serious, Charlie. I’m sorry.”\n\nI look at Silas out of the corner of my eye. He looks genuinely sorry—hands shoved into his pockets, neck dropping like it’s suddenly too heavy.\n\n“So, what do you think we need to do? Kiss?”\n\nI shrug. “It’s worth a try, right?”\n\n“You said in fairy tales they have to figure something out first…”\n\n“Yeah. Like, Sleeping Beauty needed someone brave to kiss her and wake her from the sleeping curse. Snow White needed true love’s kiss to bring her back to life. Ariel needed to get Eric to kiss her to break the spell the sea witch put on her.”\n\nHe perks up. “Those are movies,” he says. “Do you remember watching them?”\n\n“I don’t remember watching them, I just know I’ve seen them. Mr. Deetson spoke about fairy tales in English today. That’s where I got the idea.”\n\nWe start walking toward the street musician who is playing something slow and mournful.\n\n“Sounds like the breaking of the curse is mostly up to the guy,” Silas says. “He needs to mean something to her.”\n\n“Yeah…” My voice drops off as we stop to listen. I wish I knew the song he was playing. It sounds like something I’ve heard, but I have no name for it.\n\n“There’s a girl,” I say softly. “I want to talk to her…I think maybe she knows something. A few people have referred to her as The Shrimp.”\n\nSilas’s eyebrows draw together. “What do you mean? Who is she?”\n\n“I don’t know. She’s in a couple of my classes. It’s just a feeling.”\n\nWe stand among a group of onlookers, and Silas reaches for my hand. For the first time, I don’t pull away from him. I let his warm fingers intertwine with mine. With his free hand, he takes a picture of the violinist, then he looks down at me. “So I can remember the first time I held your hand.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\n7 phút mỗi ngày!

I don’t know if it’s because she likes holding it, or if it’s because Bourbon Street is…well...\n\n“Oh, God,” she says, turning toward me. She fists my shirt in her hand and presses her forehead against my arm. “That guy just flashed me,” she says, laughing into the sleeve of my shirt. “Silas, I just saw my first penis!”\n\nI laugh as I continue steering her through the inebriated crowd of Bourbon Street. After walking a ways, she peeks up again. We’re now approaching an even larger group of belligerent men, all without shirts. In the place of shirts are mounds of beads draped around their necks. They’re all laughing and screaming at the people perched on the balconies above us. She squeezes my hand tighter until we’ve successfully navigated through them. She relaxes and puts more space between us.\n\n“What’s with the beads?” she asks. “Why would anyone spend money on such tacky jewelry?”\n\n“It’s part of the Mardi Gras tradition,” I tell her. “I read about it when I was researching Bourbon Street. It started as a celebration for the last Tuesday before Lent, but I guess it’s turned into a year-round thing.” I pull her against my side and point down to the sidewalk in front of her. She sidesteps around what looks like puke.\n\n“I’m hungry,” she says.\n\nI laugh. “Stepping over vomit made you hungry?”\n\n“No, vomit made me think of food and food made my stomach growl. Feed me.” She points to a restaurant up the street. The sign is flashing in red neon. “Let’s go there.”\n\nShe steps ahead of me, still gripping my hand. I glance down at my phone and follow her lead. I have three missed calls. One from “Coach,” one from my brother, and one from “Mom.”\n\nIt’s the first time I’ve thought about my mother. I wonder what she’s like. I wonder why I haven’t met her yet.\n\nMy whole body crashes into the back of Charlie’s after she stops short to let a vehicle pass. Her hand flies up to the back of her head where my chin smashed against it. “Ouch,” she says, rubbing her head.\n\nI rub my chin and watch from behind her as she pushes her hair forward, over her shoulder. My eyes fall to the tip of what appears to be a tattoo peeking out from the back of her shirt.\n\nShe begins walking again, but I grab her shoulder. “Wait,” I tell her. My fingers trail to the collar of her shirt and I pull it down a couple of inches. Right below the nape of her neck is a small silhouette of trees in black ink. I run my fingers over their outline. “You have a tattoo.”\n\nHer hand flies to the spot I’m touching. “What?!” she shrieks. She spins around and looks up at me. “I do not.”\n\n“You do.” I turn her back around and pull the shirt down again. “Here,” I say as I trace the trees again. This time I notice as chills break out on her neck. I follow the line of tiny bumps with my eyes, running over her shoulder and hiding beneath her shirt. I look back at the tattoo again, because her fingers are now attempting to feel what I’m feeling. I take two of them and press them against her skin. “A silhouette of trees,” I tell her. “Right here.”\n\n“Trees?” she says, cocking her head to the side. “Why would I have trees?” She turns around. “I want to see it. Take a picture with your phone.”\n\nI pull her shirt down enough so that she can see the entire tattoo, even though it’s no more than three inches wide. I brush her hair over her shoulder again, not for the sake of the picture, but because I’ve really been wanting to do that. I also reposition her hand so that it’s coming across the front of her body, draping over her shoulder.\n\n“Silas,” she grumbles. “Just take the damn picture. This isn’t art class.”\n\nI grin and wonder if I’m always like this—if I refuse to take a simple picture, knowing it only takes a little bit more effort to make it exceptional. I bring the phone up and snap the picture, then look at the screen, admiring how good the tattoo looks on her. She spins around and takes the phone from my hands.\n\nShe looks down at the picture and gasps. “Oh my God.”\n\n“It’s a very nice tattoo,” I tell her. She hands me back my phone and rolls her eyes, walking again in the direction of the restaurant.\n\nShe can roll her eyes all she wants. It doesn’t change how she reacted to my fingers trailing across the back of her neck.\n\nI watch her walk toward the restaurant, and realize that I have her figured out already. The more she likes me, the more closed off she becomes. The more sarcasm she inflicts on me. Vulnerability makes her feel weak, so she’s pretending to be tougher than she really is. I think the old Silas knew this about her, too. Which is why he loved her, because apparently he liked the game they played.\n\nApparently I do too, because once again, I’m following her.\n\nWe walk through the door of the restaurant and Charlie says, “Two people, booth please,” before the hostess even has a chance to ask. At least she said please.\n\n“Right this way,” the woman says.\n\nThe restaurant is quiet and dark, a stark contrast to the noise and neon lights of Bourbon Street. We both breathe a collective sigh of relief once we’re seated. The waitress hands us our menus and takes our drink order. Every now and then, Charlie lifts a hand to the back of her neck as if she can feel the outline of the tattoo.\n\n“What do you think it means?” she says, still staring at the menu in front of her.\n\nI shrug. “I don’t know. Maybe you liked forests?” I glance up at her. “These fairy tales you talked about. Did they all take place in forests? Maybe the man who needs to break your spell with a kiss is a strapping lumberjack, living in the woods.”\n\nHer eyes meet mine and I can tell my jokes are aggravating her. Or maybe she’s aggravated because she thinks I’m funny. “Stop making fun of me,” she says. “We woke up without our memories at the exact same time, Silas. Nothing is more absurd than that. Even fairy tales with lumberjacks.”\n\nI smile innocently and look down at my hand. “I have callouses,” I tell her, lifting my hand and pointing at the rough skin of my palm. “I could be your lumberjack.”\n\nShe rolls her eyes again, but laughs this time. “You probably have callouses from jerking off too much.”\n\nI hold up my right hand. “But they’re on both hands, not just my left.”\n\n“Ambidextrous,” she deadpans.\n\nWe both grin as our drinks are placed in front of us. “Ready to order?” the waitress asks.\n\nCharlie quickly scans the menu and says, “I hate that we can’t remember what we like.” She looks up at the waitress. “I’ll take a grilled cheese,” she says. “It’s safe.”\n\n“Burger and fries, no mayo,” I tell her. We hand her back our menus and I refocus on Charlie. “You aren’t eighteen yet. How could you get a tattoo?”\n\n“Bourbon Street doesn’t seem to be a stickler for the rules,” she says. “I probably have a fake ID hidden somewhere.”\n\nI open the search engine on my phone. “I’ll try to figure out what it means. I’ve gotten pretty good at this Google thing.” I spend the next few minutes searching every possible meaning of trees and forests and clusters of trees. Just when I think I’m on to something, she pulls my phone away and sets it on the table.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nMen gan cao chính là vì đã mắc virus viêm gan B!

What the…\n\n“Come on,” she says over her shoulder.\n\nI follow her to the hallway that leads to the restrooms. She pushes open the women’s and peeks inside, then pulls her head out. “It’s a single stall. It’s empty,” she says, holding the door open for me.\n\nI pause and look at the men’s restroom, which looks perfectly fine, so I don’t know why she’s—\n\n“Silas!” She grabs my arm and pulls me inside the restroom. Once we’re inside, I half expect her to wrap her arms around my neck and kiss me because…why else would we be in here together?\n\n“Take off your shirt.”\n\nI look down at my shirt.\n\nI look back up at her. “Are we…are we about to make out? Because I didn’t picture it going down like this.”\n\nShe groans and reaches forward, pulling at the hem of my shirt. I help her pull it over my head when she says, “I want to see if you have any tattoos, dumbass.”\n\nI deflate.\n\nI feel like an eighteen-year-old who’s just been blue-balled. I guess I kind of am…\n\nShe turns me around and, when I face the mirror, she gasps. Her eyes are fixated on my back. My muscles tense beneath her touch as her fingertips meet my right shoulder blade. She traces a circle, spanning a radius of several inches. I squeeze my eyes shut and try to control my pulse. I suddenly feel drunker than everyone on Bourbon Street combined. I’m gripping the counter in front of me because her fingers…my skin.\n\n“Jesus,” I groan, dropping my head between my shoulders. Focus, Silas.\n\n“What’s wrong?” she asks, pausing her inspection of my tattoo. “It doesn’t hurt does it?”\n\nI release a laugh, because her hands on me are the opposite of pain. “No, Charlie. It doesn’t hurt.”\n\nMy eyes meet hers in the mirror and she stares at me for several seconds. When what she’s doing to me finally registers, she glances away and pulls her hand from my back. Her cheeks flush.\n\n“Put your shirt on and go wait for our food,” she demands. “I have to pee.”\n\nI release my grip on the counter and inhale deeply as I pull my shirt back over my head. On my walk back to our table, I realize I never even asked her what the tattoo was.\n\n“A strand of pearls,” she says as she slides into the booth. “Black pearls. It’s about six inches in diameter.”\n\n“Pearls?”\n\nShe nods.\n\n“Like a…necklace?”\n\nShe nods again and takes a sip of her drink. “You have a tattoo of a woman’s necklace on your back, Silas.” She’s smiling now. “Very lumberjack-esque.”\n\nShe’s enjoying this. “Yeah, well. You have trees on your back. Not much to brag about. You’ll probably get termites.”\n\nShe laughs out loud and it makes me laugh, too. She moves the straw around in her drink and looks down at her glass. “Knowing me…,” she pauses. “Knowing Charlie, she wouldn’t have gotten a tattoo unless it really meant something to her. It had to be something she knew she would never grow tired of. Never stop loving.”\n\nTwo familiar words stick out in her sentence. “Never never,” I whisper.\n\nShe looks up at me, recognizing the phrase we repeated to each other in the video. She tilts her head to the side. “You think it had something to do with you? With Silas?” She shakes her head, silently disagreeing with my suggestion, but I begin scrolling through my phone. “Charlie wouldn’t be that stupid,” she adds. “She wouldn’t ink something into her skin that was related to a guy. Besides, what would trees have to do with you?”\n\nI find exactly what I’m looking for and, as much as I’m trying to keep a straight face, I can’t stop the smile. I know it’s a smug smile and I probably should not be looking at her like this, but I can’t help it. I hand her the phone and she looks down at the screen and reads out loud.\n\n“From a Greek name meaning forests or woods.” She looks up at me. “So it’s the meaning of a name?”\n\nI nod. Still smug. “Scroll up.”\n\nShe scrolls up the screen with a swipe of her finger and her lips part with a gasp. “Derived from the Greek term—Silas.” Her mouth clamps shut and her jaw hardens. She hands me back the phone and closes her eyes. Her head moves slowly back and forth. “She got a tattoo of the meaning of your name?”\n\nAs expected, she’s pretending to be disappointed in herself.\n\nAs expected, I feel triumphant.\n\n“You got a tattoo,” I tell her, pointing my finger in her direction. “It’s on you. Your skin. My name.” I can’t stop with the stupid smile plastered across my face. She rolls her eyes again, just as our food is laid in front of us.\n\nI push mine aside and search the meaning for the name Charlie. I don’t pull anything up that could mean pearls. After a few minutes, she finally sighs and says, “Try Margaret. My middle name.”\n\nI search the name Margaret and read the results out loud.\n\n“Margaret, from the Greek term meaning pearl.”\n\nI set my phone down. I don’t know why it seems like I’ve just won a bet, but I feel victorious.\n\n“It’s a good thing you’re giving me a new name,” she says, matter of fact.\n\nA new name my ass.\n\nI pull my plate in front of me and pick up a french fry. I point it at her and wink. “We’re branded. You and me. We are so in love, Charlie. You feeling it yet? Do I make your heart go pitter patter?”\n\n“These aren’t our tattoos,” she says.\n\nI shake my head. “Branded,” I repeat. I raise my index finger as if I’m gesturing over her shoulder. “Right there. Permanently. Forever.”\n\n“God,” she groans. “Shut up and eat your damn burger.”\n\nI eat it. I eat the entire thing with a shit-eating grin.\n\n“What now?” I ask, leaning back in my seat. She’s barely touched her food and I’m pretty sure I just broke a record with how fast I ate mine.\n\nShe looks up at me and I can see by the trepidation in her expression that she already knows what she wants to do next, she just doesn’t want to bring it up.\n\n“What is it?”\n\nHer eyes narrow. “I don’t want you to make a smart-ass comment in response to what I’m about to suggest.”\n\n“No, Charlie,” I say immediately. “We aren’t eloping tonight. The tattoos are enough commitment for now.”\n\nShe doesn’t roll her eyes at my joke this time. She sighs, defeated, and leans back in her seat.\n\nI hate her reaction. I like it a whole lot more when she rolls her eyes at me.\n\nI reach across the table and cover her hand with mine, rubbing my thumb over hers. “I’m sorry,” I say. “Sarcasm just makes this whole thing feel a little less frightening.” I remove my hand from hers. “What did you want to say? I’m listening. Promise. Lumberjack’s honor.”\n\nShe laughs with a small roll of her eyes and I’m relieved. She glances up at me and shifts in her seat, then begins playing with her straw again. “We passed a few…tarot shops. I think maybe we should get a reading.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

I just nod and pull my wallet out of my pocket. I lay enough money on the table to cover our bill and then I stand up. “I agree,” I tell her, reaching out for her hand.\n\nI actually don’t agree, but I feel bad. These last two days have been exhausting and I know she’s tired. The least I can do is make this easier for her, despite knowing this hocus pocus bullshit isn’t going to enlighten us in any way.\n\nWe pass a few tarot shops during our search, but Charlie shakes her head each time I point one out. I’m not sure what she’s looking for, but I actually like walking the streets with her, so I’m not complaining. She’s holding my hand, and sometimes I put my arm around her and pull her against me when the paths become too narrow. I don’t know if she’s noticed, but I’ve been leading us through a lot of these narrow paths unnecessarily. Any time I see a big crowd, I aim for it. After all, she’s still my back-up plan.\n\nAfter about half an hour longer of walking, it looks like we’re reaching the end of the French quarter. The crowds are dwindling, giving me fewer excuses to pull her to me. Some of the shops we’re passing have already closed. We make it to St. Philip Street when she pauses in front of an art gallery window.\n\nI stand next to her and stare at the displays illuminated inside the building. There are plastic body parts suspended from the ceiling, and giant, metal sea life clinging to the walls. The main display, which is directly in front of us, just happens to be a small corpse—wearing a strand of pearls.\n\nShe taps her finger against the glass, pointing at the corpse. “Look,” she says. “It’s me.” She laughs and moves her attention to somewhere else inside the store.\n\nI’m not looking at the corpse anymore. I’m not looking inside the store anymore.\n\nI’m looking at her.\n\nThe lights from inside the gallery are illuminating her skin, giving her a glow that really does make her look like an angel. I want to run my hand across her back and feel for actual wings.\n\nHer eyes move from one object to another as she studies everything beyond the window. She’s looking at each piece with bewilderment. I make a mental note to bring her back here when they’re actually open. I can’t imagine what she’d look like actually being able to touch one of the pieces.\n\nShe stares into the window a few minutes longer and I continue to stare at her, only now I’ve taken two steps and I’m standing directly behind her. I want to see her tattoo again, now that I know what it means. I wrap my hand around her hair and brush it forward, over her shoulder. I half expect her to reach behind her and slap my hand away, but instead, she sucks in a quick rush of air and looks down at her feet.\n\nI smile, remembering what it felt like when she ran her fingers over my tattoo. I don’t know if I make her feel the same, but she’s standing still, allowing my fingers to slip inside the collar of her shirt again.\n\nI swallow what feels like three entire heartbeats. I wonder if she’s always had this effect on me.\n\nI pull her shirt down, revealing her tattoo. A pang shoots through my stomach, because I hate that we don’t have this memory. I want to remember the discussion we had when we decided to make such a permanent decision. I want to remember who brought the idea up first. I want to remember what she looked like as the needle pierced her skin for the first time. I want to remember how we felt when it was over.\n\nI run my thumb over the silhouette of trees while curving the rest of my hand over her shoulder—over skin covered in chills again. She tilts her head to the side and the tiniest of whimpers escapes her throat.\n\nI squeeze my eyes shut. “Charlie?” My voice is like sandpaper. I clear my throat to smooth it out. “I changed my mind,” I say quietly. “I don’t want to give you a new name. I kind of love your old one now.”\n\nI wait.\n\nI wait for her snarky response. For her laughter.\n\nI wait for her to push my hand away from the nape of her neck.\n\nI get no reaction from her. Nothing. Which means I get everything.\n\nI keep my hand on her back as I slowly step around her. I’m standing between her and the window now, but she keeps her eyes focused on the ground. She doesn’t look up at me, because I know she doesn’t like to feel weak. And right now, I’m making her weak. I bring my free hand to her chin and graze my fingers up her jaw, tilting her face to mine.\n\nWhen we lock eyes, I feel like I’m meeting a brand new side of her. A side of her without resolve. A vulnerable side. A side that’s allowing herself to feel something. I want to grin and ask her how it feels to be in love, but I know teasing her in this moment would piss her off and she’d walk away and I can’t let that happen. Not right now. Not when I finally get to catalog an actual memory with all the numerous fantasies I’ve had about her mouth.\n\nHer tongue slides across her bottom lip, causing jealousy to flutter through me, because I really wanted to be the one to do that to her lip.\n\nIn fact…I think I will.\n\nI begin to dip my head, just as she presses her hands against my forearms. “Look,” she says, pointing at the building next door. The flickering light has stolen her attention and I want to curse the universe for the simple fact that a light bulb just interfered with what was about to become my absolute favorite of very few memories.\n\nI follow her gaze to a sign that doesn’t look any different from all of the other Tarot signs we’ve passed. The only thing different about this one is it just completely ruined my moment. And dammit, it was a good moment. A great one. One I know Charlie was also feeling, and I don’t know how long it’ll take me to get back to that.\n\nShe’s walking in the direction of the shop now. I follow behind her like a lovesick puppy.\n\nThe building is unmarked and it makes me wonder what it was about the unreliable, asshole-lighting that drew her away from my mouth. The only words indicating this is even a store are the “No Cameras” signs plastered on every blackened window.\n\nCharlie puts her hands on the door and pushes it open. I follow her inside and we’re soon standing in what looks like the center of a touristy voodoo gift shop. There’s a man standing behind a register and a few people browsing the aisles.\n\nI try to take everything in as I follow Charlie through the store. She fingers everything, touching the stones, the bones, the jars of miniature voodoo dolls. We silently make our way down each aisle until we reach the back wall. Charlie stops short, grabs my hand and points at a picture on the wall. “That gate,” she says. “You took a picture of that gate. It’s the one hanging on my wall.”\n\n“Can I help you?”\n\nWe both spin around and a large—really large—man with gauged ears and a lip ring is staring down at us.\n\nI kind of want to apologize to him and leave as fast as we can, but Charlie has other plans. “Do you know what this gate is guarding? The one in the picture?” Charlie asks him, pointing over her shoulder. The man’s eyes lift to the picture frame. He shrugs.\n\n“Must be new,” he says. “I’ve never noticed it before.” He looks at me, arching an eyebrow adorned with multiple piercings. One being a small…bone? Is that a bone sticking through his eyebrow? “You two looking for anything in particular?”\n\nI shake my head and begin to respond, but my words are cut off by someone else’s.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nMen gan cao chính là vì đã mắc virus viêm gan B!

A woman steps out, and Charlie immediately sidles against me. I wrap my arm around her. I don’t know why she’s allowing this place to freak her out. She doesn’t seem like the type to believe in this sort of thing, but I’m not complaining. A frightened Charlie means a very lucky Silas.\n\n“This way,” the woman says, motioning for us to follow her. I start to object, but then remind myself that places like this…they’re all about theatrics. It’s Halloween 365 days a year. She’s just playing a part. She’s no different than Charlie and me, pretending to be two people we aren’t.\n\nCharlie glances up at me, silently asking for permission to follow her. I nod and we follow the woman through the curtain of—I touch one of the beads and take a closer look—plastic skulls. Nice touch.\n\nThe room is small and every wall is covered with thick, velvet black curtains. There are candles lit around the room, flickers of light licking the walls, the floor, us. The woman takes a seat at a small table in the center of the room for us to sit in the two chairs across from her. I keep Charlie’s hand wrapped tightly in mine as we both sit.\n\nThe woman begins to slowly shuffle a deck of tarot cards. “A joint reading, I assume?” she asks.\n\nWe both nod. She hands Charlie the deck and asks her to hold them. Charlie takes them from her and clasps her hands around them. The woman nudges her head toward me. “Both of you. Hold them.”\n\nI want to roll my eyes, but instead I reach my hand across Charlie and place it on the deck with her.\n\n“You need to want the same thing out of this reading. Multiple readings can sometimes overlap when there isn’t cohesiveness. It’s important your goal is the same.”\n\nCharlie nods. “They are. It is.”\n\nI hate the desperation in her voice, like we’re actually going to get an answer. Surely she doesn’t believe this.\n\nThe woman reaches across to take the cards from our hands. Her fingers brush mine and they’re ice cold. I pull my hand back and grab Charlie’s, moving it onto my lap.\n\nShe begins laying cards out on the table, one by one. They’re all facedown. When she’s finished, she asks me to pull a card from the deck. When I hand her the card, she sets it apart from the others. She points at it. “This card will give you your answer, but the other cards explain the path to your question.”\n\nShe puts her fingers on the card in the middle. “This position represents your current situation.” She flips it over.\n\n“Death?” Charlie whispers. Her hand tightens around mine.\n\nThe woman looks at Charlie and tilts her head. “It isn’t necessarily a bad thing,” she says. “The death card represents a major change. A reformation. The two of you have experienced a loss of sorts.”\n\nShe touches another card. “This position represents the immediate past.” She flips it over and before I look down at the card, I can see the woman’s eyes narrow. My eyes fall to the card. The Devil.\n\n“This indicates something or someone was enslaving you in the past. It could represent a number of things close to you. Parental influence. An unhealthy relationship.” Her eyes meet mine. “Inverted cards reflect a negative influence, and although it represents the past, it can also signify something you’re currently transitioning through.”\n\nHer fingers fall to another card. “This card represents your immediate future.” She slides the card toward her and flips it over. A quiet gasp falls from her mouth and I feel Charlie flinch. I glance down at her and she’s staring intently at the woman, waiting for an explanation. She looks terrified.\n\nI don’t know what kind of game this woman is playing, but it’s beginning to piss me off…\n\n“The Tower card?” Charlie says. “What does it mean?”\n\nThe woman flips the card back over as if it’s the worst card in the deck. She closes her eyes and blows out a long breath. Her eyes pop open again and she’s staring right at Charlie. “It means…destruction.”\n\nI roll my eyes and push back from the table. “Charlie, let’s get out of here.”\n\nCharlie looks at me pleadingly. “We’re almost finished,” she says.\n\nI relent and scoot back toward the table.\n\nThe woman flips over two more cards, explaining them to Charlie, but I don’t hear a single word she says. My eyes wander around the room as I try to remain patient and let her finish, but I feel like we’re wasting time.\n\nCharlie’s hand begins squeezing the life out of mine, so I return my attention to the reading. The woman’s eyes are closed tight and her lips are moving. She’s mumbling words I can’t decipher.\n\nCharlie scoots closer to me, and I instinctively wrap my arm around her. “Charlie,” I whisper, making her look up at me. “It’s theatrics. She gets paid to do this. Don’t be scared.”\n\nMy voice must have broken the woman out of her conveniently timed trance. She’s tapping the table, trying to get our attention as if she wasn’t off in la-la land for the last minute and a half.\n\nHer fingers fall to the card I pulled out of the deck. Her eyes meet mine, and then they move to Charlie’s. “This card,” she says slowly. “Is your outcome card. Combined with the other cards in the reading, this gives you the answer to why you are here.” She flips the card over.\n\nThe woman doesn’t move. Her eyes are locked on the card beneath her fingertips. The rooms grows eerily quiet, and as if on cue, one of the candles loses its flame. Another nice touch, I think.\n\nI look down at the outcome card. There aren’t any words on it. No title. No picture.\n\nThe card is blank.\n\nI can feel Charlie stiffen in my arms as she stares at the blank card on the table. I shove back from the table and pull Charlie up. “This is ridiculous,” I say loudly, accidentally knocking my chair over.\n\nI’m not pissed that the woman is trying to scare us. It’s her job. I’m pissed because she’s actually scaring Charlie, yet she’s keeping up this ridiculous façade.\n\nI take Charlie’s face in my hands and look her in the eyes. “She planted that card to scare you, Charlie. This is all bullshit.” I take both her hands and begin to turn her toward the exit.\n\n“There are no blank cards in my tarot deck,” the woman says.\n\nI pause in my tracks and turn around to face her. Not because of what she said, but because of the way she said it. She sounded scared.\n\nScared for us?\n\nI close my eyes and exhale. She’s an actress, Silas. Calm your shit.\n\nI push open the door and pull Charlie outside. I don’t stop walking until we’re around the building and on another street. When we’re away from the store and away from the damn flickering of the sign, I stop walking and pull her against me. She wraps her arms around my waist and buries her head against my chest.\n\n“Forget all of that,” I say, rubbing my hand in reassuring circles over her back. “Fortune-telling, tarot readings…it’s ridiculous, Charlie.”\n\nShe pulls her face from my shirt and looks up at me. “Yeah. Ridiculous like the both of us waking up at school with no memory of who we are?”\n\nI close my eyes and pull away from her. I run my hands through my hair, the frustration from the day catching up to me. I can make light of it all with my jokes. I can dismiss her theories—from tarot readings to fairy tales—simply because it doesn’t make sense to me. But she’s right. None of this makes sense. And the more we try to uncover the mystery, the more I feel like we’re wasting our damn time.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\n7 phút mỗi ngày!

He wants out of here. I can feel his edginess.\n\n“Maybe we should go back and ask her more detailed questions,” I suggest.\n\n“No way,” he says. “I’m not entertaining that again.” He starts to walk away, and I consider going back in there myself. I’m just about to take my first step toward the shop when the “Open” sign in the window turns off. The shop is in sudden darkness. I chew on the inside of my cheek. I could come back when Silas isn’t around. Maybe she’d talk to me more.\n\n“Charlie!” he calls.\n\nI run after him until we’re walking side by side again. We can see our breath as we walk. When did it get this cold? I rub my hands together.\n\n“I’m hungry,” I say.\n\n“You’re always hungry. I’ve never seen someone so small eat so much.”\n\nHe doesn’t offer to feed me this time, so I continue to walk beside him. “What just happened back there?” I ask. I’m trying to make a joke of it, but my stomach feels funny.\n\n“Someone tried to scare us. That’s it.”\n\nI look up at Silas. Mostly everything together except those shoulders, which are tense. “But what if she’s right? What if there weren’t any blank cards in her tarot deck?”\n\n“No,” he says. “Just no.”\n\nI bite my lip and sidestep a man dancing backward down the sidewalk.\n\n“I don’t understand how you can dismiss something so easily, considering our circumstances,” I say from between my teeth. “Don’t you think—”\n\n“Why don’t we talk about something else,” Silas says.\n\n“Right, like what we’re going to do next weekend? Or how about we talk about what we did last weekend? Or maybe we talk about…” I smack my hand against my forehead. “The Electric Crush Diner.” How could I forget about that?\n\n“What?” Silas asks. “What’s that?”\n\n“We were there. You and me, last weekend. I found a receipt in my jeans pocket.” Silas is watching me recount all of this with a look of mild annoyance on his face. “I took Janette there for dinner last night. A server recognized me.”\n\n“Hey!” he yells over my shoulder. “If you touch her with that I’ll break you in half!”\n\nI glance behind me and see a man pointing a foam finger at my butt. He backs off when he sees the look on Silas’s face.\n\n“Why didn’t you tell me that?” Silas says under his breath, directing his attention back to me. “That’s not like tarot readers, that’s something important.”\n\n“I really don’t know. I meant to…”\n\nHe grabs my hand, but this time it’s not for the pleasure of our palms pressing together. He drags me down the street with one hand while typing something into his phone with the other. I’m both impressed and mildly annoyed at being spoken to like that. We may have been something in our other life, but in this life I don’t even know his middle name.\n\n“It’s on North Rampart Street,” I say, helpfully.\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nHe’s pissed. I kind of like the emo-ness of it. We pass through a park with a fountain. Street vendors have set up their artwork along the fence; they stare at us as we pass by. Silas is taking one step to my three. I trot to keep up. We walk so far until my feet hurt and finally I yank my hand free of his.\n\nHe stops and turns around.\n\nI don’t know what to say, or what I’m mad at, so I place my hands on my hips and glare at him.\n\n“What’s wrong with you?” he says.\n\n“I don’t know!” I shout. “But you can’t just drag me around the city! I can’t walk as fast as you and my feet hurt.”\n\nThis feels familiar. Why does this feel familiar?\n\nHe looks away and I can see the muscles working in his jaw. He turns back to me and everything happens quickly. He takes two steps and scoops me off my feet. Then he resumes his pace with my bouncing ever so slightly in his arms. After my initial squeal, I settle down and clasp my arms around his neck. I like it up here where I can smell his cologne and touch his skin. I don’t recall seeing perfume among Charlie’s things, and I doubt I would have thought to put any on. What does that say about Silas? That in the midst of all of this, he thought to pick up a bottle and spray cologne on his neck before he left the house this morning. Was he always the type of person who cared about the little things—like smelling good?\n\nAs I think these thoughts, Silas stops to ask a woman who has fallen in the street if she’s all right. She’s drunk and sloppy. When she tries to stand up, she steps on the hem of her dress and falls back down. Silas sets me down on the sidewalk and goes to help her.\n\n“Are you bleeding? Did you hurt yourself?” he asks. He helps her stand, leads her back to where I’m waiting. She slurs her words and pats him on the cheek, and I wonder if he knew when he went to help her that she was homeless. I wouldn’t touch her. She smells. I step away from both of them, and watch him watch her. He’s concerned. He keeps his eyes on her until she’s stumbled off down the next street, and then he swings his head around to find me.\n\nIn this moment—right now—it’s so clear to me who Charlie is. She’s not as good as Silas. She loves him because he’s so different from her. Maybe that’s why she went to Brian, because she couldn’t live up to Silas.\n\nLike I can’t.\n\nHe half smiles at me, and I think he’s embarrassed to be caught caring. “Ready?”\n\nI want to tell him that what he did was nice, but nice is such a silly word for kindness. Anyone could pretend to be nice. What Silas did was innate. Boldfaced kindness. I haven’t had any thoughts like that. I think about the girl in class the first morning who dropped her books at my feet. She’d looked at me with fear. She expected me not to help. And more. What else?\n\nSilas and I walk in silence. He checks his phone every few minutes to make sure we’re headed in the right direction and I check his face. I wonder if this is what a crush feels like. If watching a man help a woman is supposed to illicit these types of feelings. And then we’re here. He points across the street and I nod.\n\n“Yeah, that’s it.”\n\nBut it’s almost not. The diner has transformed since I was here with Janette. It’s loud and pumping. There are men lined up on the sidewalk smoking; they part for us as we walk by. I can feel the bass in my ankles as we stand outside the doors. They open for us as a group leaves. A girl walks past me laughing, her pink fur jacket brushing against my face. Inside, people are defending their space with widened elbows and jutted hips. People glare at us as we walk by. This is my space, back off. I’m waiting for the rest of my group—keep moving. We bypass the few empty seats in favor of walking deeper into the building. We press through the crowd, walking sideways, and flinching when raucous laughter erupts next to us. A drink spills on my shoes, someone says sorry. I don’t even know who, because it’s so dark. And then someone calls our names.\n\n“Silas! Charlie! Over here!”\n\nA boy and…who was that girl who picked me up this morning? Annie…Amy?\n\n“Hey,” she says, as we draw close. “I can’t believe you actually came back here after last weekend.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\n7 phút mỗi ngày!

I think he’s Annie/Amy’s boyfriend by the way he looks at her—like they’re in on something together. Life, maybe.\n\nIt’s how Silas and I look at each other. Except we really are in on something together.\n\n“You acted like an ass,” she says.\n\n“Amy,” the spare boy says. “Don’t.”\n\nAmy!\n\nI want to know more about this person Silas punched.\n\n“He deserved it,” I say. Amy raises her eyebrows and shakes her head. Whatever she’s thinking, she’s too afraid to say it, because she turns away. I try her boyfriend next. “Don’t you think so?” I ask innocent-like. He shrugs. Goes to sit next to Amy. They’re all scared of me, I think, but why?\n\nI order a Coke. Amy’s head snaps around to look at me when she hears.\n\n“Regular Coke? Not Diet?”\n\n“Do I look like I need to drink diet?” I snap. She shrinks back. I don’t know where that came from—honest to god. I don’t even know how much I weigh. I decide to shut up and let Silas do the detective work before I offend someone again. He drops down next to Amy’s boyfriend and they begin to talk. The music makes it impossible to eavesdrop, and Amy is doing her best not to look at me, so I people-watch. People…they all have memories…know who they are. I’m jealous.\n\n“Let’s go, Charlie.” Silas is standing above me, waiting. Amy and her boyfriend are watching us from across the table. It’s a big table, I wonder who else is coming to join them and how many of those people hate me.\n\nOut of the restaurant and back onto the street. Silas clears his throat.\n\n“I got into a fight.”\n\n“I heard,” I say. “Did they tell you who it was?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nI wait and, when he doesn’t offer the information, I say, “Well…?”\n\n“I punched the owner in the face. Brian’s father.”\n\nMy head snaps around. “What the hell?”\n\n“Yeah,” he says. He rubs the scruff on his chin thoughtfully. “Because he said something about you…”\n\n“Me?” I get a sick feeling in my stomach. I know what’s coming, but I don’t know what’s coming.\n\n“He told me he was giving you a job as a waitress…”\n\nOkay, that’s not so bad. We need the money.\n\n“Because you were Brian’s girl. So I punched him, I guess.”\n\n“Damn.”\n\n“Yeah. That kid—Eller—told me we needed to leave before Brian’s dad called the cops.”\n\n“The cops?” I echo.\n\n“I guess Brian’s dad and my dad have worked together on some stuff. He agreed not to press charges last week because of it, but I’m not supposed to go back there. Also, Landon has been calling around, looking for me. Apparently my dad is wondering why I left practice. Everyone’s pretty pissed about that.”\n\n“Oops,” I say.\n\n“Yeah, oops.” He says it like he doesn’t care.\n\nWe go back the way we came, both of us quiet. We pass a few street artists I didn’t notice before. Two of them look like a couple. The man is playing the bagpipes while the woman draws pictures in colored chalk on the sidewalk. We step over the drawings, both of our heads down, examining. Silas takes out his camera and snaps a few pictures while I watch her turn a few lines into a couple kissing.\n\nA couple kissing. That reminds me.\n\n“We need to kiss,” I say to him.\n\nHe almost drops his phone. His eyes are big when he looks at me.\n\n“To see if something happens…like in the fairy tales we talked about.”\n\n“Oh,” he says. “Yeah, sure. Okay. Where? Now?”\n\nI roll my eyes and walk away from him, toward a fountain near a church. Silas follows behind. I want to see his face, but I don’t look. This is all business. I can’t make it into something else. It’s an experiment. That’s it.\n\nWhen we reach the fountain, we both sit down on the rim of it. I don’t want to do it this way, so I stand up and face him.\n\n“Okay,” I say, coming to stand in front of him. “Close your eyes.”\n\nHe does, but there’s a grin on his face.\n\n“Keep them closed,” I instruct. I don’t want him to see me. I barely know what I look like; I don’t know if my face contorts under pressure.\n\nHis head is tilted up, and mine is tilted down. I put my hands on his shoulders and feel his hands lift to my waist as he pulls me closer, between his knees. His hands slide up without warning, his thumbs grazing my stomach and then making a quick swipe along the underside of my bra. My stomach clenches.\n\n“Sorry,” he says. “I can’t see what I’m doing.”\n\nI smirk this time and I’m glad he can’t see my reaction right now. “Put your hands back on my waist,” I command.\n\nHe puts them too low and now his palms are on my ass. He squeezes a little, and I smack his arm.\n\n“What?” He laughs. “I can’t see!”\n\n“Up,” I say. He slides them a little higher, but slowly. I tingle down to my toes. “Higher,” I say, again.\n\nHe takes them up a quarter of an inch. “Is this—”\n\nBefore he can finish his sentence, I lean my face down and kiss him. He’s smiling at first, still in the middle of his little game, but when he feels my lips, his smile dissolves.\n\nHis mouth is soft. I lift my hands to his face and cup it as he pulls me tighter, wrapping his arms around my backside. I’m kissing down and he’s kissing up. At first, I expect to just give him a peck. That’s all they ever show in the fairy tales—a quick peck and the curse is broken. We’d have gotten our memories back by now if this were going to work. The experiment should be over, but neither of us stops.\n\nHe kisses with soft lips and a firm tongue. It’s not sloppy or wet, it moves in and out of my mouth sensually as his lips suck softly on mine. I run my fingers up the back of his neck and into his hair, and that’s when he stands, forcing me to take a step back and change position. I do a good job of hiding my gasp.\n\nNow I’m kissing up and he’s kissing down. Except he’s holding me to him, his arm wrapped around my waist, his free hand curled around the back of my neck. I cling to his shirt, dizzy. Soft lips, dragging…tongue between my lips…pressure on my back…something pressing between us that makes me feel a riot of heat. I push away, gasping.\n\nI stand there looking at him, and he looking at me.\n\nSomething has happened. It’s not our memories that have awoken, but something else that makes us feel drunk.\n\nAnd it occurs to me as I stand here, wanting him to kiss me again, that this is exactly what doesn’t need to happen. We’re going to want more of the new us and we’ll lose focus.\n\nHe slides a hand down his face as if to sober himself up. He smiles. “I don’t care what our real first kiss was,” he says. “That’s the one I want to remember.”\n\nI stare at his smile long enough to remember it, and then I turn and walk away.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

That was stupid. What was I thinking? A kiss isn’t going to bring our memories back. This isn’t a fairy tale.\n\nHe grabs my arm. “Hey. Slow down.” And then, “What are you thinking?”\n\nI keep walking in the direction I’m certain we came from. “I’m thinking I need to get home. I have to make sure Janette has eaten dinner…and…”\n\n“About us, Charlie.”\n\nI can feel him staring at me. “There is no us,” I say. I bring my eyes back to his. “Haven’t you heard? We were obviously broken up and I was dating Brian. His dad was giving me a job. I…”\n\n“We were an us, Charlie. And holy shit, I can see why.”\n\nI shake my head. We can’t lose focus. “That was your first kiss,” I say. “It could feel like that with anyone.”\n\n“So it felt that way for you too?” he asks, running around to stand in front of me.\n\nI consider telling him the truth. That if I were dead like Snow White and he kissed me like that, surely my heart would kick back to life. That I’d be the one to slay dragons for that kiss.\n\nBut we don’t have time to kiss like that. We need to find out what’s happened and how to reverse it.\n\n“I didn’t feel anything,” I say. “It was just a kiss and it didn’t work.” A lie that burns my insides it’s so foul. “I have to go.”\n\n“Charlie…”\n\n“I’ll see you tomorrow.” I lift a hand over my head and wave because I don’t want to turn around and look at him. I’m afraid. I want to be with him, but it’s not a good idea. Not until we figure more of this out. I think he’s going to follow me, so I wave over a cab. I open the door and look back at Silas to show him that I’m fine. He nods, and then lifts his phone to snap a picture of me. The first time she left me, he’s probably thinking. He then buries his hands in his pockets and turns in the direction of his car.\n\nI wait until he’s past the fountain before I lean down to speak to the driver. “Sorry, I changed my mind.” I slam the door and step back to the curb. I don’t have money for a cab anyway. I’ll go back to the diner and ask Amy for a ride.\n\nThe cabbie peels off and I duck down a different street so Silas won’t see me. I need to be alone. I need to think.\n\nAnother night of shitty sleep. Only this time, my lack of sleep wasn’t because I was worried about myself, or even worried about what made Charlie and me lose our memories. My lack of sleep was strictly because I had two things on my mind: our kiss, and Charlie’s reaction to our kiss.\n\nI don’t know why she walked away, or why she preferred to take a cab over riding with me. I could tell by the way she responded during the kiss that she felt what I was feeling. Of course it wasn’t like the kisses in fairy tales that could end a curse, but I don’t think either of us really expected it to. I’m not sure we really had any expectations for the kiss at all—just a little bit of hope.\n\nWhat I certainly didn’t expect was for everything else to take a backseat once her lips pressed against mine, but that’s exactly what happened. I stopped thinking about the reason we were kissing and everything we had been through all day. All I could think about was how she was clenching my shirt in her fists, pulling me closer, wanting more. I could hear the small gasps of air she was sucking in between kisses, because as soon as our mouths met, we were both breathless. And even though she stopped the kiss and stepped away, I could still see the dazed look on her face and the way her eyes lingered on my mouth.\n\nDespite all of it, though, she still turned and walked away. But if I’ve learned anything about Charlie in these last two days, it’s that there’s a reason for every move she makes. And it’s usually a good reason, which is why I didn’t try to stop her.\n\nMy phone receives a text, and I almost fall as I scramble out of the shower to get to it. I haven’t heard from her since we parted ways last night, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t beginning to worry.\n\nMy hope bleeds out of me when I see the text isn’t from Charlie. It’s from the kid I talked to at the diner last night, Eller.\n\nEller: Amy wants to know if Charlie rode with you to school. She’s not at home.\n\nI turn off the water, despite not even having rinsed off yet. I grab a towel with one hand and respond to his text with the other.\n\nMe: No, I haven’t even left my house yet. Has she tried her cell?\n\nAs soon as I send the text, I dial Charlie’s number and hit speaker, then set the phone down on the counter. I’m dressed by the time her voicemail picks up.\n\n“Shit,” I mutter as I end the call. I open the door and stop by my bedroom long enough to get into my shoes and grab my keys. I make it downstairs, but freeze before I reach the front door.\n\nThere’s a woman in the kitchen, and she isn’t Ezra.\n\n“Mom?”\n\nThe word comes out of my mouth before I realize I’m even speaking. She spins around, and even though I only recognize her from the pictures on the wall, I think I might feel something. I don’t know what it is. It’s not love or recognition. I’m just overcome with a sense of calmness.\n\nNo…it’s comfort. That’s what I feel.\n\n“Hey, sweetie,” she says with a bright smile that reaches the corners of her eyes. She’s preparing breakfast—or maybe she’s cleaning after just finishing up breakfast. “Did you see the mail I put on your dresser yesterday? And how are you feeling?”\n\nLandon looks more like her than I do. His jaw is soft, like hers. Mine is harsh, like my father’s. Landon carries himself like she does, too. Like life has been good to them.\n\nShe tilts her head and then closes the distance between us. “Silas, are you okay?”\n\nI take a step back when she tries to touch her hand to my forehead. “I’m fine.”\n\nShe tucks her hand to her chest like it offends her that I backed away. “Oh,” she says. “Okay. Well, good. You already missed school this week and you have a game tonight.” She walks back into the kitchen. “You shouldn’t stay out so late when you’re sick.”\n\nI stare at the back of her head, wondering why she would say that. This is the first time I’ve even seen her since all of this started. Ezra or my father must have told her about Charlie being here.\n\nI wonder if Charlie being here upset her. I wonder if she and my father share the same opinion of Charlie.\n\n“I feel fine now,” I reply. “I was with Charlie last night, that’s why I was home late.”\n\nShe doesn’t react to my baited comment. She doesn’t even look at me. I wait a few more seconds to see if she’s going to respond. When she doesn’t, I turn and head for the front door.\n\nLandon is in the front seat already when I reach the car. I open the back door and throw my backpack inside. When I open the front, he reaches his hand out to me. “This was ringing. Found it under your seat.”\n\nI take the phone from him. It’s Charlie’s.\n\n“She left her phone in my car?”\n\nLandon shrugs. I stare at the screen and there are several missed calls and texts. I see Brian’s name, along with Amy’s. I try to open them, but I’m prompted for a password.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\n7 phút mỗi ngày!

When I pick it back up again to try and figure out the password, Landon snatches it out of my hands.\n\n“Did you not learn anything from your fender bender last year?” He slaps the phone back down on the console.\n\nI’m uneasy. I don’t like that Charlie doesn’t have her phone with her. I don’t like that she didn’t ride to school with Amy. If she already left her house before Amy got there, who did she ride to school with? I’m not sure how I’ll react if I find out she caught a ride with Brian.\n\n“I mean this in the nicest way possible,” Landon says. I glance over at him—at the cautious look on his face. “But…is Charlie pregnant?”\n\nI slam on my breaks. Luckily there’s a light in front of us that turns red, so my reaction appears intentional.\n\n“Pregnant? Why? Why would you ask that? Did you hear that from someone?”\n\nLandon shakes his head. “No, it’s just…I don’t know. I’m trying to figure out what the hell is going on with you and that seemed like the only justifiable answer.”\n\n“I miss practice yesterday so you assume it’s because Charlie is pregnant?”\n\nLandon laughs under his breath. “It’s more than just that, Silas. It’s everything. You fighting with Brian, the practices you’ve missed all week, you ditching school half a day Monday, all day Tuesday, half a day Wednesday. It’s not like you.”\n\nI ditched school this week?\n\n“Also, you and Charlie have been acting strange when you’re together. Not like your usual selves. You forgot to pick me up after school, you stayed out past curfew on a school night. You’ve been really off this week, and I don’t know if you want to tell me what the hell is going on, but it’s really starting to worry me.”\n\nI watch as the disappointment fills his eyes.\n\nWe were close. He’s definitely a good brother, I can tell. He’s used to knowing all my secrets—all my thoughts. I wonder if these rides to and from school are when we normally share them. I wonder if I were to tell him what I’m really thinking—if he would even believe me.\n\n“The light’s green,” he says, facing forward.\n\nI begin driving again, but I don’t share any secrets with him. I don’t know what to say or how to even begin telling him the truth. I just know I don’t want to lie to him because that doesn’t seem like something the old Silas would do.\n\nWhen I pull into a parking spot, he opens his door and gets out.\n\n“Landon,” I say before he shuts the door. He leans down and looks at me. “I’m sorry. I’m just having an off week.”\n\nHe nods thoughtfully and turns his attention toward the school. He works his jaw back and forth and then locks eyes with me again. “Hopefully your week is back on before the game tonight,” he says. “You have a lot of pissed off teammates right now.”\n\nHe slams the door and begins walking in the direction of the school. I grab Charlie’s phone and head inside.\n\nI couldn’t find her in the halls, so I went to my first two classes. I’m headed to my third now, still with no word from her. I’m sure she just slept late and I’ll see her when we have class together fourth period. But still—something doesn’t feel right. Everything feels off.\n\nShe could just be avoiding me, but that doesn’t seem like something she would do. She wouldn’t go out of her way to let me know she doesn’t want to speak to me. She’d throw it in my face.\n\nI go to my locker to find my third period math book. I would check her locker to see if any of her textbooks are missing, but I don’t know the combination to her lock. It was written on her schedule, but I gave that to her yesterday.\n\n“Silas!”\n\nI turn around to see Andrew fighting his way through the crowded hallway like a fish swimming upstream. He finally gives up and yells, “Janette wants you to call her!” He turns and heads in the opposite direction again.\n\nJanette…Janette…Janette…\n\nCharlie’s sister!\n\nI find her name in the contacts in my phone. She answers on the first ring.\n\n“Silas?” she says.\n\n“Yeah, it’s me.”\n\n“Is Charlie with you?”\n\nI close my eyes, feeling the panic begin to settle in the pit of my stomach. “No,” I reply. “She didn’t come home last night?”\n\n“No,” Janette says. “I normally wouldn’t be worried, but she usually tells me if she’s not coming home. She never called and now she’s not responding to my texts.”\n\n“I have her phone.”\n\n“Why do you have her phone?”\n\n“She left it in my car,” I say. I close my locker and begin to head toward the exit. “We got into an argument last night and she got in a cab. I thought she was going straight home.”\n\nI stop walking when it hits me. She didn’t have lunch money yesterday—which means she wouldn’t have had cab fair last night.\n\n“I’m leaving school,” I tell Janette. “I’ll find her.”\n\nI hang up before I even give her a chance to respond. I sprint down the hallway toward the door that leads to the parking lot, but as soon as I round the corner, I stop short.\n\nAvril.\n\nShit. Now is not the time for this. I try to duck my head and walk past her, but she grabs the sleeve of my shirt. I stop walking and face her.\n\n“Avril, I can’t right now.” I point to the exit. “I need to leave. Kind of an emergency.”\n\nShe releases my shirt and folds her arms over her chest. “You never showed up during lunch yesterday. I thought maybe you were running late, but when I checked the cafeteria, you were there. With her.”\n\nChrist, I don’t have time for this. In fact, I think I’ll save myself any future trouble and just end it now.\n\nI sigh and run a hand through my hair. “Yeah,” I say. “Charlie and I…we decided to work things out.”\n\nAvril tilts her head and shoots me an incredulous look. “No, Silas. That isn’t what you want, and it’s definitely not going to work for me.”\n\nI look left, down the hall, and then right. When I see no one’s around, I take a step toward her. “Listen, Ms. Ashley,” I say, taking care to address her professionally. I look her directly in the eyes. “I don’t think you’re in any position to tell me how things are going to be between the two of us.”\n\nHer eyes immediately narrow. She stands silently for several seconds as though she’s waiting for me to laugh and tell her I’m only kidding. When I don’t falter, she huffs and shoves her hands against my chest, pushing me out of the way. The click of her heels begins to fade the further I sprint away from her—toward the exit.\n\nI’m knocking for a third time on Charlie’s front door when it finally flies open. Her mother is standing in front of me. Wild hair, wilder eyes. It’s as if hatred spews from her soul the moment she realizes I’m standing here.\n\n“What do you want?” she spits.\n\nI try to glance past her to get a look inside the house. She moves to block my view, so I point over her shoulder. “I need to talk to Charlie. Is she here?”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nMen gan cao chính là vì đã mắc virus viêm gan B!

The first thing I’m hit with is the smell. The air is stale. A fog of thick cigarette smoke fills the air and assaults my lungs. I hold my breath as I make my way through the living room. There’s a bottle of whiskey open on the bar, sitting next to an empty glass. Mail is scattered across the table—what looks like several days’ worth. It’s like this woman doesn’t even care enough to open any of it. The envelope on the top of the stack is addressed to Charlie.\n\nI move to pick it up, but hear the woman stalking into the house behind me. I make my way down the hall and see two doors to my right and one on the left. I push open the door to my left, just as Charlie’s mother begins screaming from behind me. I ignore her and make my way into the bedroom.\n\n“Charlie!” I yell. I glance around the room, knowing she isn’t here, but still hoping I’m wrong. If she isn’t here, I don’t know where else to look. I don’t remember any of the places we used to hang out.\n\nBut neither would Charlie, I guess.\n\n“Silas!” her mother yells from the doorway to the bedroom. “Get out! I’m calling the police!” She disappears from the doorway, probably to retrieve a phone. I continue my search for…I don’t even know. Charlie obviously isn’t here, but I keep looking around anyway, hoping to find something that could help.\n\nI know which side of the room is Charlie’s because of the picture of the gate above her bed. The one she said I took.\n\nI look around for clues, but find nothing. I remember her mentioning something about an attic in her closet, so I check the closet. There’s a small hole at the top of it. It looks like she uses her shelves as steps. “Charlie!” I call out.\n\nNothing.\n\n“Charlie, are you up there?”\n\nJust as I check the sturdiness of the bottom shelf with my foot, something slams against the side of my head. I turn, but immediately duck again when I see a plate fly out of the woman’s hand. It crashes against the wall next to my head. “Get out!” she screams. She’s looking for more things to throw, so I put my hands up in surrender.\n\n“I’m leaving,” I tell her. “I’ll leave!”\n\nShe moves out of the doorway to let me pass. She’s still yelling as I make my way down the hall. As I walk toward the front door, I swipe the letter off the bar that was addressed to Charlie. I don’t even bother telling Charlie’s mother to have her call me if she makes it home.\n\nI get in my car and pull back onto the street.\n\nWhere the hell is she?\n\nI wait until I’m a few miles away and then I pull over to check her phone again. Landon mentioned he heard it ringing under the seat, so I lean over and reach my hand beneath the seat. I pull out an empty soda can, a shoe and then finally—her wallet. I open it and sift through it, but find nothing I don’t already know.\n\nShe’s somewhere out there, without her phone or her wallet. She doesn’t have anyone’s numbers memorized. If she didn’t come home, where would she have gone?\n\nI punch the steering wheel. “Dammit, Silas!”\n\nI should have never let her leave by herself.\n\nThis is all my fault.\n\nMy phone receives an incoming text. The text is from Landon, wondering why I left school.\n\nI drop the phone back onto the seat and notice the letter I stole from Charlie’s house. There’s no return address. The date stamp in the top corner is from Tuesday—the day before all of this happened.\n\nI open the envelope and find several pages inside, folded together. Across the front, it reads, “Open immediately.”\n\nI unfold the pages and my eyes instantly fall to the two names written at the top of the page.\n\nCharlie and Silas,\n\nIt’s addressed to both of us? I keep reading.\n\nIf you don’t know why you’re reading this, then you’ve forgotten everything. You recognize no one, not even yourselves.\n\nPlease don’t panic, and read this letter in its entirety. We will share everything we know, which right now isn’t much.\n\nWhat the hell? My hands begin to shake as I continue reading.\n\nWe aren’t sure what happened, but we’re afraid if we don’t write it down, it might happen again. At least with everything written down and left in more than one place, we’ll be more prepared if it does happen again.\n\nOn the following pages, you’ll find all the information we know. Maybe it will help in some way.\n\n~Charlie and Silas.\n\nI stare at the names at the bottom of the page until my vision is blurry.\n\nI look at the names at the top of the page again. Charlie and Silas.\n\nI look at the names at the bottom. Charlie and Silas.\n\nWe wrote ourselves a letter?\n\nIt makes no sense. If we wrote ourselves a letter…\n\nI immediately flip to the pages that follow. The first two pages are things I already know. Our addresses, our phone numbers. Where we go to school, what our classes are, our siblings’ names, our parents’ names. I read through it all as fast as I possibly can.\n\nMy hands are shaking so badly by the third page, I can hardly read the handwriting. I set the page in my lap to finish. It’s more personal information—a list of things we’ve figured out about one another already, our relationship, how long we’ve been together. The letter mentions Brian’s name as someone who keeps texting Charlie. I skip over all the familiar information until I get close to the end of the third page.\n\nThe first memories either of us can recall are from Saturday, October 4th, around 11am. Today is Sunday, October 5th. We’re going to make a copy of this letter for ourselves, but will also mail copies in the morning, just to be safe.\n\nI flip to the fourth page and it’s dated Tuesday, October 7th.\n\nIt happened again. This time, it happened during history class on Monday, October 6th. It appears to have happened at the same time of day, 48 hours later. We don’t have anything new to add to the letter. We both did our best to stay away from friends and family the past day, faking illnesses. We’ve been calling one another with any information we know, but so far it seems this has happened twice. The first time being Saturday, the second being Monday. Wish we had more information, but we’re still kind of freaked out that this is happening and aren’t sure what to do about it. We’ll do what we did last time and mail copies of this letter to ourselves. Also, there will be a copy in the glove box of Silas’ car. That’s the first place we looked this time, so there’s a good chance you’ll look there again.\n\nI never checked the glove box.\n\nWe’ll keep the original letters somewhere safe so no one will find them. We’re afraid if anyone sees the letters, or if anyone suspects anything, they’ll think we’re going crazy. Everything will be in a box on the back of the third shelf of Silas’ bedroom closet. If this pattern continues, there’s a chance it could happen again on Wednesday at the same time. In case it does, this letter should arrive to both of you that day.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCô gái hóa thiên nga sau khi giảm 20kg!

It was mailed first thing Tuesday morning. And Wednesday at 11am is exactly when this happened to us.\n\nIf you find anything out that will help, add it to the next page and keep this going until we figure out what started it. And how to stop it.\n\nI flip to the last page, but it’s blank.\n\nI look at the clock. It’s 10:57am. It’s Friday. This happened to us almost 48 hours ago.\n\nMy chest is heaving.\n\nThis can’t be happening.\n\n48 hours will be up in less than three minutes.\n\nI flip open my console and search for a pen. I don’t find one, so I yank open the glove box. Right on top is a copy of the same letter with mine and Charlie’s names on it. I lift it up and there are several pens, so I grab one and flatten the paper out against the steering wheel.\n\nIt happened again, I write. My hands are shaking so bad, I drop the pen. I pick it up again and keep writing.\n\nAt 11am, Wednesday, October 8th, Charlie and I both lost our memories for what appears to be the third time in a row. Things we’ve learned in the last 48 hours:\n\n-Our fathers used to work together.\n\n-Charlie’s father is in prison.\n\nI’m writing as fast as I can, trying to figure out which points I need to write down first—which are the most important, because I’m almost out of time.\n\n-We visited a tarot reader on St. Philip Street. That might be worth checking out again.\n\n-Charlie mentioned a girl at school—called her The Shrimp. Said she wanted to talk to her.\n\n-Charlie has an attic in her bedroom closet. She spends a lot of time in there.\n\nI feel like I’m wasting time. I feel like I’m not adding anything of importance to this damn list. If this is true and it’s about to happen again, I won’t have time to mail a letter, much less make copies. Hopefully if I have it in my hands, I’ll be smart enough to read it and not just toss it aside.\n\nI bite the tip of the pen, attempting to focus on what to write next.\n\n-We grew up together, but now our families hate each other. They don’t want us together.\n\n-Silas was sleeping with the guidance counselor, Charlie with Brian Finley. We broke it off with both of them.\n\n-Landon is a good brother, you can probably trust him if you have to.\n\nI continue to write. I write about our tattoos, the Electric Crush Diner, Ezra and anything and everything I can recall from the last 48 hours.\n\nI look at the clock. 10:59.\n\nCharlie doesn’t know about this letter. If everything in this letter so far is accurate and this really has been happening to us since last Saturday, that means she’s about to forget everything she’s learned in the past 48 hours. And I have no idea how to find her. How to warn her.\n\nI press the pen to the paper again and write one last thing.\n\n-Charlie got into a cab on Bourbon Street last night and no one has seen her since. She doesn’t know about this letter. Find her. The first thing you need to do is find her. Please.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nMen gan cao chính là vì đã mắc virus viêm gan B!

        "content": "1\n\nTHE FIRST TIME I TRAVELED TO ANOTHER DIMENSION, I intended to take a life. Now I’m trying to save one.\n\nBut I can’t do that unless I save myself. At the moment, I’m running through the winding streets of a near-medieval Rome, trying not to get burned at the stake.\n\nWelcome to the nonstop fun of traveling through alternate universes.\n\n“She is the sorcerers’ daughter!” someone from the mob shouts. “She bears the tools of their witchcraft!” Her voice echoes off the cobblestones, just like the jeers from the crowd around her. A few of them hold burning torches, the better to chase me through the night.\n\nMy parents are scientists, not sorcerers. In this universe, looks like nobody knows the difference.\n\nWhat I’m carrying in the pockets of my robe or cloak or whatever you’d call this shapeless red thing—it’s not witchcraft. It’s a spyglass, a.k.a. a primitive handheld telescope. This six-inch-long gadget looks like a prop for steampunk cosplay: tortoiseshell sides, brass fittings, lenses ground by hand. But this might just be the tool that brings this dimension out of the Dark Ages—assuming it doesn’t get my entire family killed first.\n\nPanting, I dodge around every corner I come to, paying no attention to where I’m going. It’s not like I have any idea where I am anyway. When I leap into one of my other selves—the other Marguerites, who live in these parallel dimensions—I don’t get to access their memories. Some of their knowledge and ability carries over, but those are only the deeper, no-longer-wholly-conscious things. Knowing where the hell I am in this version of Rome? No such luck.\n\nAll I know is that I have to get away. Finding the Castel Sant’Angelo—and Paul, who should be there—well, that has to wait until I’m safe.\n\nOf course, I could escape this dimension at any moment, thanks to the heavy weight on a chain around my neck. To anyone in this dimension, and virtually anyone in ours, it would look like nothing more than a large, fairly elaborate locket—if they even noticed it, which they probably wouldn’t.\n\nThis isn’t any old necklace. This doesn’t belong in their reality. This is the Firebird.\n\nThe Firebird—the one and only device that allows human consciousness to travel through alternate dimensions. The invention of my mother, Dr. Sophia Kovalenka, with the help of my father, Dr. Henry Caine. The thing that can instantly transport my mind out of this universe completely and send me back to my own body, my own home, and safety. Even as I run through an alternate Rome in an ankle-length woolen dress and cloak, my stiff boots sliding against the rain-wet cobblestones on the road, I keep the Firebird clutched in one hand; if I lose this thing, I’m screwed.\n\nBut I won’t go. I can’t leave this dimension until I do what I came here to do.\n\nI must save Paul Markov.\n\nA couple more twists and turns through dark alleyways, and I finally manage to lose the mob. Although I can still hear murmuring and shouting in the distance, I have a moment to catch my breath. The frantic thumping of my heart begins to slow. My back is to a wall the color of terra-cotta; the only illumination comes from a few lanterns and candles visible through windows that have no glass. And, of course, the stars. I look upward, momentarily dazzled by how many more stars you can see in a sky unclouded by artificial light.\n\nThe view around me could have been taken from any one of a hundred early Italian paintings I’ve studied. This is a world without electricity, where only fire shows the way after dark. A cart pulled by a donkey rattles along in the distance, stacked high with bags of something, probably grain. Forget Wi-Fi, tablet computers, or airplanes—here, even steam engines are centuries away. It’s not that I’ve traveled back in time, though; the Firebirds don’t do that. But some dimensions develop faster, some slower. I’ve already been to futuristic worlds where everyone communicates by hologram and travels by hovership. It was only a matter of time before I reached one where the Renaissance is still in full swing.\n\nNot that this is exactly the same as our Renaissance: The clothing looks more like tenth or eleventh century to me, and yet the telescope my parents have invented didn’t come into being in our world until long after that. Also, somehow, there doesn’t seem to be any old-fashioned gender roles in place, or any gender roles at all. The priest who condemned me to the mob was a woman. I’ll cheer for equality later.\n\nThe man I spoke to told me I could find Paolo Markov of Russia at the Castel Sant’Angelo. I imagine Paul chained in a castle dungeon, being beaten or even tortured, and I want to cry.\n\nThis is no time for tears. Paul needs me. Crying can happen later.\n\nAnd once I’ve handled everything else, I’ll deal with Wyatt Conley.\n\nThe angry buzz of the crowd has faded. Where do I go now? I’m surrounded by dark, twisting alleys and a jumble of buildings filled with people I can’t trust. They said the Castel Sant’Angelo was to the west, but which way is west? Without the sun in the sky for me to judge by, I can’t guess what direction to go in. Still, I have to begin somewhere. One more deep breath, and I start toward a narrow street that leads down a seemingly quiet road—\n\n—then gasp as a hand closes over my shoulder.\n\n“Not that way,” a woman whispers. A noblewoman, I realize, her face all but hidden under her blue velvet cloak. “They may gather near the Pantheon.”\n\nI don’t know what that is, but if the mob is going to be there, I’ll head in another direction. “Thanks.”\n\n(The above conversation? Not verbatim. Both my new friend and I are speaking what I have to assume is either late-stage Latin or early Italian. I don’t know what it is exactly, but thanks to the deeply ingrained knowledge of this world’s Marguerite, I speak it.)\n\n“Your parents are leading us to wisdom,” the noblewoman says gently. “The others fear what they do not understand.”\n\nShe steps forward, just enough for some of the dim lighting to illuminate her face—thick golden hair, strong square jaw—and it’s all I can do not to gape at her.\n\nWe’ve met before.\n\nHer name is Romola. If I ever knew her last name, I’ve forgotten it. I encountered her in the very first alternate universe I ever visited: a futuristic London where she was the daughter of a duchess. Spoiled, rich, high on drugs, and drunk on champagne—Romola dragged me from nightclub to nightclub while I drank as much as she did. I was exhausted, afraid, and heartsick; it was only two days after the police told my family that my father had died. Dad turned out to be fine—well, if “fine” includes “kidnapped into an alternate dimension.” But I didn’t know that at the time. So those surreal, sick, miserable hours with Romola loom larger in my mind than they should. It seems like I knew her forever, not just for one weird day.\n\nI shouldn’t be surprised to see her again. We’ve learned that people usually cross paths in many dimensions—that no matter how different the worlds may be, fate draws us together.\n\n“Are you well?” Romola puts one hand to my forehead, like my mom did when I was little. “You seem dazed. No one could blame you, after what they’ve put you through.”\n\n“I’m fine. Really.” I pull myself together for the rest of my escape. “I need to get to the Castel Sant’Angelo. Which way should I go?”"

        "content": "Romola gives me directions. Most of the landmarks she names are unknown to me (Via Flaminia?), but she points along the road. I thank her and wave as I start running again.\n\nAt home, I think I could run a few miles without getting winded. This Marguerite doesn’t seem to get as much exercise. A stitch makes my gut clench; my breaths are coming too fast. Despite the cool air of early April, sweat slicks my skin. These thick woolen clothes feel as if they’re loaded with weights. And my boots—let’s just say shoemaking technology is a whole lot better at home. The blisters already swell at my heel and toes.\n\nBut I have to reach Paul as fast as I can. He could be in terrible danger—\n\nOr he could be fine. Maybe he’s one of the castle guards. He could even be a prince! You’ll probably interrupt him at a banquet or something.\n\nHow long has he been here? We tried not to panic when he hadn’t returned to our dimension after twenty-four hours; after forty-eight hours, we all knew something was wrong. We got really afraid when we searched for him in the Triadverse and realized he’d left but hadn’t come back home. Mom and Theo outdid themselves, coming up with a way to trace Paul’s next leap, which was into this dimension.\n\nPaul had no reason to come here. If he’d found what he was looking for—the cure for Theo—he would have come straight home. That was how we knew he’d been kidnapped. I haven’t been able to sleep since.\n\nJust get him back. We’ll figure the rest out later—how to save Theo, how to defeat Triad. That can all wait until you bring Paul home.\n\nI know the Castel Sant’Angelo as soon as I see it: an enormous stone structure at the top of a hill, lit by blazing torches. The firelight reveals the dull black gleam of cannons jutting from slots in the masonry. As I walk up, I see that the palace guards wear outfits simultaneously hilarious and intimidating: full striped breeches, brilliant yellow coats with puffy sleeves, metal breastplates and helmets, and swords that look like they could run through a human being in an instant. Although the soldiers come to attention as I step closer, obviously a winded teenage girl isn’t their idea of a threat.\n\nWhat if Paul’s a prisoner here? I have no idea how the guards are going to react, but there’s only one way to find out. A couple of deep breaths, and then I say as firmly as I can manage, “I’ve come to speak to Paul Markov of Russia.”\n\nThe guards look at each other and say nothing. Crap. Should I have called him Paolo, the Italian version of the name? Or Pavel, the Russian version? Or maybe he is a prisoner—or he isn’t actually here at all—\n\n“Follow me,” says one of the guards. “You can wait in the usual room.”\n\nThe usual room? I have to stifle a smile as I follow them to a small, stone-walled chamber. Of course Paul and I know each other in this world too.\n\nAlways, we find each other.\n\nIn my world, Paul is one of my parents’ research assistants as he works on his doctorate at Berkeley. For the first year and a half I knew him, I mostly thought he was strange: silent, awkward, too big for any room he was in. When he did speak, he was blunt. Most of the time he didn’t speak at all. But as time went on, I began to realize that his bluntness wasn’t him being rude or unkind—that instead it was a rough kind of honesty, sometimes hard to hear but always true. His awkwardness was only shyness, Paul’s belief that he had never fit in anywhere and never would. And the way he hung around my parents’ house wasn’t because he had no life and nowhere else to go. It was because nobody had ever accepted him before. He’d never been around a family who cared about each other, never had a real friend before he met my parents’ other assistant, Theo.\n\nAnd he had never fallen in love before he knew me. He just didn’t know how to say it.\n\nI’ve visited a few dozen dimensions by now. Paul and I have known each other in most of them; in many, we’re already together. Fate and mathematics bring us to each other time after time. Paul’s doctoral thesis presents a series of equations that prove destiny is real . . . but I don’t need the math to convince me. I’ve seen it for myself so many times, beginning in a Russia where the tsars never fell.\n\nFor a moment I think of Lieutenant Markov, the Paul I knew there, and my throat tightens. But that’s when a figure in a dark cloak appears in the stone archway of the room.\n\nPaul steps forward, looking at me so sadly that I ache for him without even knowing why. “You know you should not have come,” he says softly.\n\n“I had to.”\n\nBluffing your way through alternate dimensions can sometimes be tricky. When in doubt, remain silent as long as you can, and let the natives do the talking.\n\nAnd right now I’m only speaking to this world’s Paul. A few cues tip me off to the differences—subtle things anyone else might miss, like the way he walks, or his ease in this medieval chamber. My Paul’s consciousness—his soul—must be within this body, but semiconscious, unable to act, unable to think, hardly even able to remember. For the time being, he’s forgotten himself. That’s what happens to most people when they travel through the dimensions: they become absorbed into their other selves, unable to escape, or even think that they should escape.\n\nIt’s like a fairy tale in reverse. The prince is the one asleep in a glass coffin. I’m the one who’ll awaken him.\n\nIf only a kiss would work.\n\nPaul steps closer to me, and the flickering lanterns paint his face in golden light. He’s a big man, almost intimidatingly so—six foot two and broad-shouldered. This version isn’t as powerfully muscled, or maybe I just can’t tell beneath the black robes he wears.\n\nWait. Are these priest’s robes?\n\n“I have prayed and prayed,” Paul whispers. His gray eyes search mine, and I wish I didn’t recognize how lost he looks. How alone. “Surely I cannot abandon the vows I made to God. And yet if he did not want me to marry as other men do—to feel desire, and love—why would he have brought me to you?”\n\nEven without knowing any more of the story, this is enough to make me melt. This world’s Marguerite must be as in love with him as he is with her, or else they wouldn’t have had this conversation before. That makes it okay for me to say, “We’re brought together by a power greater than either of us. Something bigger than our own world.”\n\nIt’s not just a romantic saying; it’s scientific fact.\n\nPaul breathes out heavily like a man struggling. I wonder what his life has been like here—born in Russia, surely. Back in the Middle Ages, lots of children were more or less given to the church when they were small, so they had no real choice about whether to enter the priesthood or convent or whatever; if Paul’s already taken vows one month after his twentieth birthday, that must be what happened to him. Perhaps he traveled to Rome to serve the pope. Then he met the inventors’ daughter, and everything changed.\n\nI hope this world’s Paul and Marguerite will get their chance to be together. At any other time, I’d be tempted to stay here longer and help if I could. For now, though, nothing matters as much as rescuing my Paul and bringing him home.\n\n“Paul?” I step closer to him. The firelight catches the faint reddish tint in his pale brown hair. “Come here.”\n\n“We shouldn’t,” he says, like a man who desperately wishes we would."

        "content": "“Not for that. It’s all right.” I lift my eyes to his and smile as gently as I can. “Trust me.”\n\nAt that Paul straightens, nods, and closes the distance between us. It would be so easy to hold him, for him to put his arms around me—\n\n—but instead, when my hand brushes against his chest, I feel metal under the cloth. I reach beneath the collar of his robes and pull out his Firebird.\n\nHe still has it? I’d brought a second one with me, believing Conley would have stolen Paul’s. Maybe it’s broken. That would explain a lot.\n\nPaul stares at the necklace he just discovered hanging against his chest. To him it must have seemed to appear by magic. Obviously he can’t imagine what I’m up to, but he remains silent, trusting me completely. That makes it a little harder to manipulate the Firebird controls into the combination for a reminder. Because reminders hurt.\n\nPaul shouts in pain and jerks backward. But this is the part where my Paul wakes up inside him, when we’re together again and we can go back home.\n\nExcept that the reminder doesn’t work.\n\n“Why did you do that?” Father Paul lifts the Firebird and frowns. “What manner of device hangs around my neck?”\n\nHe doesn’t know. He really has no idea. Nothing like this has ever happened before. How could a reminder just . . . not work?\n\nI run one hand through my curly hair, thinking fast. “It’s my parents’ latest invention. It wasn’t supposed to hurt you—probably it’s broken. Here, let me have it.”\n\nPaul hands it back, still trusting me, but now wary of the Firebird itself. I don’t blame him. If only I were another science geek instead of the artist in the family, because then maybe I could fix this on my own. As it is, I might have to go home without Paul. Even though I know I could come back for him, maybe in only a few minutes, I can’t bear the thought of losing him again.\n\nYou’re the scientific wonder of the twenty-first century! I think as I look down at the Firebird. How can you go dead on me now? Maybe Conley broke it. But why bother breaking the Firebird when he could have stolen it for his own use?\n\nThe Firebird hasn’t gone dead. It isn’t broken. Every control reads normal. Yet when I double-check, I see that the Firebird is showing a reading I’ve never seen before.\n\nAnother man steps into the room, and my eyes go wide.\n\n“Allow me to interpret it for you,” he says with a smirk. “That’s what splintering looks like.”\n\nHis red robes look as if they belong in this strange medieval world, but his face is familiar. Too familiar.\n\nFate and mathematics don’t only bring you back to the people you love. They can also bring you to the people you hate.\n\nIn this world, they brought me back to Wyatt Conley.\n\n2\n\nWHO IS WYATT CONLEY, AND WHY IS HE SUCH A SON OF A bitch?\n\nMy parents explained the situation pretty well the day after I brought my father back home from our first adventure through the dimensions. That night we’d all been crying and happy and too freaked out to even think; then, once we woke up, we couldn’t stop talking about our adventures—everything we’d seen and done. Everyone we’d been.\n\nThat morning, it turned out, the physics faculty was holding a departmental meeting. Mom said that was as good a place to begin explaining as any, so my parents, Paul, Theo, and I headed to the university. As usual, I felt out of place as we walked through the hallways of the physics building. It’s like you can almost smell the math.\n\nAll of us went in together, interrupting the meeting in progress. All the science professors seated around the long oval table sat upright and stared.\n\n“Forgive our lateness,” my mother said. Even in her faded cardigan and mom jeans, she was immediately the person in charge. Mom has this effect on people. “I need to raise an urgent issue not on the agenda, namely Triad Corporation’s role in funding research into the Firebird device.”\n\n“As in, they shouldn’t have one anymore,” Theo chimed in. “We need to be independent from them, now.”\n\nDad stepped forward. “Triad has brought agents from another dimension into our own. These agents have been spying on us and attempting to direct and control our progress with the Firebirds. Their CEO, Wyatt Conley himself, is deeply involved in this—orchestrating it, even—in both worlds. To this end, he altered my daughter Marguerite’s dimensional resonance so that she can travel more effectively than anyone else in this world.”\n\nMom’s eyes flashed with anger as she cut in. “The procedure only works once in a dimension. By choosing our daughter, putting her in this dangerous position, Conley thought he could control us.”\n\n“Conley also hoped to blackmail Marguerite into working for him, operating as his spy in countless dimensions. That’s why I was kidnapped into an alternate universe in the first place,” Dad said.\n\nA silence followed. Everyone in the room just kept staring at us, this sea of huge eyes behind thick glasses. I wondered, Do they think my parents have finally lost their minds? The events Mom and Dad had just talked about sounded pretty fantastical, but every physicist in this department (and probably the world) knew that my parents were on the verge of a breakthrough—that dimensional travel was going to become a reality.\n\nThen Theo held up his hands in the time-out signal. “Uh, we probably ought to back this up. Turns out the Firebirds work! Dimensional travel is possible! I guess technically Dr. Caine went first, then Paul, and then Marguerite—but the point is, we’ve tested the devices. The Firebird is a success. Yeah, we should’ve led with that.”\n\n“Not that,” Paul said, expression grim.\n\nI realized what he was getting at, and my eyes went wide. Uh-oh.\n\nPaul stepped forward and said, as formally as if he were defending his dissertation, “We should have first informed you that Dr. Caine is alive.”\n\n“Oh!” Dad said, as Mom put her hand to her mouth. “Right! Thought that was sort of obvious—but ought to have gone over it anyway. I’m not dead! Body not lost at sea or in the river, wherever it was supposed to be. I’d been kidnapped into another dimension instead. Left out that important detail, didn’t we?”\n\n“Also, most of you will have heard that I killed Dr. Caine, when in fact I was framed for the crime. I am not guilty,” Paul continued. Then, with a glance at my dad, he finished, “Obviously.”\n\n“Because I’m alive.” Dad clapped his hands together, amused and embarrassed at the same time. “Of course. No wonder you’re all startled, since to you it’s like I just rose from the grave! Can’t say I blame you. We ought to have phoned a few people when I got back last night, but we got a bit carried away there, with the reunion and all. But no, I’m not dead. I’m absolutely fine. Never better.” The professors in front of us remained still, and I realized several of them were pale with shock. My father broke the awkward silence. “So, how are all of you? Ah, Terry! Changed your hair, I see. Looking good.”\n\nThat was when someone fainted.\n\nBelieve it or not, that has to count as a positive reaction. For years, the scientific community wrote off my parents as lunatics; a lot of people would like to do that again. Their colleagues finally accepted that cross-dimensional travel might be possible—but spies from other worlds? Wyatt Conley, inventor and entrepreneur, the mastermind behind a mysterious plot? Triad makes the most advanced personal electronics in the world, and sells them in stores you can find in any shopping center. Their cheery ads and emerald-green signs don’t seem like they’d belong to the front company for a James Bond–esque supervillain. And what was Conley supposed to have done to me? “Changed” me? “Blackmailed” me? Why would a powerful billionaire ever need to blackmail an average eighteen-year-old girl?"

        "content": "Or so the thinking goes.\n\nAfter the paramedics revived Professor Xavier, my parents, Theo, and Paul had to answer questions from the physics faculty for almost three hours. The president of the university has pleaded with Mom and Dad not to issue any public statements about the Firebird project for the time being. So far they’ve agreed, even though reporters have kept calling, and their questions have become more pointed, suggesting the public mood has shifted from breathless anticipation to doubt. Wyatt Conley hasn’t made any public statements either. As far as anyone in the general public knows, he’s still going about his usual routine, a thirty-year-old CEO who wears jeans instead of stuffy suits. His boyish face grins from beneath his curly auburn hair on the covers of business magazines. He even agreed to continue providing funding for my parents’ research going forward—or so he told the dean, who passed this info along to us probably hoping we’d decide we were just being paranoid jerks about the guy.\n\nThe other side of Conley lies just beneath that glossy surface.\n\nNot long after that meeting with the physics department, we got our first visit from the general counsel of Triad Corporation.\n\nHer name was Sumiko Takahara. If Wyatt Conley ran a global business while wearing blue jeans, it was because he had people like this behind him—armored with business suits and legalese. Ms. Takahara stood in our house as if she couldn’t believe she’d been sent on an errand this pedestrian; no doubt she spent more time suing megacorporations than talking to academics seated around a table that had been painted in rainbow swirls by me and Josie when we were little kids. Despite this, her professional demeanor never faltered.\n\n“The folders before you represent Mr. Conley’s best offer,” she said. Her gray business suit had a slight glimmer to it, like the skin of a shark. “You’ll find paperwork regarding several Swiss bank accounts, one for each of you. The amounts of money within—”\n\n“Would stun a maharaja,” Theo finished for her, then whistled, like, wow. Paul shot him a look, and Theo shrugged. “It’s true.”\n\nMs. Takahara seemed encouraged. “If Miss Caine will accept Triad’s offer of employment, I’m instructed to turn these accounts over to you, effective immediately.”\n\nMy mother handed her folder back unopened. “In other words, this is the price Wyatt Conley has set on our daughter,” she said. “His offer is declined.”\n\nThe chill in Mom’s voice would’ve cooled Siberia in winter. To Ms. Takahara’s credit, she wasn’t fazed. Instead, she looked at me. “The offer is Miss Caine’s to accept or refuse.”\n\nI slid my folder across the table, back to the lawyer. “Then tell Mr. Conley that Miss Caine refuses.”\n\nFinally Ms. Takahara hesitated. She couldn’t have seen many people turn down that kind of money. “Is that all you have to say in reply?”\n\nI thought it over. “You can also tell Conley to bite me.”\n\nSo that’s how that conference ended.\n\nMs. Takahara brought the next offer directly to my parents at the university, supposedly for them to pass along to me. But Conley was trying to bribe them with something they’d value far more than money—this time, he promised information.\n\n“All the research from the Triadverse’s Firebird project,” my mother said that night as we stood in line for pizza at the Cheese Board Collective. “He promised he would share everything they’d learned so far. Experimental data, theoretical work, every bit of it.”\n\nThat research had won the Triadverse version of my mother a Nobel Prize. “What did you guys say?\n\n“Honestly, the nerve of the man. The Triadverse is only a few years ahead of us. We’ll catch up.” In her calm, precise voice, my mother added, “Therefore we told Conley to stuff it.”\n\nI wanted to laugh, but I couldn’t help thinking that Conley had baited his hook more intelligently this time. For my parents, new knowledge would be the greatest temptation of all. “Are you sure? You guys would learn a lot.”\n\n“Marguerite, we never considered it for an instant.” Mom pulled my arms around her so that I was hugging her from behind. Her hands squeezed mine. “It wouldn’t matter if Wyatt Conley offered us the theory of everything, with cold fusion as the cherry on top. Nothing matters more than you girls. And there’s not one piece of information more important than our love for you.”\n\nI embraced her more tightly, and didn’t worry about Conley any more that evening.\n\nConley, however, was not done worrying about us. Nearly six weeks ago, he sent Ms. Takahara back to us. This time, she didn’t bother smiling.\n\n“Mr. Conley has improved his offer,” she began.\n\n“You said his last offer was his ‘best offer,’” Paul pointed out.\n\n“He has reconsidered, and encourages you to do the same. I’ve been instructed not to accept any final answer from you today.” Ms. Takahara didn’t make eye contact with anyone at the rainbow table; if she had, she’d have seen her “final answer” written all over our faces. Instead, she continued, “Take your time. Look this over, and discuss it among yourselves. For the time being, Mr. Conley intends to allow you to conduct your research in peace. He asks that you show him the same courtesy. To clarify, he requests that you refrain from traveling to the dimension corresponding to the coordinates in the document before you, henceforth referred to as the Triadverse. Not only would this violate his request, but he warns that the consequences could also be dangerous.”\n\n“Dangerous in scientific terms?” Paul asked. “Or is Conley merely threatening us?”\n\n“I don’t pass along threats,” Ms. Takahara huffed. Probably she thought she was telling the truth. Conley might have told her about dimensional travel, but there was no way he’d explained the full story. “Instead I have shared an extraordinarily generous offer from Triad Corporation. Consider it at your leisure. When Mr. Conley is ready to hear your answer, I’ll be back in touch.”\n\nAfter she left, Mom, Dad, Paul, and Theo got into a long, intense discussion about what Conley might do after he finally realized I’d never agree to work for him.\n\n“After the carrot comes the stick,” Dad said. They got to work then on superior tracking technology for the Firebirds, so that if Conley tried kidnapping any of us into another dimension again, we could find that person easily, tracing their jumps through the universes no matter how long or complicated the trail might become. Paul and Theo’s pet project was working up a way of monitoring Conley’s cross-dimensional activity; the day might come, Paul said, when we’d need to report Conley to the authorities.\n\n“What authorities?” I asked. Pretty sure the local cops don’t have the power to arrest people in other dimensions. “The FBI? Interpol?”\n\n“Jurisdiction is unclear,” Paul admitted. His hand closed over mine, warm and reassuring. “But if he threatens you, we’ll do whatever it takes to keep you safe.”\n\nI hugged him then, though at that point I felt safe enough. And Conley’s “terms” were easy enough. It’s not as though I was in some huge hurry to go back to the Triadverse, to revisit the Theo who deceived us all.\n\n(Or the Londonverse, where my other self drank too much, partly to kill the memory of Mom, Dad, and Josie dying in a horrible accident. Or the Oceanverse, which was actually a pretty cool place, but where I am probably criminally liable for wrecking a submarine. The Russiaverse—where I was the Grand Duchess Margarita, and Lieutenant Paul Markov was my personal guard and secret love—that world, I would return to. I haven’t, though. Going there again would mean revisiting that Paul’s death.)"

        "content": "But Conley knew something we didn’t. He knew we’d be compelled to return to the Triadverse soon, that we’d break the truce no matter what.\n\nHe knew what was about to happen to Theo.\n\n3\n\n“YOU TRICKED US,” I SAY TO CONLEY AS THE THREE OF US stand together in this stone room, in an Italian castle a world away. Paul looks from Wyatt Conley to me in confusion. “Saying you’d let us ‘think it over’—”\n\n“I did, didn’t I? You had weeks.” Conley straightens the red robes he wears as if he’s proud of them. “Then Paul Markov came to my dimension, even though you were warned it would be dangerous. He’s paying the price. It’s as simple as that.”\n\nMy dimension, he said. That means this is the Triadverse Conley I’m dealing with. Not that it makes much difference; the two Conleys work together, forming a conspiracy of one.\n\n“Cardinal Conley—I don’t understand.” This world’s Paul looks hopelessly bewildered, and no wonder. “What law have I broken?”\n\nConley smiles, all grace and benevolence. “This is between me and your lady fair, Father Paul. You can speak with her later. At the moment, she and I need to have a private conversation.”\n\nPaul steps between us. It’s more obvious than ever how much taller he is than Conley, how much stronger. “You can’t blame her for my weakness. I alone am responsible.”\n\nIs he amazing in every universe? I place one hand on Paul’s back, a small touch meant to say thank you.\n\nHowever, Conley remains in faux-kindly mode. “She won’t be punished. More than that, I hear her parents have been condemned for their studies by some of the local priests. Tonight I shall tell Her Holiness to officially declare them under her protection. You see? All will be well. Now go.”\n\nWhen Paul hesitates anyway, I murmur, “It’s all right. I’ll talk to you soon. Con . . . the cardinal and I don’t have much to say to each other.”\n\nAt last Paul turns to go, with one last look at me filled with such longing that my heart turns over. No sooner has he walked out, however, than Conley starts to laugh. “Oh, Marguerite. You and I have so much to say.”\n\n“What did you do to him?” I demand. “I tracked Paul here from your universe. I gave him a reminder, and the Firebird seems like it worked—”\n\n“Inconvenient, isn’t it? The way most people forget themselves between dimensions. You don’t appreciate your gift.”\n\nThat’s how it is for virtually everyone who travels through the multiverse. Without constant reminders, they quickly become silent, passive witnesses as those dimensions’ selves take over again. For Mom and Dad’s purposes, this doesn’t matter; the travelers remember everything they experienced through their “other selves” in each world. As long as you have your Firebird to remind you, you can still get back home and analyze what you learned.\n\nBut as I discovered on my first voyage, there are serious flaws in this procedure. For instance, you can lose a Firebird. It can be broken or stolen. And if you haven’t got your Firebird to remind you of yourself, then you’ll remain in that alternate dimension, within that other self—unconscious, paralyzed, and trapped—forever.\n\nThat’s why it would help to have a “perfect traveler,” someone who always remembered who she was, who remained in control no matter what.\n\nSo Triad turned me into one.\n\nI still don’t exactly understand what it was that was done to me. The device Triad loaned us seemed like any other piece of scientific equipment, and all I felt when the conversion happened was a moment of dizziness. Paul and my parents have explained it to me a dozen times, but it’s the kind of explanation you need a graduate degree in physics to fully understand.\n\nAll I know is that I can go to any dimension and remain in total control. Where to go, who to see, what to do: It’s entirely up to me. I also know that you can create only one traveler like me in any given universe. (Apparently, creating more than one exception to the laws of physics can seriously destabilize reality.)\n\nBut I still don’t understand why Wyatt Conley makes such a big deal out of it. “Other people can travel through dimensions! Okay, so, it’s more of a hassle. It doesn’t matter. You’ll use Nightthief on anyone—you proved that much. And you can travel as well as I can, so you can run your own creepy errands! So why do you keep after me?”\n\n“Important work is coming.” Conley’s smile fades. “Tricky work, some of it in universes I can’t reach. Triad needs you on our side, and soon. Be fair—I tried gentler persuasion, didn’t I? If you work with me, you’ll be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams. But it looks as though more extreme measures are necessary to get you on board.”\n\n“Like kidnapping Paul into this dimension, just like you did my dad?”\n\nTo my surprise, Conley shakes his head. The flickering orange light of the torches casts eerie shadows on his face. “Not exactly. This time, I’ve given you a challenge.”\n\n“You mean, because the reminder didn’t work.” How was Conley able to prevent my Paul from waking up? The Firebird seems to be functioning normally, except for this strange, unique reading I don’t understand.\n\nConley walks to the arched window and looks out, though in a world without electricity the view isn’t much to speak of. Moonlight paints the city dimly, a sprawl of buildings beneath the high hill of the castle. He says, “I told you already, but I suspect you were too upset to listen.”\n\n“Told me what?”\n\nHe turns back to me, once again cocky as he leans against the stone wall, arms folded across his chest. “Haven’t your parents discovered the danger yet? The possibility of splintering?”\n\nMy parents have never said word one about “splintering,” unless they were talking about literal splinters to be removed with tweezers. I open my mouth to tell Conley to stop playing games—\n\n—before realizing my parents did talk about this. They didn’t have a name for it yet, but they’d glimpsed the danger. But we’d had no idea how close that danger really was.\n\nDid that conversation happen only five nights ago? It feels like long, hard years have passed since then.\n\n“We ought to have recognized the potential before,” my mother said, talking about what I now know is called splintering. “Consciousness is energy. Energy consists of packets of quanta. It stands to reason that those packets could become . . . disassociated.”\n\n“Fragmented,” Paul said, his mood black. “The danger—”\n\n“Is remote,” my father cut in. The three of them were seated around the rainbow table, piles of paper and a glowing laptop evidence that they were hard at work, even after dinner on a weekend.\n\nNormally, Theo would have been working alongside them, but it was my turn to do the dishes, and he’d volunteered to help. Still, he couldn’t resist weighing in. “Are you sure of that, Henry?”\n\n“Incredibly sure. The odds against it are staggering. You’d almost have to do it on purpose, not that anyone’s likely to try such a damn fool thing.” Dad began typing on the laptop with such gusto that I knew he was trying to find something similarly unlikely to compare it to.\n\n“Great,” Theo muttered as he dried the salad spoons. “Like the Firebirds needed to get any more dangerous.”"

        "content": "I tried to reason with him. “You’re like one of those people who’s more scared of flying than driving, even though you’re way more likely to die in a car.”\n\n“Yeah, but if I’m in my 1981 Pontiac, at least I’m going out in style,” he said, and I laughed.\n\nPaul, from his place at the far side of the great room with my parents, shot me a look—not jealous, but hopeful. He wants things back to normal with Theo. That has always meant laughter.\n\nThe two of them have always been such good friends. They seem to have so little in common besides their interest in physics: Paul in his plain secondhand clothes, clueless about pop culture, while Theo wears fedoras and Mumford & Sons T-shirts. Yet they’re both young for doctoral students: Theo is twenty-two, and Paul just turned twenty. They both believed in Mom and Dad’s Firebird project when few others did. And they became a part of our weird little family. During that time—while everyone was involved with rewriting the laws of the natural universe as we knew them—emotions got confused.\n\n(“We ought to have expected it,” my mother said the first time I talked to my parents about all this. “Isolating individuals for long periods of time, away from any other likely romantic partners, particularly at this highly active stage of sexual development—strong emotional bonds were all but inevitable.”\n\n“We don’t care about each other only because we spent so much time together!” I protested.\n\n“Of course not, sweetheart.” Dad patted my hand. “Still, you have to admit it helped.”)\n\nBoth Paul and Theo fell in love with me. I fell in love with Paul.\n\nIt’s not that I don’t care about Theo; I do, deeply. I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t been attracted to him sometimes. For a brief time—when Paul had been framed for my father’s murder, and I was sick with grief and betrayal—I wondered whether Theo wasn’t the one for me after all.\n\nBut Paul and I came back to each other. And Theo was left on the outside looking in. Even though all three of us know nobody did anything wrong in this scenario, both Paul and I haven’t been able to help feeling awkward when Theo sees us together.\n\nThat night, however, I could almost believe nothing had changed. Our house in the Berkeley Hills looked exactly the same, with houseplants in every corner and on every shelf; the hallway black with chalkboard paint and thickly covered with equations; the rainbow table exactly where it should be; and stacks of books nearly as high as the furniture around us. Paul’s plain backpack and Theo’s battered messenger bag were nestled by the door along with my denim jacket and Mom’s bike helmet. The guys still practically live with us, like most of my parents’ grad assistants over the years.\n\nYet Paul and Theo have always been different from all the rest. Closer to us, more important. I knew that even before they finished assembling the first Firebird.\n\n“Thought Josie was going to get here tonight,” Theo said. “Wasn’t she coming in from San Diego?”\n\n“No, she said the surfing was too great today to pass up.” I squirted a little more dishwashing liquid into the sink. My rubber gloves were bright pink; Theo doesn’t bother with them, so suds covered his wet hands. The bubbles smelled like lemons. “She’ll fly in tomorrow.”\n\nTheo shook his head. “If the waves are that good, I’m surprised she’s coming at all. Not like Josie to pass up a chance to surf.”\n\n“After what happened to Dad, or what we thought happened to Dad . . .” I didn’t have to finish the sentence; the look Theo gave me told me he got it. My family has always been tight-knit, but now that the world’s turned against us—and we know what it would mean to lose each other—it’s like we can’t be close enough. With a smile I said, “So that’s her spring break. What about yours? Doing anything fun?”\n\n“I learned my lesson,” he said. Last year Theo dragged Paul to Vegas. Paul got thrown out of Caesar’s Palace for counting cards, because he didn’t understand that casinos consider “mastering probability theory” the same thing as “cheating.” He got to keep his winnings, but apparently he had to spend all that cash buying back Theo’s muscle car, which he’d wagered on a losing round of baccarat. They came home better friends than ever, but Paul said he didn’t see the point of spring break.\n\nTheo would always see the point of a party. But no matter how casual he acted about hanging around here, he wanted to stay close too.\n\nStill, there are other ways to travel. . . .\n\nI had meant to ask this for a while, but that night I finally felt comfortable enough with Theo to speak. “When are you going to take a trip of your own? See some other dimensions for yourself?”\n\nHe was quiet as he placed another plate in the dishwasher. Finally he said, “I don’t know that I ever will.”\n\n“Not ever?” During the past two years, Theo had been more psyched than anyone else at the thought of seeing new worlds.\n\nHe turned to me, and I’m not sure I’ve ever seen his expression so serious. “I’ve seen what it’s like from the other side, Marguerite. That part isn’t as much fun.”\n\nLast fall and winter, whenever we talked to Theo, whenever he persuaded us to do something—we weren’t talking to our Theo. It was his body, but the consciousness inside belonged to the Theo Beck from another universe—acting as Conley’s ally and his spy. That Theo was the one who arranged my father’s kidnapping and framed Paul for his murder. The one who turned me into Conley’s ideal “perfect traveler,” then persuaded me to take my first voyages with the Firebird.\n\nThe one I clung to after I thought my dad was dead—the one I kissed in another dimension, and at my weakest moment nearly slept with—and the one Theo blames for destroying whatever the two of us might have had.\n\nTheo’s wrong about that. For me it was always Paul; it could never have been anyone else. But the other Theo’s shadow hangs heavy between us.\n\n“I still crave it sometimes, you know.” Theo stared out the kitchen window into the darkness beyond. “The Nightthief.”\n\nNightthief is the one and only way to cheat the rules of traveling between universes. It’s a drug—emerald-green, injectable, invented in the Triadverse—that allows a dimensional traveler to maintain control. See, a traveler on Nightthief remains as much in control as I am. But the drug has certain serious drawbacks. One, it’s addictive and can cause seizures. Two, Nightthief can be made out of what we’d consider common household chemicals—but if you’re in a universe where those aren’t common, you won’t be able to supply yourself. (While consciousness can travel through dimensions easily, it’s very, very hard for physical matter to travel. So forget bringing any Nightthief with you.) Three, the drug wears off after a day or so, which means if you don’t have more on hand, you’re screwed.\n\nWhen the other Theo took ours over, he took that drug for months on end. My Theo—the one who stood beside me that night, our elbows brushing—he had to go through the withdrawal. Worse, he had to live with the memories of another Theo using his body to endanger and betray us all.\n\n“It’s not always like that,” I said quietly. “Paul and I take care of our other selves. We try to live their lives, as much as we can. We’d never make them do anything they wouldn’t want to do on their own.”"

        "content": "Though at least once, in the Russiaverse, I might have stepped over the line.\n\n“Not judging you guys. I know it’s different, the way you and Paul handle the journeys. It’s just—” Theo went very still. “I’ve seen who I am as a traveler. I justified some of the worst stuff you could ever do to anybody, because I told myself I was ‘protecting’ you. Really I was delivering you straight into Conley’s hands.”\n\n“Hey. Nobody got hurt.” I nearly touched his shoulder before I remembered I was wearing wet rubber gloves.\n\nHe shook his head, and his smile was hard. “No thanks to me. Come on. I helped them kidnap Henry.” Theo gestured toward my father, who at this point might as well be Theo’s adoptive dad too. “I framed my best friend for murder. And I dragged you off on an extremely dangerous trip, just to prove Wyatt Conley could use you after all.”\n\n“You didn’t do any of that!”\n\n“A version of me did. You’ve said a hundred times—every one of our other selves out there is the same in some important way. We have the same framework or essence or soul, whatever you want to call it.” Theo leaned against the refrigerator and sighed. “Listen to me. When a physicist starts talking about souls, we are officially off the map.”\n\n“I don’t think it’s silly or crazy—talking about souls.” I never did, really, but after these journeys began, I learned how real they are, how much they mean.\n\nTheo shrugged. “The point is, we’ve all seen the danger. Apparently, when I get a little bit of power, it goes to my head. Never, ever would I want to turn into a guy who could do anything like what that other Theo did to all of you. So I think it’s better if I stay on the sidelines.”\n\nAlthough I wanted to reassure him, I couldn’t. I’ve come to believe that there really is something that flows through every version of us, one common identity that outweighs our different situations in the various worlds. The ruthlessness and self-delusion of that other Theo—they have to be a part of this Theo, too, don’t they?\n\nWhen our eyes met, I knew he could tell what I was thinking. Theo cast down his dark eyes with shame for things he never even chose to do.\n\nThe shadow that had haunted us these past three months fell between us again. He turned back to the dishes, attacking them with new vigor; I took my place at his side just like before. Neither of us spoke, because there was nothing more to say.\n\nAfterward, Theo buried himself in his work, taking his laptop onto the back deck. “I need some quiet,” he said, and my parents had the good grace not to ask why. Paul walked him out, though, and it took all my self-control not to eavesdrop on their conversation.\n\nAs soon as the door to the deck was closed, Mom blithely said, “Is Paul staying over?”\n\n“Mom.”\n\n“I’m not prying.” She took her seat at the rainbow table again, ready to get back to work. “I simply need to know what I ought to plan for breakfast.”\n\nOur living room might as well be an unofficial university dorm. When grad students work that closely with my parents, they practically move in.\n\nBut Mom wasn’t asking whether she should grab blankets for the couch.\n\nMost parents would be freaked out even thinking about their teenage kids having sex. Mine haven’t got around to the freaking-out stage yet, because they are so completely thrilled Paul and I are together.\n\n(Back in January, during that first conversation with my parents about my new relationship with Paul, Mom—prompted by absolutely nothing I’d said, by the way—made a suggestion. “You’ll need a method of birth control. We’ll have to review efficacy rates for condoms, birth control pills, hormonal inserts—”\n\n“Oh, my God.” My face had to have turned carnelian red. “That’s—we’re not—it isn’t an issue yet.”\n\nWhich was not addressing what happened in the Russiaverse, but that’s between me and Paul. And another Marguerite, a few dimensions away.\n\n“Will be eventually,” Dad said smoothly. “You and Paul are young, you’re healthy, obviously attracted to each other—it’s only a matter of time. And you don’t want to fall pregnant this early in life, do you?”\n\nMom brightened as she looked at Dad. “Though the genetic combination—their various talents and potential—think of it, Henry. Were they to reproduce, our grandchild would be extraordinary.”\n\n“Wouldn’t she? Or he?” Dad leaned back on the sofa, where they were relaxing and I was staring in disbelief. “The two of you should have a baby together, by all means. Just not now.”\n\n“Whoa. Slow down.” I held up my hands, like I could physically stop them from this whole line of thought. They didn’t listen.\n\n“Pregnancy and child rearing would seriously interrupt your art studies, and Paul’s defense of his dissertation, at least in the immediate future,” Mom mused. I think if I’d handed her a calendar, she would have started counting off months until the ideal conception date.\n\nDad took her hand. “You know, Sophie, we could help out. Even be primary caretakers while Marguerite and Paul finished their education. We always wanted another little one around. So the kids might as well get started.” My mother beamed at him, like this was the best idea ever.\n\nWhen I could speak again, I said, “You guys—you’re—you two are the worst role models ever.”\n\n“We are, aren’t we?” Mom’s smile became so wicked that I finally realized they’d been putting me on—mostly. I balled up one of Josie’s discarded T-shirts and threw it at them, which made them laugh. Much later that night, as my mother and I sat out on the back deck, she finally spoke to me more seriously. “You know how much your father and I like Paul. No—how much we love him.”\n\nI nodded. We were side by side on the wooden steps that led down into our small, nearly vertical scrap of a backyard. The light around us was provided by the strings of tropical-fish lights Josie had put up a long time ago. “This isn’t going to mess things up between everyone, is it?”\n\nMom put her arm around me. “Marguerite, as dear as Paul is to me, you are my daughter and always my priority. If you and Paul have problems, or break up, I’m on your side. Even if you’re in the wrong! You know you come first.”\n\nWhich was really sweet, but not what I’d been asking. Splitting up with Paul—that wasn’t ever going to happen. Really I was worrying about Theo.\n\nShe continued, “We are all very much a part of each other’s lives, and our work. To some extent that will always be true. No matter what happens between you and Paul in the future, that connection will remain.” Her fingers combed through my hair, just as curly-ratty as hers. “Lifelong relationships are complicated. It’s a great deal for a new romance to carry.”\n\n“I know,” I said. But I’d already realized Paul and I were meant to be. Destined, in a real, literal, provable sense. You can’t fight destiny, and I didn’t even want to try.)\n\nPaul hasn’t slept over at my house since we got together in this world. Partly that’s because we feel hyperobserved, partly out of consideration for Theo’s feelings, but mostly because we’re taking this slow. Making sure the moment is right."

        "content": "In the Russiaverse, we rushed it and then some.\n\nThat night when they discovered the risk of splintering, Dad returned to the great room just when Paul came in from the deck. As he took my hand, Paul said to my parents, “Do you want to run the numbers again?”\n\nMom and Dad exchanged a look before she said, “We’ve got enough for tonight. We’ll run it through at the lab tomorrow morning and take it from there.” She raised one eyebrow. “In other words, yes, you two have some free time.”\n\nThis was less of a treat than they seemed to think. Making out in my room isn’t as much fun when I have to wonder if my parents can hear, or worse, if they’re cheering us on. I used to be considerate and listen to my music on headphones. These days, I turn the speakers up to eleven.\n\nPaul stood there awkwardly; he still hasn’t figured out how to navigate the path between “respect for his mentors” and “desire for their daughter.” So I did the talking. “Okay, we’ll just—”\n\nThat’s when we heard a thump on the deck.\n\n“Theo?” I let go of Paul to walk toward the sliding door, but Dad got there first. He pulled it open, startled, and swore as he rushed outside. I hurried after him, then stopped short, frozen in horror.\n\nTheo lay sprawled out on the deck. His laptop rested where it had fallen a few feet away, and the light from the screen illuminated Theo’s face—the blankness in his eyes, the slackness of his mouth.\n\nOh God. Is he dead? He looks dead—\n\nTheo’s body shuddered, then convulsed. His limbs tensed as they started shaking so hard they hammered against the deck. I gasped. “Oh, my God. He’s having a seizure.”\n\n“Call 911,” Paul said, just behind me, and I heard Mom’s footsteps pounding as she ran for her cell phone.\n\n“What do we do?” Dad said as we both kneeled by Theo’s side. “Do we put something in his mouth so he won’t swallow his tongue?”\n\n“No! Definitely don’t do that.” I’d heard that was a bad idea with seizure patients, but I didn’t know what else to do. “Just—be here with him.” Could Theo hear us? I had no idea. I only knew that my blood seemed to flush hot and run cold, back and forth, over and over again. My hands were shaking. As frightened as I was, I knew Theo had to have been so much more scared than me. So I whispered, “It’s all right. We’re going to get you to the hospital, okay? We’ve got you, Theo.”\n\nDad muttered, “Has he ever mentioned—any illness, any other episodes—”\n\n“No.” Paul looked grim.\n\nCould he be sick? Please just let him be sick. But we all knew Theo didn’t have epilepsy. We knew what was to blame.\n\nNightthief. The drug Wyatt Conley’s spy had pumped into Theo’s body over and over again, for months—the stuff he had told me still gave him the shakes—it had done more damage than we knew. Theo hadn’t been getting better; he’d been getting worse.\n\nConley had told us he didn’t like relying on Nightthief for his dimensional travelers; we knew the drug could be harmful. But that night was the very first time I realized just how serious this might be.\n\nThe first time I realized Theo might die.\n\nAnd the night Paul decided to do whatever it took to save him.\n\n4\n\nTHE WIND BLOWS THROUGH THE GLASSLESS WINDOW OF the Castel Sant’Angelo, ruffling the veil I wear over my curly hair. “You knew Paul would have to come to the Triadverse,” I say to Conley. “To look for a cure, for Theo.”\n\n“I can give you that, too. You can save them both.” He chuckles softly. “You’ll be rescuing Theo from the effects of his Triadverse self’s journey to your dimension—and rescuing Paul from the consequences of his journey into mine.”\n\n“You deliberately . . . splintered Paul?”\n\nConley just grins wider. “Guilty as charged.”\n\nNow I know why the reminder didn’t work. It could only have awakened Paul’s soul if—if his entire soul were within this world’s version.\n\nBut Wyatt Conley has torn Paul’s soul apart.\n\nNothing I could scream at Conley would be foul enough. There are no curses to carry the obscenity and fury in my heart.\n\nInstead, I throw myself at him.\n\nOur bodies collide as I slam him against the wall, knocking the breath out of Conley in a surprised huff. We both topple to the side, but I’m able to catch myself. He lands flat on the stone, red robes a puddle around him. I wish they were blood.\n\nA terrible calm comes over me. Maybe this is what people feel like before they commit murder. “You killed Paul.”\n\n“Not kill,” Conley pants. He’s still fighting to breathe normally. “I splintered him. Not the same thing at all.”\n\n“You tore his soul into pieces! You broke him apart!”\n\nConley’s grin isn’t as cocky when he’s sprawled on the floor. “But you can put him back together again.”\n\nWhat does he mean? Then I look down again at the Firebird, at that reading I’ve never seen before.\n\n“Reminders can serve another function, it turns out,” Conley says. “They can reawaken someone’s soul or capture an individual splinter. You thought you’d lost Paul, but you’ve already rescued him—part of him, that is.”\n\nA splinter of my Paul’s soul hangs on this chain, in a locket I hold in my hand.\n\nI lean over Conley to grip his robes in one fist. “Tell me where you hid the other splinters of Paul’s soul.”\n\n“If you want that information,” Conley says, “You’ll have to earn it.”\n\nFive nights ago, at the hospital, my parents were able to stay with Theo, while Paul and I were stuck in the ER waiting area. If I ran a hospital, I would try to make a space like that feel comforting. Instead, the room seemed like it was designed to punish us: stark fluorescent light, uncomfortable chairs, a pile of dog-eared magazines at least a year old, and a television blaring in the corner with some obnoxious TV judge yelling at people stupid enough to go on the show.\n\nPaul and I held hands, but we were too freaked out to comfort each other. We just hung on.\n\nI whispered, “Theo never said anything about still feeling bad. He admitted he still craved Nightthief, but nothing like this.”\n\n“He hasn’t confided in me much lately.” Paul stared down at his beat-up gray tennis shoes; he even has to buy his footwear secondhand. “I believed his silence was about you. About us. It never occurred to me to think he might be more worried about something else.”\n\nAll the awkwardness of the past three months—all the odd silences, the times Theo didn’t come around when we expected him—why did I assume that was all about my relationship with Paul? Because I thought Theo was jealous, or at least hurt, I never looked deeper. I didn’t ask the questions I should’ve asked. All the while, Theo suffered alone.\n\nPaul murmured, “I should have known.”\n\n“He hasn’t been around enough for us to see it.” True. But it was amazing how little that helped.\n\n“The signs were there. I failed to put them together.” He slumped forward in his chair, shoulders hunched, like he’d just picked up something heavy. “I noticed that he hasn’t been driving as much. That he went out less. I thought—after what happened, I thought Theo simply wanted time to pull himself together. But I should’ve known he’d never skip spring break.”"

        "content": "With that, Paul buried his head in his hands, and I leaned against his shoulder. I don’t know whether I was trying to give him strength, or take some from him. Either way, it didn’t work.\n\nMy parents didn’t emerge until nearly one in the morning. The light washed them out, highlighting every wrinkle and gray hair, but that’s not why they seemed to have aged ten years in three hours. Fear had hollowed them out.\n\nMy voice cracked as I said, “How is he?”\n\n“Not good.” Dad sank into a chair across from us. “Theo’s in no immediate danger, but his vital signs, his blood work—the doctors have no idea what to make of it.”\n\nMom started counting off points on her fingers as she paced between the rows of chairs. “He’s anemic. His lungs show signs of damage, as if he’d been suffering from untreated tuberculosis for years, which of course he hasn’t. And the muscles in his feet and lower legs—the degeneration made one physician suggest Theo might have early-stage distal muscular dystrophy.”\n\nI bit my lower lip, hoping the pain would keep back any tears. Paul’s voice sounded thick as he said, “He doesn’t, does he?”\n\nMy mother shook her head. “Possible, but doubtful. We all know the most probable cause.”\n\nNightthief.\n\n“Whatever negative effects the drug had on Theo’s body didn’t end when he stopped taking it,” Mom said. “Apparently the damage had already reached a point of no return.”\n\nHer meaning was obvious, but I didn’t understand. I wouldn’t let myself understand. Something in my brain refused to take in the words. “He’ll get better, though. Right? Now that he’s finally seeing a doctor?”\n\nDad spoke gently. “At this point, we don’t know. The medical team doesn’t understand his condition, which means they can’t form any meaningful prognosis. But the fact that his condition has continued to worsen this long after his final dose of Nightthief . . . well, that worries me.”\n\nMom made a small sound in her throat—the sound she makes when she won’t let herself cry out in pain. I’d heard that sound from her only once before, when she opened the door to see a policeman standing there, his hat in his hand. It was like she’d known she was about to be told that my father was dead, but she refused to believe it until the moment she had to.\n\nThat night, she believed the worst about Theo.\n\nHe might die because Wyatt Conley sent a spy to drug him over and over and over again, for months. Because of Conley’s power play. Because of his grandiose dreams of dominating the multiverse.\n\nI hadn’t thought it was possible to hate Wyatt Conley more than I already did. I was wrong.\n\nI beat myself up about it that whole night.\n\nWhy had I acted so stupidly around Theo? He accepted that I’d chosen Paul, and he never once tried to make either of us feel weird about it. If I’d taken Theo at his word, believed him that he was okay with Paul and me being together, maybe we would’ve spent more time with him. Then maybe I would have noticed things going wrong.\n\nThe next day, after Josie arrived, I told her as much, but she didn’t buy it.\n\n“Listen, Marguerite.” Josie stood in our kitchen, drinking her third cup of coffee. The caffeine was supposed to make up for the fact that she’d changed her flight to 6:30 a.m. to get home ASAP. “You didn’t know because Theo didn’t want you to know. He hid his symptoms from everyone, and that’s on him.”\n\n“It’s not like Theo to keep that kind of secret,” I protested. Paul? Sure. He locks his feelings and his fears inside, sometimes for too long. But Theo likes to gripe about everything from hockey teams to parking in Berkeley. “If he didn’t feel strange about being around me and Paul, he would’ve said something.”\n\nJosie put down her mug and placed her hands on my shoulders. “I know it’s been easy to lose sight of this lately, what with Triad treating you like the Holy Grail, but not everything is about you, okay?”\n\nThat stung. “Then why did Theo stop telling us everything all of a sudden?”\n\n“Honestly? My guess is the symptoms scared him. Probably he was trying to deny anything serious was going on. He couldn’t tell you guys what was happening until he admitted it to himself.”\n\nI weighed what she said, and sensed there was truth to it. No, it wasn’t the whole story. But at least I felt like I could breathe again.\n\n“When can we see Theo?” Josie asked. “Gotta be visiting hours already, right? When do his parents get here from DC?”\n\n“Didn’t Theo tell you? They’re not in DC anymore.” The Becks work for the US Foreign Service, which means they move all around the globe. Most of the time they’re in Washington—learning new languages, doing diplomatic work there—but Theo was born in Chile, went to kindergarten in the Philippines, and attended middle school in Iceland. Sometimes I think that’s why he’s such a hipster; he’s trying to prove he’s mastered American culture, that he’s even better at it than the rest of us. “Two months ago, his parents got transferred to Mongolia. It’s not exactly a quick trip back. They won’t be able to get here for a couple of days.”\n\n“His mom and dad have got to be freaking out.” Josie sighed and rubbed her temples. “Well, we can take care of Theo until they get here. So where’s loverboy?”\n\n“Please stop calling Paul that.”\n\n“Why?” Josie smiled for the first time since we picked her up at the airport. “He’s not your loverboy yet?”\n\nThe pacing of my sex life is none of Josie’s business. Although I can tell her pretty much anything, Josie doesn’t understand the need Paul and I have to take it slow. She’s always gone for brief, intense romances herself.\n\nSo that morning I said, “You’ll embarrass him. He’s still figuring out how to navigate—this.” I made a vague gesture meant to take in the house, the tangled interrelationships we have, all of it.\n\n“Paul never went out with anyone before, did he?” Josie asked.\n\nI shook my head. He’d confessed that he’d kissed only two girls before me, and one of those was a single-second, closed-lips kiss that hardly even counts. This is what happens when a guy goes to college before he even hits puberty. Paul spent most of the past decade surrounded by girls five to ten years older than him.\n\nThat said, Paul got extremely good at kissing very, very fast.\n\nJosie nodded, her expression overly innocent. “And you and Paul—you’re good?”\n\n“Yeah, we are.”\n\nPaul drove me up to Muir Woods once, where we held hands while he explained the origins of the cosmos. I took him into San Francisco to see the Golden Girls Drag Show, which confused him nearly as much as it would’ve puzzled an extraterrestrial visiting Earth for the first time. We ride the bus into Oakland so we can watch movies at the elegant old cinema at Grand Lake, then have coffee and doughnuts at this cool old bakeshop nearby. So we have our special occasions. But in some ways the best part is that Paul and I can just be. Some evenings, I’ll paint for hours while he reads or works with equations, and by now we drift in and out of conversation easily, naturally. We’re good together—better than I would ever have dreamed possible six months ago."

        "content": "“I still can’t wrap my head around it,” Josie admitted as she walked past me to flop down on the sofa. She wore the same fleece pullover and leggings she would for a 5K run. “You couldn’t stand the guy, and now you’re in love with him.”\n\n“That’s not true.”\n\nShe raised an eyebrow.\n\n“Can’t stand is way too strong. I just thought he was . . . kind of weird. That’s all.”\n\n“Paul is kind of weird,” Josie said. “But in a good way.”\n\n“Then why are you being so strange about my getting together with him?”\n\nInstead of answering right away, Josie sipped her coffee, deep in thought. Finally she said, “Right after you came home with Dad, when you’d first fallen for Paul—you told me you realized you loved him while you were in the Russiaverse.”\n\nI remembered Lieutenant Markov waltzing with me alone in an enormous, ornate room of the Winter Palace, music playing from a phonograph in the corner, his hand warm against the small of my back. “Yeah. I did.”\n\n“Okay.” She hesitated, and I realized she was worried about offending me. Josie usually doesn’t worry about offending anyone. I knew it would be bad. “Are you sure it’s not just that world’s Paul you loved? Because when you told me about it—Marguerite, you fell really deeply for Lieutenant Markov. And even though he’s another version of Paul, they’re not the same guy.”\n\nObviously she expected me to blow up. But I wasn’t angry. Josie hasn’t traveled to other dimensions yet. That means she can’t grasp what I’ve learned.\n\n“Lieutenant Markov isn’t identical to my Paul Markov,” I said. “I know that. Still, something in them is the same. Something deep—the deepest, most meaningful part of who we are, that’s the part that lives in every universe. In every person we could ever be. I fell in love with that Paul, and my Paul, because I fell in love with what’s the same inside them—their souls, if you want to call them that. Or soul. Singular. One.”\n\nMy sister didn’t look convinced. “You really believe that? That you’re in love with every Paul, everywhere?”\n\n“I don’t believe,” I said. “I know.”\n\nWhen we visited Theo at the hospital that afternoon, everything about his room there was depressing: the plain, cheerless walls; the TV hanging from a black metal adjustable arm, showing a generic action movie from cable; and above all the plastic-framed adjustable bed. Theo had propped himself up, and he grinned when he saw us, but he was still so pale. Yet he sounded cheerful, for our sakes. “About time you two showed up.”\n\n“I brought some things from your apartment,” Paul said.\n\n“Not that you’ll be here very long!” I quickly added. “But you might want your stuff.”\n\n“All the comforts of home, huh?” Theo smiled. God, we were all trying so hard to be upbeat, and failing. “Okay, hit me.”\n\n“First of all,” I said, “that blue hospital gown? Not your best look. So, here.” From the cardboard box I took Theo’s straw hat, the one he bought at the beach last summer.\n\nHe let me set it on his head, then reset it at a rakish angle. “I don’t even need a mirror to tell me how much better I look.”\n\n“Smokin’ hot,” I promised.\n\nPaul didn’t bother reassuring him, just plowed on. “I also brought your e-reader, your cell, some headphones, and a pair of argyle socks.”\n\nWith a frown, Theo said, “Socks?”\n\n“In case your feet got cold,” Paul replied, like that should be obvious.\n\nTheo sighed. “You’re worrying about my toes getting chilly, little brother? Trust me, we have bigger problems to deal with.”\n\nI think he meant it as a joke, but Paul and I looked at each other with growing dread.\n\nWe already knew what we had to do. In the car afterward, we didn’t even discuss other options—just argued over who would get to save Theo. I said, “You know I should be the one to go.”\n\n“No,” Paul said, in that zero-arguments tone that sometimes drives me crazy.\n\n“The version of you in the Triadverse ran off to South America, remember?” We appear in our alternate selves, wherever they happen to be, and we have to deal with whatever situation we leap into. I’ve fallen down staircases, woken up underwater, you name it.\n\nPaul insisted, “I wouldn’t have to be in Triad headquarters to get the information. All I need is a computer, a wireless link, and the ability to get through Triad’s security.”\n\n“You know Conley has to have beefed up his systems since then.”\n\n“That would be the logical move, yes.”\n\n“So you see the problems?”\n\n“I may not be the ideal candidate, but you’re even worse.”\n\nPaul’s bluntness felt like a smack in the face. I’ve learned not to get my feelings hurt too quickly, though. He never means to be hurtful; he just doesn’t know how to phrase things. So I said only, “You want to explain that?”\n\n“At least I have a chance of getting the information while remaining undetected,” Paul pointed out. “You have none.”\n\nI didn’t want him to be right, but he was. My knowledge of computers begins and ends with hit power switch, magic box comes on. Why do I have to be the only right-brained person in the family? Paul is hardly an expert hacker, but he knows a thing or two about getting past firewalls. “When did you get so good with computer security, anyway?”\n\nPaul sighed. “Theo taught me.”\n\nHis free hand rested against my leg; I tangled my fingers with his. “He took you under his wing from day one, huh?”\n\n“Not day one. But early on—after I called out an error in one of his equations. At first he was pissed off, but the next afternoon he said he’d rather have me on his side.”\n\nThat sounded about right. Theo has an ego the size of the Golden Gate Bridge. His saving grace is that he’s as ready to admire others as he is to admire himself.\n\nPaul spoke so tentatively, like he’d never tried to say any of this out loud before and didn’t know how. “I’d never gone out to a club before Theo took me. Never even drank a beer. So he took me out with him. He called it ‘remedial adolescence.’”\n\nNo wonder Paul idolized Theo. But he didn’t know the other Theo. Not like I did. I was the one who’d been led into Triad headquarters for Wyatt Conley to take captive, the one who was physically attacked in a submarine. The one Theo kissed and claimed to care about while he was faking Dad’s death and framing Paul for the murder.\n\nTheo has so much goodness in him—but there’s darkness there too. Even that afternoon, when I was more afraid for him than I’d ever been, I couldn’t help questioning how much the Triadverse’s Theo and our own have in common.\n\nPaul had no such doubts. His loyalty to Theo was, and is, absolute. If he had to break Wyatt Conley’s truce to save Theo, so be it.\n\nConley had said only that we had to stay out of the Triadverse. But the Triadverse invented Nightthief—which meant if any cure or treatment existed, that was the only world where we’d be able to find it.\n\nFirst the two of us headed back to Paul’s dorm room. Since we had no idea how long his journey would be, we needed him to leave from a location that could be sealed off to be sure nobody was in the wrong place when he returned, and his physical body once again started interacting with our universe. Like, if he left from our couch, but somebody was sitting on that couch the moment he came back—my parents aren’t one hundred percent certain what would happen, but it could lead to both bodies being fused together in a very permanent, possibly fatal, and definitely gross way."

        "content": "By traveling from his dorm room and having me lock the door behind me, Paul was doing his part to make sure we never found out whether that fusion thing would be for real.\n\nWe got him settled on his bed, stretched out and comfortable; after a few rough landings in other dimensions, you learn the value of a soft reentry. I sat beside him and leaned over so that our faces nearly touched.\n\n“If you think Conley’s onto you—even for a second—come back,” I pleaded. “We can figure out other ways of getting a cure.”\n\n“Not without bargaining for it, and that’s not going to happen.” Paul brushed a curl away from my cheek. In almost a whisper—because he was still shy about saying it—he told me, “I love you.”\n\n“And I love you. In any world, any universe.”\n\nHis smile was crooked. “This world is enough.” Then he became more serious. “Sometimes I look at you, and I think—if I didn’t know we shared a destiny, if I hadn’t seen the proof for myself, I’d never believe this was real. That you could love me as much as I love you.”\n\nI’ve felt exactly the same. “We do share a destiny. We’re meant to be. Which means you’re meant to come back to me. Got it?”\n\n“Got it.” When Paul settled his hands on his chest, he put his fingers on his Firebird. Our eyes met, and then—\n\nThen nothing. Paul didn’t vanish; there was no light, no pop, no sign that he had even been there. Of course, his body remained in our dimension, remains there still, right on his dorm-room bed, but unseen, untouchable. No scientific instrument on Earth could find it.\n\nSlowly I rested my hand on the space where he’d lain, where only a moment before I would’ve been able to feel his heartbeat. His blanket was still warm. I told myself that Paul could do anything, that he’d save Theo and come back home.\n\nBut Conley was waiting for him. Even as I pressed my palm against the warmth Paul had left behind, his soul was being torn apart.\n\n5\n\nAFTER MY PARENTS FINISHED CHEWING ME OUT FOR NOT telling them about Paul’s trip to the Triadverse to find a cure for Theo, they settled in with me for the wait.\n\n“Paul said he’d come back after twenty-four hours,” I told them as we sat up late on the back deck. “Or as close to it as he can manage. Even if he hasn’t found a cure for Theo yet, he’ll check back in just to let us know he’s safe.”\n\n“Twenty-four hours!” My father shook his head, expression grim. “If Conley’s figured out how to monitor dimensional traffic, his people could be on Paul within minutes.”\n\n“But that dimension’s Paul already got away from Triad,” I protested. “He escaped to Ecuador.”\n\nThis placated my dad not at all. “You think a global tech mogul like Wyatt Conley can’t hire operatives in Ecuador?”\n\nMom laid her hand on Dad’s shoulder. “Henry, please. This isn’t helping.”\n\nI imagined Paul being held prisoner. Being interrogated by men to whom the Geneva Convention wouldn’t apply. My stomach cramped, as if in sympathetic pain. Had we been stupid to leave my parents out of it? I said, “Could you have done something to help him get into the Triadverse without being detected?”\n\n“Nothing Paul isn’t capable of doing himself,” my mother replied. “He has a chance. Paul knew the odds. He did this to help his best friend. We should respect his decision.”\n\nShe was speaking to my father then, who didn’t reply. I figured it would be a long time before we were forgiven—or, at least, that it wouldn’t happen until Paul had given Theo a miracle cure that restored him to health.\n\nBut it didn’t take that long.\n\nBy the time thirty-six hours had passed and Paul still hadn’t returned, Dad was beyond yelling at me about it. Like the rest of us, he was too frightened for that.\n\n“They wouldn’t kill him,” I said, pacing through the great room. “Would they?”\n\n“Unlikely. Conley would be a fool to simply eliminate Paul rather than taking him captive as leverage.” My mother turned out to have an instinct for criminal behavior. “Yet Conley would also be foolish not to tell us he’s taken Paul captive. My instinct is therefore to assume that Paul remains at liberty. But if he is free, why hasn’t he returned?”\n\n“Maybe he’s in the heart of working on Theo’s cure,” Dad said.\n\n“Maybe,” I repeated. But none of us believed it.\n\nTwo full days after Paul’s journey into the Triadverse, none of us had slept more than a couple of hours at a time. Dad now believed Conley had captured Paul but was making us sweat it out; Mom theorized that Paul could have experienced a Firebird malfunction.\n\nIn either case, we knew there was only one way to find out for sure.\n\n“I should be the one to go,” my father said. “I’ve left these travels to the young ones for long enough.”\n\n“Dad, no. I’m the perfect traveler. It should be me.”\n\nFor the past three and a half months, Paul and I had periodically visited brand-new universes, to further test the Firebirds and to see more of the multiverse’s wonders. Mostly I saw a lot of dimensions very similar to my own, but where my parents were working on different research, teaching at a different university, et cetera. But even those worlds could offer a wealth of data the Firebird project team could use. I went because I could travel more effectively than anyone else; Paul went with me because he had the experience, and because it was dangerous to travel alone.\n\nNow, however, I would have to make a trip on my own—the riskiest one of all.\n\nMom sat at the rainbow table, her hands steepled in front of her. “You go in. You immediately use the locator function to find Paul. As soon as you know where he is, you return and give us the full report. We’ll decide how to proceed from there.”\n\n“Okay.” Did that mean actually reach Paul if I could, or just get the information? I decided I’d make that decision when I arrived in the Triadverse.\n\n“If Paul’s Firebird malfunctioned,” Mom continued, “he may have tried to return to our universe but instead traveled to a new dimension. Your Firebird is set to track his. You’ll be able to follow in his dimensional footsteps, so to speak—to travel to whatever world he might have ended up in.”\n\n“Please.” Dad’s voice broke. “Let me be the one to do this. For all three of you to be in danger at once—”\n\nMy parents love Paul and Theo only slightly less than they love Josie and me. They’re the sons Mom and Dad never had. I knew they were as afraid for Paul as I was, but seeing my father this upset ripped me open inside. “Dad, I can do this better than anyone else. I have the ability; I have the experience. Meanwhile, you have the actual scientific knowledge about the Firebirds. If you go, and Conley winds up capturing you, too? We’re going to be totally screwed.”\n\nThis made him laugh a little, as it was meant to. I knew I couldn’t make this situation easier for any of us, but at least I could get my father to accept what had to be done.\n\nOr maybe not. Maybe Dad still hated the idea of my going to rescue Paul as much as he ever had. But he didn’t object again, not even in the moment when I embraced them both and leaped out of my own world—"

        "content": "—and thudded into my Triadverse self, who was at a coffee shop, staring at her phone. I gripped the side of the table and looked around, half expecting Triad goons to barge through the door with tasers. Instead, I only saw the usual crowd of people tapping on laptops or talking over their cappuccinos.\n\nImmediately I used the Firebird locator function—and it came up zero. My Paul was nowhere in this dimension.\n\nAt that moment, it seemed like good news. Conley hadn’t captured Paul! It was just a Firebird malfunction, like Mom said. With a smile on my face, I set the tracker into motion, so the Firebird would travel along Paul’s path and take me to him.\n\nWhich is how I wound up in medieval Rome, questioning everyone I could find about “Paolo Markov of Russia” while trying to dodge accusations of witchcraft.\n\nHow I ended up here, and now, bargaining with Wyatt Conley for Theo’s cure and Paul’s soul.\n\nCardinal Conley gets to his feet and straightens himself. It hits me for the first time how ridiculous Wyatt Conley looks in clerical robes. It seems as if no universe could ever allow him to be a man of the cloth; whatever else Conley is, he’s not a religious, moral person. Then again, in the Middle Ages, most cardinals weren’t. The position let men gain tremendous influence and political power. No wonder this universe’s Conley became a cardinal.\n\nAs solemnly as the church elder he pretends to be, Conley says, “If you’re worrying about being splintered yourself, Marguerite, let me put your mind at ease. Perfect travelers can’t splinter—it’s yet another of our advantages. But generally, a soul can be broken into as many pieces as you’d like. Dozens, even hundreds.”\n\nThe horror dizzies me. Is Paul torn apart even now, scattered across the entire multiverse?\n\n“Don’t worry,” Conley says, in a tone that could be mistaken for concern if you didn’t know him well. His red robes look almost satanic in the firelight. “I went easy on you, didn’t smash him up too much. Four pieces, in four different dimensions. You just rescued the first one! See how easy it is? I gave you this splinter as a sign of good faith.”\n\nDoes he want me to thank him? “What do I have to do to get the coordinates for the other three dimensions?” Three more pieces of Paul’s soul. Three more worlds I have to find, and three more rescue missions.\n\nDisgustingly satisfied with himself, Conley says, “I have a few errands for you.”\n\nThere it is—Triad Corporation’s iron fist closing around me.\n\nBut if this is the price of Paul’s soul, I have to pay.\n\n“Let me explain precisely what I need.” Conley stands up straighter; his cardinal’s robes lend him an authority he doesn’t deserve. “Out there in the multiverse are two other dimensions where your parents are very close to developing Firebird technology. I would prefer that they didn’t.”\n\nI fold my arms. “You mean you want to have all the power.”\n\n“Who wouldn’t?” He shrugs. “Here’s how this is going to work. I have two dimensions working on Firebird research that need to be sabotaged as soon as possible. The next two splinters of Paul’s soul are hidden in those dimensions.” Conley’s thin fingers point at my own Firebird locket. “If you allow it, I can program your Firebird. You’ll receive the coordinates for the first of those dimensions—as well as a program you can use as a computer virus to destroy your parents’ research and your most valuable hardware.”\n\n“How do I collect each splinter?” I clutch the spare Firebird more tightly. “The same way I’d give him a reminder? Just hold it against him, hit the combination on the locket?”\n\n“Exactly. See? Easy as pie.”\n\nSomeday, when I have the luxury, I’m going to punch Wyatt Conley in the face. Hard.\n\nOblivious to my anger—or amused by it—Conley continues, “Collecting the second splinter of Paul’s soul will unlock the coordinates for the next dimension I need you to sabotage. Lather, rinse, repeat. Once you’ve done what I need you to do in each dimension, and gathered those two splinters, then you’ll come to the home office. Coordinates will be programmed into your Firebird with the rest.”\n\n“The home office?” He must mean the Triadverse. “I don’t want to go there.”\n\n“I have to check your work. When I go through your Firebird data, I’ll know whether you deployed the virus. If you’ve been a good girl—”\n\nIf there is any phrase I hate more than “good girl,” I don’t know what it is, and the words sound even more loathsome coming from Conley.\n\n“—and you’ve stalled those dimensions’ research for a while, I’ll give you both the formula for Theo’s treatment and the coordinates for the final splinter of Paul’s soul. That final splinter is my insurance, you see. Your job is quite simple.”\n\nLike it would ever be “simple” for me to betray my parents, much less while I’m afraid for both Paul’s and Theo’s lives. “You could have sent anyone to be your saboteur, or gone yourself.”\n\n“There are dimensions where my reach is . . . limited.” It seems to gall Conley that he has to admit that he’s not omnipotent. “And yes, I could send certain other emissaries, but in order to do the kind of tricky work I’m looking for, they’d have to take Nightthief for a very, very long time. You know what that does to people now, don’t you?”\n\nI remember Theo thrashing on our deck, body in spasm, skin pale. “Yes, I do.”\n\n“We didn’t expect this one side effect. See, after a while, exposure to Nightthief takes away your ability to dream—hence the name. Sleep researchers still aren’t sure exactly why the ability to dream is so vitally important, but it is. Once you’ve lost it . . . let’s say mental processes start to break down rapidly, and dramatically.”\n\nThere’s something uniquely cruel about Theo dying because Wyatt Conley will no longer let him dream.\n\n“As for the physiological damage—well, I don’t have to fill you in on that, do I? You’ve found out for yourself what Nightthief does to the lungs, the muscles, et cetera. But don’t worry about that. The lack of REM sleep will kill Theo before any of the rest progresses much further.” Conley smiles, though I don’t know what he thinks is so funny. I imagine taking one of the swords from the castle guards outside and stabbing it straight into his gut. He continues, “So, to sum up, do these errands for me, and in return, you get not one but two grand prizes. Once you report in to the home office, I’ll give you the formula for a solution that should ease Theo’s symptoms, maybe even reverse them.”\n\n“That doesn’t sound like a cure.” If Conley intends to keep Theo sick—use him as a kind of hostage—I swear I’ll go for one of the swords right now.\n\nInstead, Conley becomes serious and—possibly—sincere. “Marguerite, this is the best we have. If I could cure Nightthief exposure quickly, I wouldn’t need you, would I? But this treatment gives him a chance to heal. Keep treating him, and eventually, his body’s immune system should take care of the rest.”\n\nShould. Not will. Still, I believe he’s telling the truth, only because he really wouldn’t need me if he had a cure."

        "content": "Even more earnestly, Conley says, “And at the home office, I’ll also give you the coordinates for the final splinter of Paul’s soul—for the universe where you can put him together again. No errands to run there; that dimension isn’t one of my problems. You can just go get Paul and bring him home. Sound good?”\n\nI imagine reawakening Paul, holding him in my arms, and telling him I’ll never let him go. I need that even more than Conley will guess—more than I can ever let him know. “It sounds . . . necessary.”\n\nThere’s that smirk again. “Is that a yes?”\n\nSomeday, I’m going to make Wyatt Conley sorry he ever screwed around with us. For now I have to play along. “Yes. Now give me what I need to get the job done.”\n\nHe holds out his hands to gesture at the stone walls and flaming torches. “I’ll give you the data, but I need a little more sophisticated setup than this. Shall we return to your home turf? I can transmit the first coordinates from there.”\n\nMy dimension, he means. I’m relieved to hear him suggest it. Mom and Dad deserve to know what’s going on. By now they must be frantic. “Okay.”\n\nConley takes his own Firebird from the collar of his robe. With its intricate design and dull bronze color, his Firebird looks . . . mysterious. More antique than cutting edge. It seems to belong to this dimension more than our own. “Shall we?”\n\n“I want to say goodbye to Paul. This Paul.”\n\n“You get so sentimental about the duplicates,” Conley says, shaking his head. “But I won’t tease you about it. My other self is just as bad.”\n\nThat’s definitely not the vibe I’ve gotten from our world’s Conley, but whatever. “Besides, you need to give that order protecting my parents. From the ‘witchcraft’ mobs. Right?”\n\n“Oh, right! You got it.” He thumps the side of his head, like Duh. “I’ll talk to Her Holiness right away. Pope Martha the Third. Rumor has it she puts our Borgias to shame.” As he begins to walk away, Conley adds, “Listen, someday, when you’re on board with this and we’ve been working together for a while, you and I will look back on this and laugh.”\n\nI don’t dignify that with an answer. Instead, I wait for him to leave, and then search for Father Paul.\n\nAs I guessed, he’s been waiting. Paul kneels in a small room off to the side that turns out to be a private chapel. A mural of Jesus raising Lazarus covers one wall, perspective wonky and faces stylized—the art, too, looks older than the Renaissance. They haven’t rediscovered the techniques of the ancient world yet; this civilization is still crawling away from the Dark Ages. Light flickers from a handful of tallow candles in iron stands. Paul—Father Paul—is praying, but when I walk in he quickly murmurs something in Latin, crosses himself, and turns his face to me. “Is everything well? The cardinal will take care of your family?”\n\n“I hope so.” This chapel has no pews, only kneelers. So I go to my knees beside him; it’s the only way to be close enough.\n\nPaul glances at the doorway, no doubt worried we’ll be seen. “You could claim sanctuary here. The sisters would keep you safe until your parents fall under the cardinal’s protection.”\n\nNuns? I’ll be spending the night in a convent? This world’s Marguerite doesn’t get to have nearly enough fun.\n\nShe’ll be near her Paul, though. That’s enough. All I want now is to be back with mine.\n\nI bring my hand to Paul’s face and brush my fingers along his cheek. He draws in a sharp breath. Have they even kissed? Paul tentatively covers my hand with his, so that I’m cradling the side of his face. If I were to kiss him right now, he wouldn’t resist. He’d kiss me back so passionately that—well, this chapel might be deconsecrated.\n\nBut I stole the Grand Duchess Marguerite’s first and only night with Lieutenant Markov. I won’t steal any more firsts with Paul. Each me should get to experience that moment.\n\n“Everything’s going to be all right,” I say, to myself as much as to him. “You and I—we’ll figure it out.”\n\n“Ours is not an easy path.”\n\nPaul’s old-fashioned, elegant phrasing reminds me of Lieutenant Markov, which reminds me of falling in love with Paul in the first place, and now I can’t take it anymore. I have to go home; the journey to save my Paul has to begin.\n\n“The path isn’t easy,” I tell him. “But we’re walking it together.”\n\nIt’s true in every world, everywhere. I have to believe that.\n\nI take hold of my Firebird and Paul’s—the two of them around my neck, one of them carrying a splinter of Paul’s soul—and leap back home.\n\nI fully expected my parents to freak out about what Wyatt Conley had done and the bargain we’d struck. What I didn’t expect is that they would flat-out refuse to let me go.\n\n“Dad—” I pull my hair back with both hands, trying to calm myself. “You know we don’t have any other choice.”\n\n“We don’t know that,” Dad insists. “We have to at least try to get Paul out of this ourselves. We tracked him to the—Medievalverse, didn’t we? So we could figure out a way to trace the other splinters. We don’t need Conley’s bloody coordinates.”\n\n“We already have the coordinates.” Theo sits on the sofa in a plaid shirt and jeans, a pale shadow of his usual self. His plastic hospital bracelet still hangs around one wrist. “Why wouldn’t we use them?”\n\nThe data packet arrived from Triad Corporation a couple of hours ago, just after I returned. While we can already see the first coordinates, the ones that will lead us to the second two dimensions have to be “unlocked”—by storing data that proves I’ve done Conley’s dirty work. Each betrayal wins me one more dimension, one more piece of Paul’s soul.\n\nMy parents don’t even want to download the information into the Firebirds. Dad insists, “We can manage on our own.”\n\nTheo groans. “Come on, Henry. We didn’t even know splintering was possible until a couple of days ago. Tracing those splinters in alternate dimensions? We could be months away from cracking that.”\n\n“Or days,” Mom says. “The only reason we haven’t solved the puzzle is because we haven’t yet tried. Obviously our counterparts in another universe managed to master this; if they hadn’t, Conley wouldn’t have the technology to splinter Paul in the first place. What they did, we can do. We only need to begin.”\n\nDad nods, becoming encouraged. “And if Triad could think of a treatment for Theo’s condition, well, then, so can we.”\n\n“We’re not physicians, Henry.” My mother glanced at the bottle of Nightthief on the shelves, the one they’d hardly begun to study. “Still, we must make an attempt. Obeying Conley has to be our last resort.”\n\n“This is the last resort!” I don’t argue with my parents that much anymore, but right now I feel like I could scream. “Don’t you get it? Paul has been torn apart. If I don’t do this, we might never get him back. If even one of Paul’s other selves dies, then—then we’ve lost him forever.”\n\nMom’s expression is more sympathetic, but she still shakes her head. “That is a risk, yes. But a fairly remote one given his age and health.”"

        "content": "I remember Lieutenant Markov, bloodied and weak, dying in the Russian snow. “That depends on where he is. He could be somewhere dangerous; Conley would do that. You know he would.”\n\nMy parents exchange a look, and Dad sighs. “We’ll give it one week. If we can’t make substantive progress on finding Paul ourselves in that time, then—well, then we’ll consider it.”\n\n“Consider it?” How can they do this? I step away from them, hurt and confused.\n\n“Enough of this,” Mom says sharply. “You know how much we love Paul. We loved him even before you did, if you’ll recall. We aren’t standing our ground because we don’t want to get him back as soon as possible. We’re doing this because the price of cooperating with Conley is too high.”\n\nMy father adds, “Conley has his hooks into Paul already. That doesn’t mean we should hand you over too.”\n\nI close my eyes tightly until the wave of anger passes. “Dad—”\n\n“This discussion is over.” Mom heads toward the rainbow table. “If we’re going to save Paul, we need to get started.”\n\nDad follows her, as does Theo. But when Theo walks past me, our eyes meet, and I realize he knows what I’m thinking. I expect him to rat me out to my parents—that’s what the Triadverse’s Theo would do. Instead, he sits down at the table, pretending he doesn’t understand what’s about to happen.\n\nThey work until almost midnight. By that point I’m lying in bed, twisted up in the sheets, unable to sleep. All I can think about is the last time Paul and I were alone together before Theo collapsed—the last moment our lives seemed normal.\n\nWe lay together on the narrow twin bed in his dorm room, my head pillowed on his chest. Soft classical music played from his phone deck, almost covering the noise from other grad students down the hall. His dorm room is as stark as any other cheap student housing, plus Paul isn’t the kind of guy who would fix it up even if he had the money. He owns this utilitarian navy-blue bedspread, and there’s only one piece of decoration on the walls.\n\nHanging above us that night was my portrait of Paul. Not the one I’m painting now, but the first one I ever attempted. I cut it to ribbons when I thought Paul had betrayed us and killed my father. To my surprise, Paul insisted on keeping it just as it is. It reminds me how close I came to losing you, he said. That’s the kind of thing I’d want to forget, but that he always wants to remember. At least he let me patch it up.\n\nPaul stroked my hair, his fingers untangling my curls. It’s the gentlest, most comforting touch in the world. “I heard from a few more universities today, about my postdoc.”\n\nOne of the weird things about being a scientist is that you have to get multiple college degrees—and even after you get your PhD, you remain a student for another year or two, usually at a different college than the one you studied at before. The point of the whole postdoc thing? I have no idea. It’s a hoop they all have to jump through.\n\nIt would drive me crazy that Paul has to leave, if I weren’t headed to college myself in January. “Which ones?”\n\n“Oxford made an offer; so did Stanford. I expect to hear from Cambridge and CERN soon.”\n\nThis is information that would make most people jump for joy. Paul takes it in stride, but my stomach knots. “Nothing from Harvard or MIT? Or maybe Princeton?”\n\n“Not yet. MIT is a possibility, but—professors at Harvard and Princeton are skeptics.”\n\nAbout Mom and Dad’s work, he meant. Those are the professors trying to tear them down, the ones who don’t believe us about what happened in December. “Okay, so, we think about MIT.”\n\nHis gray eyes met mine. “It doesn’t matter where I go. I’ll still be yours.”\n\nI kissed him softly, enjoying the way we were tangled together, the soft sound of his jeans against mine as we shifted to get closer. “But I’d like it if you could be mine, like, every weekend. Not just at Christmas and spring break.”\n\nWhat with all the craziness of December, I’d deferred starting college until next January. The Rhode Island School of Design had agreed to that; they preserved my scholarship and everything. January is when Paul’s likely to start his postdoc. If he goes to MIT, we won’t be far apart at all.\n\nPaul said, “Are you still unwilling to apply to any schools besides RISD?”\n\n“RISD’s the best in the country for art restoration.”\n\n“What about fine art?” His thumb brushed along the line of my cheekbone. “Forget taking care of other people’s paintings. Create your own.”\n\n“See, this is how I know you’re a genius in physics but not economics. Ever heard the phrase ‘starving artist’?”\n\n“I doubt you would starve, as both your parents and I are gainfully employed.” Paul went from adorably literal to practical. “If you could study art anywhere in the world—to be an artist—where would you go? I’ve heard Josie tell you to think about the University of Chicago—”\n\n“Not Chicago.” The words came out too easily, for something so hard for me to admit. “I mean, that’s a great school, but if I could go anywhere? I’d pick the Ruskin School of Fine Art, at Oxford.”\n\n“Why Ruskin?”\n\n“They teach everything there.” I couldn’t keep the envy from my voice. “You study anatomy as in-depth as medical students do, so you understand what’s under the skin of the people you’re trying to paint or sculpt. They have professors who teach just about every technique, ancient or modern or experimental. They’re better than anyone.”\n\n“So go there,” said Paul the genius who has the world’s top physics departments fighting over him.\n\n“I’d never get in. Remember, I haven’t even been to high school, really.” The downside of homeschooling: Colleges find it tougher to evaluate you. RISD got with the program, but a foreign university would probably find my record harder to assess.\n\nPaul shook his head. “You’d get in when they saw your work. Oxford would admit you immediately.”\n\nWould they? We both glanced up at the shredded portrait of Paul; his eyes stare from the portrait as intensely as in real life. Yet I couldn’t imagine the professors at the single best art school in the world would understand this painting in the same way. “The important thing is getting you into the right postdoc. I know that. You’re doing groundbreaking research. I’m just painting.”\n\n“I’m just solving formulae. You’re creating works of art that might be meaningful long after my scientific work seems mundane.”\n\nI laughed. “Not likely.”\n\n“But possible. Your dreams are as important as anyone else’s. Your future is as important as mine. I’m willing to make compromises, if that’s what it takes for us to remain together—but we shouldn’t compromise before we even start.”\n\n“It’s different for me,” I said. “I’m not brilliant like the rest of you.”\n\n“You have no particular aptitude for science. But there are many kinds of intelligence. I’d never want to take your career as an artist away from you, any more than you would take my research from me.” Propping himself on one elbow, Paul looked down at me, almost grave. “Stop measuring yourself against us. It’s not the right scale. You have your own gifts, your own talents. Show the world everything you’re capable of, Marguerite. You don’t even see how amazing you are.”"

        "content": "There are moments when Paul’s awkwardness drops away and he suddenly says the exact right thing. Those moments make me feel like I’m melting—like we’re fusing together, ceasing to be two separate people, turning into one.\n\nThat night was one of those moments.\n\n“Hey,” I said, more softly. “Mom and Dad are going to that conference in Tokyo in a couple of weeks. You’re not traveling with them, right?”\n\n“We decided against it.”\n\n“Well, then, maybe”—my cheeks flushed with heat—“maybe you could stay over.”\n\nWe could be alone in the house. Nowhere near family members who know way the hell too much about my love life already. Instead, we’d be together with absolutely nothing between us, all night long.\n\nHe looked at me for a long moment, eyes darkening in a way I remember from that night in the dacha with Lieutenant Markov. Slowly, he nodded. “Okay.”\n\nI laughed softly, self-conscious. “It feels like we haven’t done this before.”\n\n“We haven’t. Well. Not here.”\n\nMy Paul was only a sliver of consciousness within Lieutenant Markov that night in the Russiaverse, because he was separated from his Firebird and unable to receive any reminders. But he was there throughout that entire night—so he remembers having sex as vividly as I do. I said, “Does it still count as our first time? Since it’s just our first time in this dimension?”\n\nHe brushed his lips against my temple. “I guess it does.”\n\nI slid atop him, my legs on either side of his hips. Paul’s hands caught me at my waist. When I leaned over him, my hair fell past my shoulders, and he shifted slightly beneath me, enjoying the feel of me above him. I couldn’t help imagining us just like this—without our clothes in the way.\n\nSmiling, I teased, “You realize this means we’re going to lose our virginity to each other . . . twice.”\n\nHe thought about that for a moment before he started to grin too. “Our lives are strange.”\n\n“Deeply weird,” I agreed, just before we kissed. Paul’s hands slipped beneath the hem of my shirt, slow and sure and hot.\n\nWe may not have spent the past months having sex, but that didn’t mean we hadn’t had fun. He knows how I kiss. I know how he touches me. We’ve learned each other inside and out.\n\nAnd now I have to lie here in bed in the middle of the night, alone and terrified for Paul’s soul—until I’m 100 percent sure my parents are asleep.\n\nBy 2:00 a.m., I feel pretty sure Mom and Dad have drifted off, no matter how worried they are. So I get up, tiptoe into the living room in my T-shirt and leggings, and find Theo waiting for me.\n\nHe’s sitting at the rainbow table, all three working Firebirds lying in front of him. “I’ve been double-checking each one to make sure they’re operating normally,” he says. Theo picks up the one I took along for my Medievalverse rescue attempt, studying the sheen of the light against its coppery surface. Softly he adds, “Part of Paul’s soul is in this thing. Gotta make sure it keeps ticking, right?”\n\nI nod. As worried as I am for Paul, as determined as I am to begin, I can’t help noticing how exhausted Theo looks. No doubt he told my parents he was going to bed right after them; instead, he sat up, waiting for me.\n\nThen again, maybe sleep is meaningless for him now. “Theo—what Conley said about the dreams—you really haven’t had any?”\n\nHe remains bowed over his work. “I haven’t remembered any dreams in a while. Doesn’t necessarily mean anything. I don’t remember them often.” His dexterous hands hesitate, and I can sense him weighing his words. “Thanks for making me part of the deal, by the way.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Telling Conley you wanted a cure for me.”\n\n“Paul’s the one who risked everything for you.”\n\n“And I intend to thank him too, once we’ve got him back. But right now, I’m thanking you.” The brighter light he’s aimed at the Firebird silhouettes Theo’s face, and the starker lines reveal that he’s lost weight. It’s not like I never noticed before, but I thought it was the usual grad-student grind. Now I realize Theo’s been fading away. “Sometimes I’ve wondered if you’d ever fully trust me again. Then you stood up for me. Put it all on the line. It was . . . Marguerite . . . you know, let’s stick with thanks.”\n\nI don’t know what to say, so I nod. His eyes meet mine, only for a moment, before he turns back to the Firebird, nods in satisfaction, and snaps it shut again. “They’re ready?” I ask.\n\n“Ready as they’re ever going to be.”\n\n“No point in waiting around until Mom and Dad wake up.” They’d stop me from doing this if they knew, even if it meant locking me in my room or smashing the Firebirds to gold dust. “I should go.”\n\nTheo says, “Correction. We should go.”\n\n“We?” I know I heard him right, but it takes a minute to wrap my head around it. “Conley didn’t say anything about you coming along.”\n\n“He didn’t say I had to stay home, either.” Theo’s grin is sharp enough to cut.\n\nI’m still in shock. “You said—you said you weren’t ever going to travel through the dimensions.”\n\n“That was before they kidnapped my little brother.”\n\nThe old nickname—and a reminder that Theo’s not doing this for me. He didn’t even mention saving his own life. Only Paul’s.\n\nYet I can’t help recalling what Theo said to me. Apparently, when I get a little bit of power, it goes to my head. He sees traveling as a temptation, and Theo’s not good at resisting temptation.\n\nStill, if he’s willing to take this chance for Paul, I have to be willing to take a chance on him.\n\n“All right,” I say. “Let’s go.”\n\nWe walk together to my room, where I’ve already posted a KEEP OUT note; my parents will understand the need to keep the room clear for Theo and me to return—if and when we can. I slide two of the Firebirds around my neck, mine and Paul’s; though I know it’s only my imagination, I can’t help thinking Paul’s feels heavier. I remember the Enlightenment scientists who tried to determine the weight of one soul. Now I could tell them.\n\nTheo takes the last Firebird in hand. He stares at it for a moment. Takes a deep breath. Then puts it around his neck—ready for the journey at last.\n\n“Okay?” I say to Theo.\n\nHis old bravado returns. “Let’s blow this Popsicle stand.”\n\nMy hand closes around my Firebird—the world falls away—\n\n—and I slam into my other self.\n\nThis time I’m in bed—definitely one of the better places to arrive in a new dimension. The room is dark, so I can’t really get a look at much. Mostly I just notice that I’m stark naked. Okay, whoever I am in this dimension, I sleep in the nude.\n\nExcept . . . I’m breathing hard. My skin is slightly sweaty. I feel faint scrapes along my throat and breasts and thighs—those could be from fingers, or teeth. And there’s a pleasant kind of soreness that tells me this Marguerite just had sex. As in, not even two minutes ago.\n\nI turn my head toward the naked man lying next to me—and see Theo."

        "content": "6\n\nI SCRAMBLE TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE BED, CLUTCHING THE sheet to my chest. This covers me—but pulls the edge away from Theo, who’s totally exposed, and totally nude.\n\n“Jesus!” Theo grabs a pillow to hold over his lap. “Aaaaand this is awkward.”\n\nMy cheeks flush hot. I try to look anywhere but at Theo, but every glance shows me something else I’d rather not see. My bra on the floor next to a pair of boots that must be his. A condom wrapper at the edge of the bed. An old-fashioned alarm clock on the bedside table, knocked onto its side next to a lamp with its shade askew.\n\nApparently what just happened here was . . . extremely energetic.\n\nFor a few long seconds, maybe a full minute, neither of us can speak another word. We can’t catch our breath, and besides, what could we possibly say? Would this moment be less cringe-worthy if Theo had never had feelings for me, and I’d never been curious about him?\n\nNope. Nothing makes this better. Nothing.\n\nI stammer out, “This—this has to be—this is the most embarrassing way to jump into a dimension. Ever.”\n\n“We could have jumped in about five minutes earlier.”\n\nWhen we still would have been— “Okay, that’s worse.”\n\n“Guess this version of me has better luck.” Then Theo goes quiet for a moment. “Sorry. Dumb joke.”\n\n“I don’t understand this.”\n\nWith a raised eyebrow, he says, “You don’t? Apparently I need to give Paul the sex talk again.”\n\nWait. Theo gave Paul a sex talk? I’ll deal with that later. “That’s not what I meant.”\n\nWhat I can’t understand is—how can Theo be in my bed? Paul and I have found each other in so many dimensions. The connection between us endures through all the worlds. Fate and mathematics bring us together, time after time. There’s no room in that equation for Theo.\n\nBut then I think of some of the first universes I traveled to. In the Londonverse, Paul and I both lived in England, but we’d never met. And in the dimensions where I lived on a deep sea station, Paul and my parents were both in oceanography but didn’t know one another. Even if there is a kind of destiny bringing me and Paul together, each world evolves at its own pace. We just haven’t found each other here yet.\n\nNone of that explains why I’m in bed with Theo. At this moment, though—with the two of us undressed and close and unsure—I can’t help remembering that one moment in London where I came this close to sleeping with him. (I mean, a version of him. I didn’t know the difference at the time.) The way I felt then is a lot like the way I feel now: embarrassed, vulnerable, and a tiny bit turned on.\n\nThe turned-on part is probably left over from the other Marguerite. It is. Has to be.\n\nTheo breaks the silence. “So. We ought to check the Firebirds, right? Make sure we went to the right place?”\n\nThey did, and he knows it; by now Paul and I have traveled enough to prove how they work. But testing the Firebirds is something to do besides freaking out about being stark naked in the same bed.\n\nWell, not entirely naked if you count the Firebirds; one hangs around Theo’s neck, two around mine. I tuck my sheet more firmly under my arms to keep it from falling, take one of the Firebirds in hand, then press the combination for a basic systems check.\n\nIt glows softly gold for a moment—the locator function at work—and my heart swells with stupid hope before I realize that it found Theo. Of course.\n\n“Looks like we’re in good shape, kid.” The gold light from Theo’s Firebird paints the side of his face for a moment longer before it goes out. He reaches up to run his hand through his hair, but it’s shorter here, practically a crew cut. “Listen—what’s a delicate way to put this—if you’ll excuse me, I kind of have to remove, uh, something worn by someone else.”\n\nIt takes me a minute to realize what he means. “Oh, ew.”\n\n“Tell me about it.”\n\nI cover my face with one hand. “I’m not looking.”\n\nThe first door Theo opens leads into a closet, but he finds the bathroom on the second try. He scoops up something from the floor—his clothing, I’m sure—and goes inside without another word. As soon as I hear the doorknob click, I scramble out of bed to find my own clothes. The stuff on the floor will have to do. Plain dark skirt, scratchy blouse—it’s all pretty utilitarian stuff. Doesn’t seem like the kind of thing I’d choose to wear, but right now I’d put on a Big Bird costume if I had to.\n\nOnce I’m dressed, I finally calm down enough to start really studying my surroundings. Is this my bedroom or Theo’s? I can’t tell from the decor alone, which makes Paul’s sub-basic dorm room look like it belongs on HGTV. There’s a pale blue blanket at the foot of the bed, no headboard, white walls, plain venetian blinds for the windows, and no art. This room is smaller than the one I have at home, but it doesn’t look anything like the graduate student dorms either. A small, unframed mirror hangs on one wall. I take a glance and realize that my hair’s shorter here, cut in a bob. At first I think that looks awful with my curls, but then I realize my hairstyle might have been neater before Theo and I . . . well, before.\n\nA soft rap on the bathroom door makes me smile despite everything; the poor guy has to knock to come back into the bedroom. Theo whispers, “Coast clear?”\n\n“Yeah. Come on.”\n\nHe steps out wearing what looks like a black coverall. He brushes his hands down the front, mock-modeling it. “Think I’m a mechanic in this universe? I mean, I like fixing up cars, but it never seemed like my ideal career choice.”\n\n“Doubt it, but who knows? We’ll have to figure things out as quickly as we can.”\n\nHe nods but doesn’t move. Hesitating isn’t like Theo. Then I remember that this is his first journey through the dimensions—the very first time he’s found himself in another world. When our eyes meet, he breathes out sharply. “Still getting used to this.”\n\n“You feel just the same,” I say. “Nothing changes, except you wake up someplace new.”\n\n“I don’t feel just the same. I feel better. Like, a lot better.”\n\nOf course. Only Theo’s consciousness traveled through the dimensions; that means he’s in this Theo’s body now. This body was never exposed to Nightthief, which means the damage Theo’s been suffering from for months now—here, it doesn’t exist.\n\nHe shakes his head, smiling at something that isn’t funny. “I didn’t realize how bad it had gotten until right this moment.”\n\nI put one hand on his shoulder. The touch is charged now in a way it wasn’t before, but I don’t care. Theo’s scared enough to let me see how freaked out he is, which means he needs some kind of comfort. Once he’s breathing more normally, I bring him back to the here and now. “You still remember yourself?”\n\n“Yeah. But I programmed a reminder every ten minutes for the next day. Seemed like a good first step.”\n\n“You’ll run down the charge.” Firebirds can operate for a long time; Mom made sure of that. But reminders require a lot of energy. You have to limit them.\n\n“I’ll set them further apart once I get my bearings. Let me get a handle on this first, you know?” Theo brings his hands together. “So, you’re the expert. Where do we start?”"

        "content": "“We start with this room, learn everything we can from it. That’s always the best way to begin, with your immediate surroundings.” It helps a little, Theo calling me the “expert.” That’s not exactly true, but at least now I’m thinking productively instead of standing here blushing. “Okay, the number one thing we ought to figure out is whether this is your room or mine.”\n\nTheo gestures toward the open closet door. Now that my eyes have adjusted to the darkness, I can see that plain dark dresses and skirts hang inside. He says, “Either this is your place, or in this universe I’m the world’s most boring drag queen.”\n\nThat makes me smile, and we’re at ease with each other again. I point at a dark square of leather on the floor. “That must be your wallet, right?”\n\n“Gotta be.” Theo kneels down to check it out.\n\nI steal a glance out the window to look around. Although there are few streetlights here, the moon overhead shines bright enough for me to see. This clearly isn’t our same house, but I think it’s still near the Bay Area—even in such a different neighborhood (smaller homes, fewer trees), the rolling ground is unmistakable. My bedroom is on the first floor of the house. Outside my window is a lone sweetshade tree; tethered to it, with a chain lock, is an old beater bicycle with fat tires.\n\n“Check this out,” Theo says as he gets to his feet. I turn around to look at the wallet he’s showing me. At first I don’t see what the big deal is—okay, so driver’s licenses look different here—and then I realize that’s not his license. It’s a military ID.\n\n“You joined the army?” That seems so . . . not Theo.\n\n“I was wondering why the hell I practically shaved my head. Now I know. But there’s more—”\n\nFrowning, I realize that Theo’s wallet is stuffed full of photos, all of them in black and white. I try to ignore the picture in front, a snapshot of me and Theo, the two of us standing with our arms around each other.\n\nHe continues, “We have black-and-white photography. We have a conspicuous lack of any smartphones or other modern tech here in your room. That means we’re in one of the worlds that hasn’t advanced as far, right?”\n\n“Normally, it would mean that,” I admit. “But Conley said he was sending me to dimensions where my parents were on the verge of inventing the Firebird.”\n\n“How can they do that if nobody’s even come up with color film yet?”\n\n“We’ll have to see. Every world develops in its own way.” I lean closer, trying to get a look at more of the images in his wallet. “Do you have a photo of Paul?”\n\n“Doesn’t look like it.”\n\nOf course I don’t know Paul in this universe, at least not yet. If I did, I wouldn’t be with Theo. We’ll have to figure out where he is in this world. It would be just like Conley to play a dirty trick and hide the next splinter of Paul’s soul in a dimension where we live in different cities, or countries, or continents.\n\nIt doesn’t matter. However far I have to go to rescue him, I will.\n\n“I can’t get over this,” Theo murmurs. “It’s so different but so not, all at the same time.”\n\n“Yeah, the changes can throw you off.”\n\n“Not as much as some of the stuff that hasn’t changed.”\n\nHe says it quietly, without looking at me, but for some reason I am suddenly, vividly aware of the mussed bed—still rumpled from when this Theo and this Marguerite made love. Theo wanted this for us. What must it feel like, for him, seeing that in one world we’re actually together?\n\nMaybe it’s painful. Or maybe he sees it as vindication. Proof that we could have worked out, if I hadn’t fallen for Paul instead.\n\nI turn away, meaning just to give us both some space for a moment. Then a dark shape on my dresser catches my eye—a picture frame that had tipped over, face forward. I try not to think about what Theo and I might have done against the dresser. Instead, I right the frame and breathe out in relief; Mom, Dad, and Josie all smile out from the picture, in black and white but recognizably themselves. The photograph looks recent enough that they’re probably all alive. I don’t take that for granted anymore\n\n“Come on,” I say. “Let’s check out the rest of the house.”\n\nWe tiptoe from my bedroom, down a hallway, until we reach the kitchen. This house is smaller than our home in Berkeley—one story, low ceilings—and way more boring. No philodendrons in terra-cotta pots; no wall covered in chalkboard paint; no suncatcher in the window. The kitchen has a stove, oven, and refrigerator, but they all look sort of clunky. On the wall hang an actual paper calendar, annotated in at least four different colors of ink, and an old-fashioned black plastic phone, complete with a long spiral cord.\n\nWhen I get closer to the calendar, I’m able to make out some of the entries, both the ones in Dad’s scrawl and Mom’s tiny block print. Josie flt demo 4/17. Presentation AF HQ 4/19. Marg shift change 4/20. None of this makes a lot of sense to me, but at least I know all of us live here together.\n\nNext we head into the living room. The furnishings are pretty bare-bones here too, but I smile when I see a pile of sketches on a small table. Even before I pick them up, I know they’re mine.\n\nIn the large majority of the dimensions we’ve visited so far, I’m still an artist—whether that means a professional, a student, or just an interested amateur. My love of creativity is one of my constants, a pole star amid the many constellations of possibilities and personalities that make up all the people I could be.\n\nBesides, I learn a lot from my art. Each Marguerite sees the world in a whole new way.\n\nThe first thing I notice: These sketches are on really awful paper. Not only is it cheaper stock than you’d get at an art store, it’s thin and coarse, not even printer-quality.\n\nNext, as I squint to examine the drawings in the dim light, I realize that these are all works in pencil only. Usually color is one of the most important aspects of my work, but a few of the other Marguerites stick to black and white. Slowly I flip through the drawings. While I don’t recognize some of the faces, others are more familiar. There’s Mom, with her curly hair drawn back into a severe bun. Josie, with her hair cut nearly as short as Theo’s. This is the only portrait I’ve seen of Josie in any world in which she wasn’t smiling. Dad, wearing wire-rimmed glasses that look like something from bygone days.\n\nAnd Theo. She’s drawn him perfectly, capturing both his intelligence and his mischief just in the expression of his eyes. The warmth she’s put into this sketch suggests that Theo’s stayed over before, and that their relationship isn’t some casual, careless thing.\n\n“Nice,” Theo says quietly. He’s looking over my shoulder at this other version of himself—a version who has a relationship with me that he never will.\n\nSo do I break Theo’s heart in this universe when I finally meet Paul?\n\nBecause Paul’s face is nowhere to be seen in these sketches.\n\nCarefully I put the drawings back in order and set them on the table. I walk to the window to look outside; the view is of the backyard, and I can make out a whole vegetable garden. That’s new. Mom loves her houseplants, but aside from a few pots with fresh herbs in the kitchen, she’s never bothered growing stuff for us to eat."

        "content": "Okay, great, you’ve learned that in this world you guys get your carrots from your own yard. I’m sure that’s exactly the information Wyatt Conley wants. You’ll have rescued Paul in no time.\n\nI take a deep breath and try to stay focused. Maybe Conley sent me to the wrong universe. Very dissimilar worlds are sometimes “mathematically similar”—so sometimes it takes a couple of tries to get where you want to go.\n\nThen Theo whispers, “Check it out.” I look over my shoulder and realize what’s sitting in the far corner of the room: a computer.\n\nA real computer, not some antiquated thing the size of a fridge with reels of tape and blinking lights. The slim black rectangle of the screen rests so deep in shadow that I didn’t see it before. It seems bizarrely out of place, but the main thing is that I now have a chance to learn a whole lot more about this world. To figure out if this is where I’m supposed to be or not. To look for Paul.\n\nI touch the screen, but nothing happens. Theo gives me a look before grabbing the mouse.\n\nOne click and the screen lights up. Instead of the usual folders over my dad’s Sergeant Pepper wallpaper, there’s a flat red-and-gray box with the header ARPANET. The cursor blinks at the front of a line asking for a password I don’t know. “Can you get into the system?”\n\nTheo nods. “Maybe, given time. I want a chance to check it out first; you only get so many tries before you’re locked out.”\n\nARPANET. I know that word, don’t I? Then I recall the grad student who taught Josie and me about the history of computing. The ARPANET was essentially the first version of the internet—a version that existed only for military use.\n\nSince when are my parents in the military? Them and Theo?\n\nThat’s when I see what’s hanging on one of the hooks by the door. I get to my feet, unable to believe what I’m seeing until I touch it and feel heavy rubber, thick plastic lenses. “What is that?” Theo says, not able to see past my shoulder.\n\n“It’s—a gas mask.”\n\n“Why do we need a gas mask?”\n\nThe puzzle pieces suddenly come together, the solution instantly taking shape in front of my eyes. The gas masks, the cheap paper, the vegetable garden—the fact that everybody I know seems to be in some version of the armed forces—\n\nA siren begins to shriek, so loud the vibration ought to shatter the windows. Both Theo and I clamp our hands over our ears. It doesn’t help much.\n\nTsunami alert, my mind supplies. Or wildfires, or maybe a tornado. That’s what sirens would mean at home.\n\nBut we’re not at home.\n\n“What the hell—” Theo starts to say, but then Dad dashes into the living room in his pajamas.\n\nInstead of asking why Theo’s here after midnight, particularly with both of us this rumpled, my father yells, “Come on! We’ve no time to waste!”\n\nMom runs behind him, a plain beige robe knotted over her nightgown. She goes for the desk and slides open a panel on the computer to withdraw the hard drive. “What are you two waiting for?” she says. “Move!”\n\nI start running after them, Theo only steps behind as we exit the house. Josie’s the last one out of the house, racing past us with a helmet under one arm. “I’m headed to the base!” she yells, racing for a small black car that must be ours. “I love you!”\n\n“We love you, too!” Dad says, looking back over his shoulder for only an instant.\n\nBy now dozens of people have joined us on the sidewalks, all of them running like hell. Parents hold their small children in their arms, to make better time; one little boy, maybe nine years old, clutches his kitten to his chest. Nobody has changed out of their nightclothes. Nobody has brought any physical object, except Mom and her hard drive. And everyone’s headed in the same direction.\n\n“What the hell is going on?” Theo yells, his voice almost lost in the shrieking of the sirens.\n\n“I’m not sure,” I say, “but I think—I think it’s an air raid.”\n\n“What?”\n\nThat’s when we hear the buzzing overheard. Thunder that is not thunder. Fire in the sky illuminates the clouds so that we can see the outlines of airplanes overhead.\n\nBombers.\n\nI realized as soon I saw the gas mask—this is a world at war.\n\n7\n\nI’M RUNNING AS FAST AS I CAN, BUT IT’S NOT FAST ENOUGH.\n\nShouts and even screams echo through the streets as we race toward whatever counts as safety. By now hundreds of people have joined the stampede. If I stumbled and fell right now, I’d get trampled to death.\n\nWorst of all, over the din, I can hear the distant thunder of bombs.\n\n“What do we do?” Theo yells.\n\n“Follow Mom and Dad!”\n\n“I mean—do we stay here? Do we leave? What?”\n\nHe’s hoping I’ll say we should leave this universe altogether, leap away and escape the consequences of the bombing. Go home.\n\nWhen I’m the reason one of my other selves is in trouble, I feel obligated to stay so they don’t have to face the consequences of my actions. Here, though, this Marguerite would be screwed no matter what. I didn’t endanger her in any way; this is just the reality of her world.\n\nBut if we leave this dimension without completing Wyatt Conley’s work—without retrieving this splinter of Paul’s soul—then Paul is lost to us forever, and Theo might die.\n\n“Keep going!” I shout back to him. “Hang on!”\n\nIf this gets bad enough, I’ll send Theo back to safety, and face whatever comes.\n\nThe sirens scream louder now, sound reverberating from every building until my ears hurt. I’d had a vague impression of this street as derelict, run-down; only now do I realize that these buildings haven’t fallen apart over time. They’ve been bombed.\n\n“Come on!” shouts a man standing at the door of what looks like a warehouse. He wears a bright red armband and a helmet, which I hope means he knows what he’s doing. “We’ve got to seal the doors in four minutes!”\n\nPeople press in desperately. Mom tries to reach for me, but the crush pulls us apart. Suddenly I’m wedged in among dozens of strangers in nightclothes, in regular outfits, even a few in their underwear; I’m not even facing forward anymore, being carried along by the tide of bodies around me. It’s hard to breathe. Gasping, I try to push myself toward the doors, only to get an elbow to the chin from someone who didn’t even realize I was there.\n\n“Hey!” Theo’s voice cuts through the shouts. I crane my neck to see him shouldering his way toward me. One of his arms hooks around my waist, so tightly not even this crowd can tear us apart. “You okay?”\n\n“Yeah.” Which is not even close to being true, not with bombers flying overhead, but thanks to Theo, I can at least stay upright.\n\nI shove myself forward and somehow manage to slip us through the doors. Then it’s a mad scramble down concrete steps, into a basement. Though the space is enormous, it’s crammed full of people—all of them breathing hard, sobbing, or both—and more are behind me. The only thing we can do is try to reach one of the walls so we won’t be knocked over.\n\nOnce my shoulder makes contact with one of the cinderblock walls, I take a deep breath. Stay calm. There’s nothing you can do now but hang on."

        "content": "“There.” Theo points farther down the wall, where my parents huddle together. Mom slumps against Dad when she sees us, as if she’s weak with relief. But this air raid hasn’t ended, so I don’t know what she’s so relieved about.\n\nJust that I got in, I guess. That I have a chance.\n\nI expect instructions on what to do, but in this situation there’s only one thing we can do: wait.\n\nWe all huddle together, catching our breath; a few people are still crying, and others are attempting to hush upset children. One man nearby is whispering a prayer. The outdoor chill of early-spring air has vanished in the heat of hundreds of bodies pressed too closely together. Theo still has his arm around my waist. I wonder if he’s trying to comfort me, or taking comfort himself.\n\nI’ve been afraid for my own life before. It’s terrible—a cold knot in your gut, your heart hammering at your ribs. Movies show people panicking and screaming like idiots. In reality, it’s nothing like that. When you fear for your life, you’re overcome by this ghastly clarity. You calculate your odds every instant. You invent options and see possibilities you wouldn’t have considered at any other time. You realize as never before that your life is the only thing that is absolutely, truly yours. There is strength within us that we can’t even comprehend until it’s called upon. We are, at our core, built to survive.\n\nWorse by far is being afraid for someone else. We can face our own risks with an unbelievable calmness. Risks to the people we love? They turn us stupid. Drive us mad. Fear and hope take turns telling us lies, each more improbable than the last. Our imagination kills the one we love in our mind, over and over again, and we have to witness. Yet somehow even that isn’t as unbearable as the foolishness of hope. It’s hope that makes us believe in miracles that haven’t come to pass. Hope that crushes us with the unbearable truth.\n\nNo danger I’ve faced torments me as much as knowing the people I love are in danger. Mom, Dad, Josie, and Theo—any one of them could be blown to shreds in front of me and there’s nothing I can do. And Paul, wherever he is in this world, is in the greatest danger of all.\n\nStanding here, waiting to find out if we’ll get blown to bits, is the most helpless, frustrating, frightening feeling in the world. Theo’s presence is my lone comfort, but even that only helps so much. After a couple of minutes, I can’t bear it anymore. Okay, so, use the time. Look around, and see what you can learn about this world.\n\nObserving the people around me doesn’t help much, because everyone’s upset, and nobody’s dressed normally. But I notice one old woman wearing a military jacket too big for her, something she must have grabbed on her way out the door. The flag stitched on the sleeve isn’t the American stars and stripes, or any other nation’s flag I’ve ever seen before. Apparently the geopolitical situation in this universe is dramatically different. I make a mental note to find a history book.\n\nI light up as I see that a man near me has tucked a newspaper into the pocket of his bathrobe. “May I look at that?” I ask him, pointing at the rolled newspaper. A few people stare; no doubt they think a bombing raid is a weird time to catch up on current events. But the guy hands me the paper, hardly even glancing away from the ceiling.\n\n“Good thinking,” Theo murmurs as I open it. “Let’s see what we’re dealing with here.”\n\nThe front page reads SAN DIEGO STANDS STRONG: SOUTHERN ALLIANCE REPELLED AT SAN YSIDRO MOUNTAINS. A grainy monochrome photograph shows the SoCal shoreline—but instead of the usual parasailers and beach umbrellas, dead soldiers lie on the sand. It’s so graphic that I can’t believe they would run it in a newspaper, period.\n\nBut I’m in a world where virtually every person is caught up in this war. Images like this have lost their power to shock.\n\nWhat the hell is the “Southern Alliance”? Theo gives me a look; I know he’s wondering just as much as I am, but that’s not the kind of question we can ask out loud without immediately tipping off everyone around us that something’s up. Flipping through pages turns up no answers. Of course not. Everyone here knows about the Southern Alliance. It’s too obvious a fact to print in newspapers; it would be like going onto the CNN home page to find a big article explaining what France is.\n\nThis newspaper is a lot more . . . news-focused than most of the ones I’ve seen. No sports section; no horoscopes. They do print movie listings, though, and I smile as I see an ad for some big melodramatic romance starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Keira Knightley. People tend to find their destiny, no matter what world they’re in.\n\nThat means Paul has to be a physicist, at least a scientist of some kind. Mom and Dad must have heard of him—or they’re going to. Maybe I could ask them to find out about him. What excuse can I come up with for that? I’ll think of something.\n\nWeirdly, there are articles about technology, about how the military is expanding its use of wireless internet, building drones for combat, and improving satellite navigation to better direct the troops. All of that sounds totally modern.\n\nTheo, reading the article over my shoulder, whispers, “So how come their phones are still connected to the wall?”\n\nThe same reason they have to grow their own vegetables, I suspect. The same reason eggs are rationed and paper is too thin. This war must require every person, every resource. They’ve made many of the same advances we have, but that technology is reserved for military use.\n\nMy parents have access to that; they’re doing Firebird research. Which means that in this world, my parents are doing the exact same thing Wyatt Conley is doing in ours: trying to find technology that will allow them to dominate. To control. To win.\n\nConley’s only doing it for profit, I think. My parents are probably just trying to keep their country from being destroyed. Big difference in motives.\n\nA deep boom shudders through the room, and several people moan in dismay. It wasn’t much of a shake, though—more like one of those earthquakes you hardly notice until it’s over. The planes aren’t too close to us. Yet.\n\nI try to imagine what’s happening out there. All the pictures in my mind come from bad movies or old World War II newsreels; none of them help me wrap my head around it. I only realize I’m shivering when Theo hugs me more tightly. Closing my eyes, I lean my forehead against his shoulder and take slow, deep breaths.\n\nAnother boom, louder and deeper. Cement dust falls from the ceiling and cinderblocks, and the impact jars us so much that some people fall down. Theo keeps us on our feet, but barely.\n\nWhere is Paul right now? What if he’s not a scientist? The Paul in this world might have to be a soldier, too. He could be in this same battle—his life in danger, even now.\n\nIf he’s killed with part of my Paul’s soul inside him, that splinter will be forever lost. I could never re-create his soul, reawaken him. It would be like he died too—\n\nIt’s less like I hear the explosion, more like the sound takes over the whole world. The floor convulses beneath our feet. I’m horizontal before I know it, one in a tangle of frantic, disoriented people. As I struggle to get up, towing Theo after me, water flows over my foot. A main must have broken. I imagine the entire room filling up, all of us struggling to swim and breathe the last inch of air.\n\nBut the water isn’t flowing that fast. Even though much of the crowd is still crying or screeching, I can tell the shelter remains more or less intact. That was a close one, but we’re okay for the moment."

        "content": "Theo gives me a look. “Are you sure we should stick around?”\n\n“We have to!” I whisper.\n\n“Marguerite, we can’t save Paul if we die here.”\n\n“Keep one hand on your Firebird. We don’t leave unless we absolutely have to. The absolute last second. All right?”\n\n“Yeah. Got it.”\n\nThen I hear the planes through the cement, from underground. The sound could only reach us if the bombers were directly overhead.\n\nI turn toward Theo; his eyes meet mine. He grips my hand tighter and says, “Just in case—I love you.”\n\nAnd the world turns white, and disappears.\n\nAll those movies you see, where action heroes coolly stroll away while buildings explode right behind them? They’re total crap.\n\nWhen something explodes near you, a wall of hot air hits you so hard it feels like stone. Your eardrums seem to shatter, like the bomb’s gone off in your head; you can’t hear anything but a dull roar, and a ringing. The explosion knocks you down, sears your skin.\n\nI manage to push myself up on my elbows, above most of the dazed people lying around me. Smoke lingers in the air, and I look up to see the exposed night sky, ringed by rubble that must have been the building we ran into before. Fire flickers up there, but nothing’s burning down here. My palms sting, scraped and bloody, but I don’t think I’m hurt worse than that. Next to me, Theo’s lying on his back, coughing so hard from the smoke that he clutches his gut. Nearby I see Mom sitting upright, shaking her head like she’s trying to clear the ringing from her ears. Dad brushes stone dust from his hair.\n\nAs the air clears slightly, I see the people on the other side of the room—torn skin, unnaturally bent limbs, and blood. So much blood.\n\n“We need help!” someone shouts. It’s not like I have any idea how to handle medical emergencies, but it’s impossible to look at this and not feel the need to do something. By the time I reach some of the injured, a few nurses and one doctor are already working to help, so I fall in with them and follow their lead. The next several minutes are a blur: ripping apart spare pieces of clothing to use as bandages, bracing people in whatever posture will allow them to protect their broken limbs and experience the least pain. One elderly woman seems to be having a heart episode, but with no drugs to give her and no ambulance to call, all I can do is sit by her side and talk her through it. “Deep, slow breaths. Try to calm down.”\n\nShe gives me a look like I am a total dumb-ass. Yeah, I get that “calm” isn’t really an option with bombers circling overhead. But we have to try.\n\nWhen she’s as settled as she can be, I look around to find Theo standing behind me. “Anything I can do?” he calls over the clamor and the crackling of flame overhead.\n\nSurely there is, but the way wounded and panicking people are crushed in here reminds me of a Hieronymus Bosch painting: nonsensical and grotesque. Who can tell what we should or shouldn’t do? “Just hang on.”\n\nThe air whistles as I hear another bomb fall. Theo and I look at each other in panic, and I clutch his hand. But the next impact is farther away. The one after that is even more distant. We begin to breathe a little easier, and the people around us visibly relax. Theo murmurs, “Does this mean we made it?”\n\n“I hope so.” Only then do I realize we’re still holding hands, and I let go. We don’t look each other in the eye.\n\nNear us, a little girl asks her mother, “Is it over?”\n\n“We’ll get the all-clear soon enough,” the woman says. “You wait and see.”\n\nFrom the weird glances she gets, I can tell not everyone is as optimistic as she is, but as long as I can’t hear bombs, I’m taking it as a positive sign.\n\nI keep offering what makeshift nursing I can, which isn’t much. Within the hour, a doctor who’s taken charge tells me to take it easy for a few moments. With a sigh, I lean back against the wall and slide my hands into my pockets.\n\nSomething’s in my left pocket. I pull it out to see that it’s a photograph, bottom up in my palm so that I see the back and the words written on it: With all my love forever.\n\nI turn the picture over to see Theo in full uniform, smiling up at me.\n\n“What’s that?” Theo says from his resting spot nearby. He hasn’t really glimpsed it; he’s just trying to make conversation.\n\n“Nothing.” I put the photo back in my pocket.\n\nWe don’t get the all-clear until hours later. By then my whole body is stiff, I’m starving, and the sunlight outside is so bright it feels like it could burn my eyes. I stumble around the street, squinting at the scene around us. Most of the neighborhood looks the same—except for the areas that have been instantly, totally obliterated. What were buildings are now smoldering holes in the earth. In the distance I can see smoke spiraling up from several new fires.\n\nThrough a megaphone, Red-Armband Guy shouts, “All commercial and manufacturing work is suspended for the day. Return to your homes and await further instructions.”\n\n“Thank goodness this happened at night, instead of during the day when you were at work,” Mom says as we walk home along the ruined streets. All around us, smoke darkens the dawn sky. “I wouldn’t like the thought of you at the munitions factory at a time like this.”\n\nMy job in this universe is building bombs? How am I supposed to bluff my way through that? At this moment, I can’t imagine anything I’d less want to do than make even one more bomb in this world.\n\nBuildings I saw only an hour ago now lie in pieces on the street, having crumbled into smoldering piles of brick and rebar. Most of those houses were empty, surely, because of the air-raid siren, but I can’t be sure. When I see a tricycle upside down in some rubble, I have to close my eyes tightly for a moment.\n\nAs the four of us reach our house—intact, untouched—Dad glances at Theo. “You know, Private Beck, during wartime, emotions run high. We live as if there’s no tomorrow. So we overlook things we normally wouldn’t, such as a young man sneaking out of our daughter’s room in the dead of night.”\n\nFor once, Theo is speechless.\n\nDad keeps going. “I myself am experiencing that sort of amnesia right now. I have no idea how you managed to find us in the bombing raid, since of course you were nowhere near Marguerite’s bedroom when this all began. However, I suspect your commanding officer will suffer no such memory lapse if you fail to appear on base shortly.”\n\n“Right. Yes. Of course.” Theo’s hand steals toward his pocket, and his wallet, which we have to hope contains the address of this military base he’s supposed to report to. “I’ll just, uh, get going. I’m gonna do that. Now.”\n\nMom smiles crookedly at him. “Don’t you need your bicycle?”\n\nTheo looks toward our house, and I glimpse the bike I saw last night. He sighs heavily, and I know he’s wishing for his Pontiac. “Yes, ma’am. Marguerite, I’ll be by later, okay?”\n\nMy only answer is a nod. I’m silenced by the memory of the last words he spoke before the bomb fell—what he wanted to say to me if those were our final moments alive. He smiles slightly, then turns to go.\n\nOnce we walk inside, Mom and Dad act like everything’s normal. For them, this is normal. My father volunteers to make breakfast, while my mother takes the first shower. I just sit at the kitchen table, unable to move or think. The smell of burning still stinks in my nose."

        "content": "After only a couple of minutes, I hear the door slam, and heavy boots tromping toward our kitchen. Dad breathes out a sigh of relief.\n\nJosie strides in, wearing her coverall, a grin on her face. “Hey, looks like we still have a house.”\n\n“Fortunately,” my dad says. “That’s handy, isn’t it? Otherwise I have no idea where I’d keep my shoes.”\n\nThey’re both pretending all our lives weren’t in danger during the raid; they have to. If they didn’t pretend, the fear would be too much to live with. I haven’t been here long enough to match their bravado, but I muster a smile for my sister.\n\nDad gets out a frying pan and spatula. “Genuine scrambled eggs coming up. Last ones for a while, too, so enjoy.”\n\n“Can’t we trade for some more ration cards?” Josie makes a face. “Reconstituted eggs are so awful.”\n\n“Don’t be greedy, Josephine. We receive more than most people as it is.” Mom comes into the kitchen, and there is nothing weirder than seeing her in a military blazer, skirt, and necktie.\n\nAs my parents hug each other, and the frying pan sizzles, Josie leans close to me and whispers, “Hey, Mom and Dad might be cutting you a break on the young-love-in-wartime thing, but could you and Theo watch the decibel level? I need my sleep.”\n\nOh, my God, my sister heard me having sex, no, no, no. “Sorry.”\n\nJosie’s already moved on. “You know what we need? Caffeine.”\n\n“Coming right up,” Dad says, placing mugs of something warm, brown, and steaming in front of us. But the smell is all wrong. Whatever he just gave me, it isn’t real coffee. When I take a sip, the stuff’s so bitter I have to force myself to swallow.\n\n“Maybe you should cut down on coffee, Marguerite,” Josie deadpans. “You don’t seem to be sleeping well lately.”\n\nMom comes to the rescue—deliberately or not, I don’t care. “Was it at least good flying this morning?”\n\n“Better believe it,” Josie says. As she keeps talking, I realize my sister isn’t just in the military. She’s a freaking fighter pilot.\n\nAt first that seems impossibly strange, but then it doesn’t. My big sister is the definition of a thrill seeker. Surfing, snowboarding, zip-lining—if you have to sign a liability waiver before you do it, Josie thinks it’s fun. No matter how much this dimension has changed, my sister still found a way to get her adrenaline rush.\n\n“I wish someone would call us about the lab,” Dad mutters as he works with the eggs.\n\n“Phone lines are probably down,” Mom points out. “They’ll send someone. Until then, it’s no use worrying about it.”\n\nShe always says that, back home. My dad answers like he always does: “I don’t worry because it’s useful. I worry because I can’t help it.”\n\nMom pats his shoulder. “Just eat breakfast.”\n\n“Come on, Dad.” I want him to stop talking about the war. I want him to sit down and make bad jokes over our meal, like he always does. It seemed so strange when they all first started pretending we’d never been in any danger, but now I wish they’d go back to it.\n\nThey don’t. “We’ve got to move forward,” Dad says as he puts my mom’s eggs on her plate. He’s talking to her, not me. “We could do more theoretical work, but if the Firebird project is ever going to help the war effort—we must build a prototype soon.”\n\nMom nods. “I know. We’ll have to start tomorrow. We’d be ordered to within the week in any case. I doubt the generals would be willing to wait any longer.”\n\n“You can do it, Sophie,” Dad says. “We’ll make this happen. It’s our last chance.”\n\nThat’s when it hits me. Conley sent me here to sabotage my parents’ work on the Firebirds. I can’t get Paul back any other way. I can’t cure Theo.\n\nBut if I steal that technology from my family in this dimension—I might be condemning them all to death.\n\nSomeone knocks on the door. “That will be someone from the lab,” Mom says.\n\nI get to my feet before she can. “I’ll get it.” Right now I just need to do something. Anything.\n\nOr so I believe, until I open the front door, and Paul is standing there.\n\n8\n\nPAUL SITS IN MY FAMILY’S LIVING ROOM, ON THE MOST uncomfortable chair. He took off his uniform hat when he walked inside, but otherwise he could have stepped right off a recruiting poster. The navy-blue jacket frames his broad shoulders; his trousers are sharply creased. Even his shoes shine. His posture is so rigidly straight I wonder if his back hurts.\n\nI want to run to him, use the reminder and capture this second splinter of Paul’s soul—halfway there! Almost done!—but I can’t. In this dimension, he and my parents know what Firebirds are; they’d understand what I was doing, and that I was from another universe. In other words, I’d be busted.\n\nThe warm rapport I’m used to between Mom, Dad, and Paul is absent now. Here, my parents appear to be his superior officers, no more.\n\n“What about our electron microscope?” Mom asks.\n\n“Minor damage,” Paul says. “Or damage that would be minor, if we could get the replacement parts more swiftly.”\n\nDad puts his head in his hands. “Bloody hell.”\n\n“It’s all right, Henry. We can still run the resonance test. But not here.” It’s weird, seeing my mother act so official, especially with Paul. “Lieutenant, is the San Francisco facility ready?”\n\nPaul nods. “Very nearly, ma’am. I could travel into the city tomorrow to personally supervise the modifications. Within five days or so, we’d be ready. A week at most.”\n\n“Then we should review the plans,” Mom says. “Normally we’d do this on base, but I trust you won’t object if we meet here today, Lieutenant Markov.”\n\nEven though this is an entirely different universe, an entirely different Paul, something in my heart still sings when I hear those two words: Lieutenant Markov.\n\nCouldn’t I reclaim this splinter of his soul? If Mom and Dad figured out what I was doing, would that be so terrible?\n\nYes, it would. My heart sinks, imagining my parents’ reaction. This is a world at war; I am an invader, one wearing their daughter’s skin. If they reported me to the authorities, I could wind up in a military prison. Regardless, once they knew I was a traveler from another dimension, I would have no chance to sabotage their work. If I can’t prove I did that when I go to Triad’s home office, Conley won’t give me the final coordinates, or the cure for Theo.\n\n“Of course not, ma’am. I’ll set up at this table.” Paul reaches for the stuff lying in front of him—my sketchpad, open to the portrait of Theo. He hesitates. “That is—if you wouldn’t mind, Miss Caine.”\n\nMiss Caine?\n\n“No, it’s fine.” I step forward to take my art supplies myself. My hand brushes against his, an accidental touch, but Paul reacts to it. His eyes search mine, hoping for meaning.\n\nThe look in his eyes is one I know. One it took me a long time to interpret. But once I understood him, I could never miss that look again.\n\nHe loves me. At the very least, he cares about me deeply. And obviously Paul and I have known each other for a long time in this dimension."

        "content": "So why is it still “Lieutenant Markov” and “Miss Caine”?\n\nMore than that—if Paul is here, in my life, why am I with Theo?\n\nOur home turns into a makeshift physics lab, which for me is nothing new. But my parents aren’t as warm and welcoming in this universe. Not that they’re unfriendly to Paul or anything; everyone is almost excruciatingly polite as they work. But the warmth my parents showed to Paul from the very beginning, the affection that led them to bake his birthday cake and buy him a decent winter coat—in this dimension, I see no sign of that. Maybe this is the difference between a university setting and the military. The professors who would befriend you in a graduate program have to keep their distance when they’re your superior officers.\n\nWhile they’re crunching numbers, I’m left with nothing to do. Word comes that the munitions factory where I work was destroyed in the air raid, which is an enormous relief. Me building bombs? That would’ve been a recipe for disaster. The way Dad tells me this, it’s obvious he expects me to receive another duty assignment soon. But “soon” is not “today,” so my day is my own.\n\nNormally, I spend any free time in a new dimension searching for background information. That means web pages or other, more sophisticated sources in universes that have developed that far; in universes not quite so far along, I turn to books. Mom and Dad almost always have plenty lying around, because they’re curious about everything from the ancient Incas to origami. In this world, however, it seems that paper is rationed as strictly as everything else. No encyclopedias or histories are to be had. My parents own only a handful of books, most of them novels. Even reading those might tell me something—but would I be able to figure out what’s true and what’s fiction in each one? So instead of obtaining vital facts for my mission, I wind up reading a Jane Austen novel called The Brothers. I don’t think we have that one in my universe, though, so at least that’s something.\n\nLate in the afternoon, as they’re taking a break for a fairly depressing snack of canned peaches, my mother draws me aside. “You’re not ill at ease, are you?”\n\n“Um, no?”\n\n“I realize how awkward the situation is for everyone involved,” Mom continues. “Lieutenant Markov is essential to our work, and we have to work at home today, so there’s no way around it.”\n\nShe seems to expect a response. “Okay.”\n\n“He’s handling his disappointment well, really. That’s all we can ask. I just hope it doesn’t put you in a difficult position.”\n\nIt sounds like Paul tried to get me to go out with him and I said no.\n\nWhy would I say no?\n\n“It’s all right,” I say to her. “Paul’s a good guy. I know he’ll always do the right thing in the end.”\n\nMom stares at me like I just told her ostriches orbit Pluto. Is it because I slipped up and called him Paul? After a moment, though, she nods. “Sometimes I forget how insightful you are.”\n\nI hug her, remembering the long weeks when I was trapped in dimensions where she was already dead. Traveling through the worlds gives you perspective. It makes you value what you have.\n\nJust at nightfall, while the ad hoc scientific conference is still under way, the doorbell chimes again. Dad answers before I can. “Why, Private Beck. I don’t think I’ve seen you in ages.”\n\n“Good evening, sir. Is Marguerite at home?” Theo catches sight of me and lights up like sunrise. He’s playing his role in this universe a little too well.\n\nStill, the roles have to be played. “Theo,” I say as I go to him. He pulls me into his arms, an embrace so fervent, so intimate, that I can’t deal with the fact that my parents are watching this. In Theo’s ears, I whisper, “That’s enough.”\n\n“For now,” he says in a low voice.\n\nThis isn’t my Theo.\n\nThe Theo from this universe—the one who’s been to bed with Marguerite, the one who loves her—that’s who’s holding me now.\n\nI manage to part us without actually shoving him against the wall. My parents studiously stare down at their equations. From his chair, Paul watches us, then ducks his head when he realizes I’ve seen him.\n\n“How did the telemetry systems fare in the raid, Private Beck?” My mother asks him this without ever looking up from her work.\n\n“Very well, Dr. Caine,” Theo says. Huh, so my parents got around to getting married in this universe. Good to know. “In the first rush—for a moment, it felt as though I didn’t even remember how I’d gotten back to base. Strange.”\n\nThat’s because my Theo was in charge during that trip; this Theo’s consciousness didn’t reclaim his body until afterward. He must have spaced out the reminders like I told him to.\n\n“We didn’t take too much damage,” Theo continues. “I’ve reviewed the entire system. We’ll be back to full capacity by tomorrow.”\n\n“Have you eaten dinner?” Mom says. She’s being a bit cool—probably because she remembers us running out of the house half-dressed last night. “I can’t offer you much beyond cheese on toast, because we’re at the low end of our rations. But it’s yours if you want it.”\n\n“I ate already. Just wanted to talk with Marguerite for a bit.”\n\nDad waves us off. “Fine. Go on out back.”\n\nOut back? Theo seems to know what this means, though; he takes my hand and leads us toward the rear of the house. As we go, Paul watches us, his gray eyes yearning—no. Hungry. Then he sees my mother looking at him, and returns his attention to the papers on the table.\n\nI love our back deck at home, with its silly tropical-fish lights and the yard that slopes so sharply you can’t even set up a lawn chair. I love the way it’s ringed by tall trees, making it seem as though our house in the Berkeley Hills isn’t crammed into an overpopulated neighborhood; instead, I feel like we’re cut off from the rest of the world, in a quiet, peaceful place of our own.\n\nIn this dimension? No such luck. We have no back deck, only the one tree. Instead, there’s a few inches of concrete that has to count as a patio, and one rickety bench. But from the way Theo pulls me down next to him on that bench, this must be our favorite place.\n\n“I missed you today,” he whispers, and he draws me close.\n\nMy whole body flushes, but I manage to hold him back. “Wait.”\n\nWhen I pull the Firebird from his uniform jacket, Theo stares. “What the hell is that?”\n\n“You’ll see,” I say, punching in the sequence that will activate a reminder.\n\nThe charge jolts him. Theo swears under his breath and pushes himself away from me. After a couple of deep breaths, his eyes go wide. He’s my Theo again. “Whoa.”\n\n“Are you all right?”\n\n“I was like—I was in my body, but I wasn’t. Like sleepwalking while you’re awake. That is the weirdest thing I have ever—ever—wow.” Theo shakes his head, as if trying to clear it. “How do you deal with this?”\n\n“It doesn’t happen to me,” I remind him. “I’m always in control, no matter what world I’m in.”\n\n“Nice work if you can get it.” Theo takes a deep breath, then refocuses. “What exactly happened inside?”"

        "content": "Since Theo’s not a perfect traveler, he doesn’t remember what happens during his journeys quite as clearly as I do. So maybe he’s forgotten the passionate embrace. Or he’s pretending to. Either way, I’m grateful. “Nothing much. You came to see me, Mom and Dad pretended you weren’t here this morning, and sent us out here.”\n\nTheo says, “That was Paul with your parents, right?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Why didn’t you go after him? Rescue that splinter of his soul?”\n\n“Because I have to be in contact with him to do that,” I say, blushing again. “Close contact. It’s not like I can tackle him in the middle of the living room.”\n\nTheo frowns. “What if that’s what it takes?”\n\n“Of course, if I have to, I will. But if I start acting weird before we get into Mom and Dad’s computer systems, they might figure out something is up.” I hook one finger around the two Firebird chains at my neck. “Remember, it’s hard for people from another dimension to see our Firebirds, but they can, particularly if they know to look for them. In this world, they know.”\n\n“Right, right. I’ve got it.” Theo hesitates, then says, “I thought—I figured you couldn’t know him yet, in this universe. Paul.”\n\n“Well, I do know him,” I say as lightly as I can.\n\nMy casual attitude doesn’t fool Theo for a minute. “Am I allowed to feel good about this?”\n\n“About what, exactly?”\n\nHis eyes are dark, unfathomable. “About the fact that there’s at least one world in the multiverse where you picked me.”\n\nI’m grateful for the darkness around us. Maybe that keeps him from seeing how flustered I am. “I—it’s like you guys always said. In an infinite multiverse, everything that can happen, does happen.”\n\n“So this—you and me—we were in the realm of possibility? Not sure how that makes me feel.” Theo stares up at the sky. Maybe lights are turned down, for fear of more bombers, because I can see every star above. “Probably you never even met Paul before today.”\n\nI ought to agree with him and move on. Instead, I tell the truth. “No, I know him. And he—he cares about me. I can tell.”\n\n“Poor bastard.” When I look at him, Theo shrugs, but he’s no better at faking casual than I am. “Being in love with a girl who doesn’t love you back? It sucks. I’d know.”\n\nThere’s nothing I can possibly say in reply.\n\n“I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy. So I definitely wouldn’t wish it on Paul.” Theo hesitates, then moves us along to a new subject. “Listen, when I was on base, I tried using the military computers to get at the Firebird data. No luck. Maybe that’s just because I’m not part of the project, but I figure your parents are as security-conscious as ever.”\n\nMom and Dad aren’t the type to use passwords like ABC123. For a while, my mom’s log-in code at home was the molar heat capacity of magnesium, and that’s just for her email. To get into a classified military project, they’re going to employ every barrier that exists. Still, I thought Theo’s familiarity with them would give us an edge. “You don’t think you can get through at all?”\n\n“If I had unobserved access to a terminal for long enough, probably, but in this universe, those are hard to come by. I can’t exactly hack into a military computer from a military base. I’d be arrested before I even hit Enter.”\n\nWhat are we going to do? We have to complete Conley’s errand if there’s any chance of saving Paul and Theo. The computer virus can do the work for us, but only if we can access the system the virus is designed to destroy.\n\nThe answer comes to me, and I turn to Theo. “We don’t try to get in through my parents. We get in through Paul.”\n\n“How exactly do we do that?”\n\n“He’s going to San Francisco tomorrow to set up the lab for a test of the Firebird components. If we go to San Francisco too, we could sabotage the new lab. Right?”\n\n“Maybe.” Theo still looks doubtful, though. “But why would Paul give us access?”\n\nI take a deep breath. “Because I’ll ask him to.”\n\nFor a few moments, neither of us speaks. Then he says, “You’d betray one Paul to save another.”\n\n“If I have to.” But when I hear Theo say it, my plan sounds so much harder. Crueler. “Besides, it gives me a chance to get . . . closer to him. So in the end I can rescue this splinter of Paul’s soul.”\n\n“Makes sense,” Theo says flatly.\n\n“I hate this, okay? I hate every minute of it. Probably Wyatt Conley thinks I don’t give a damn about my family in any other dimension, but this version of Dad is still Dad. This version of Mom is still Mom. Josie, Paul—if I do what Conley wants us to do, I might take away their last chance to win the war. But I have to. Getting close to Paul isn’t the worst thing I’m going to do in this dimension. It’s not even close.”\n\nTogether we stare into the distance, at the place where light streams through our window and paints squares on the scrubby grass. Even electricity is rationed here, so the night has become quiet and still. Instead of traffic noise, I hear only the wind through the trees.\n\nTheo speaks first. “I eavesdropped on as much war talk as I could today at the base. Apparently the situation doesn’t look good. We lost Mexico. Which I guess means this country had Mexico at some point, but, whatever. Supply lines from the Midwest have broken down.”\n\n“Is this like, if we lose the war, we have to rebuild? Like the Civil War?” Reconstruction and Jim Crow sucked hard, but even that sounds better than the alternative. “Or is this like, if we lose the war, Adolf Hitler rules the world?\n\n“The way the guys at the barracks talk, it sounds more Hitler-y. Still, it’s wartime. They could be exaggerating. Everybody hates the enemy, right?”\n\nWe have to hope.\n\n“Listen, we don’t have the power to permanently end your parents’ research, no matter what Conley says.” Theo takes my hand—for emphasis, probably, or simply for comfort, but I am vividly aware of his touch. “Say we manage to infect their project with the virus, screw up the computer system they have here—which is so tightly knit together, by the way, that taking the whole thing down would be a cinch. How long do you think it would take your parents to rebuild? A year, maybe? A little less?”\n\n“Do they have a year left?”\n\nFrom inside we hear the sound of Josie cackling, like she does at Dad’s awful jokes. If I do this, I’m betraying my sister, too. Guilt feels like a fist closing around me, squeezing tighter and tighter until I hardly remember how to breathe.\n\nI whisper, “If my Paul were here, I . . . I think he’d tell me to leave him and save them.”\n\n“If he were here, you’d tell him to shut up while you saved his ass.”\n\nDespite everything, I laugh. “Probably.”\n\n“Listen. This ‘cure’ for Nightthief exposure Conley’s talking about—even he admitted it might not work,” Theo says. “If you’re forcing yourself through this for me, don’t bother. But it’s not just about me. We have to get Paul back. That means we do whatever we have to do. Right?”"

        "content": "“Right,” I say, trying not to hear my family talking inside.\n\nTheo brightens, like everything’s all right, when it so obviously isn’t. He’s doing this to help Paul, and I feel a wave of unexpected tenderness for him. “Okay,” he says. “Now all we have to do is figure out how to get you to San Francisco.”\n\nWe pitch it as a romantic getaway, claiming Theo has leave. (Hopefully he can get it.) Until I’m assigned new war work, the destruction of the munitions factory means I’ve got some free time. So—why not San Francisco?\n\nBefore we talked to my parents, Theo had said, “Are you sure they’re going to say yes instead of taking a shotgun to my head?”\n\n“Dad’s not the shotgun type. Mom—maybe, but probably not.” Besides, I remember how they reacted when I told them Paul and I had fallen in love. Maybe Mom and Dad aren’t cozy with Theo in this universe, but they like him. They’re not prudes. They’re . . . realistic. “Anyway, if she were going to shoot you, she would’ve done it this morning.”\n\n“That isn’t half as comforting as you think it is.”\n\nBut asking your parents to let you go away for the weekend with the guy who’s been sneaking in and out of your room—no matter what universe you’re in, that does not go over well.\n\n“I can’t believe you’d ask us this,” Dad says as he paces the front room. “Not knowing what you know. Traveling down to San Francisco! It’s outrageous.”\n\nTheo and I dare a glance at each other. His expression says what I’m thinking: We screwed up.\n\nMom speaks for the first time since I asked her about the trip. “Henry, we’ve had no problems with the train lines this far north.”\n\nDad is not appeased. “Not yet. But at any moment—Didn’t today’s raid teach us anything? We don’t know when the next attack will be. We don’t get to know.”\n\nWait. He’s not freaked out by the thought of my staying in a hotel with Theo. Dad’s upset because I want to travel away from home, period.\n\nI venture, “Dad, the raid last night—we came this close to being blown away.”\n\nMom’s voice is sharp. “Don’t remind us.”\n\n“Don’t you see? We’re in danger everywhere. All the time. It’s not like I’m safer if I stay here.”\n\nAfter a moment, my mother nods, but Dad keeps pacing. “You remember what happened to your aunt Susannah. Everyone said the passenger ships were safe as long as they sailed under a neutral flag, but still—” His words choke off, and Mom takes his hand.\n\nAunt Susannah is dead.\n\nI can’t wrap my head around it at first. She’s my giddy, spoiled London aunt, who never seemed to care about much besides fashion and high society—but she loved all of us, and welcomed us whenever we visited Great Britain. One time when I was little, she took me to tea at some fancy hotel, and I felt so grown up. So special.\n\nThe last time I saw Aunt Susannah was in another dimension, the futuristic London where my parents had died during my childhood, and she had raised me. It was clear that she hadn’t done the best job at mothering; maternal instincts and Aunt Susannah don’t mix. But still, she took me in. She did her best.\n\nNow I have to imagine her on a ship on the ocean hit with torpedoes, sinking fast. She would have been so scared, and there would have been no hope of rescue. No escape.\n\nMom strokes Dad’s hand. “Marguerite is right. Safety is a luxury none of us have had in a long time, and may never have again.”\n\nHe doesn’t argue, exactly, just changes strategy. “She’s eighteen, and we’re sending her off with her boyfriend?”\n\n“We should live life to the fullest,” Mom says. We all hear the unspoken while we can.\n\nDad shrugs, and I know then that we’re more than halfway to a yes. My mother always wins in the end.\n\nTheo had been willing to lie about accompanying me to San Francisco, but it turns out he didn’t have to. He was up for leave, and his superior officers gave him three whole days off. As glad as I am not to have to do this alone, Theo’s presence complicates things in ways neither of us has to speak aloud.\n\nIt’s one thing to pretend to be a couple when we’re sitting on my parents’ sofa. Another to carry that pretense all the way to a hotel for the weekend.\n\n“I can’t believe they’re letting you do this,” Josie fumes as she drives me to the train station Friday morning. “Mom and Dad practically handed you condoms for the trip.”\n\n“It wasn’t that easy,” I protest. My small suitcase sits in my lap; it feels like it’s made of something not much sturdier than cardboard.\n\nJosie shrugs. “Well, there’s a war on.”\n\nWhich is pretty much what she said last night, when she let me borrow her one good dress—dark red, and made out of fabric soft enough to almost feel silky. For your romantic getaway, she’d said, and of course I couldn’t contradict her.\n\nThe train station buzzes with activity, but I glimpse Theo right away. When I wave to him, he jogs to us and—fulfilling his role—gives me a hug. “Hey. Was starting to think you’d ditched me.”\n\n“Never,” I say. I hope that sounds flirty enough.\n\n“Have a good time, you two,” Josie says. Already she’s turning to go. “Bang those hotel walls even louder than mine.”\n\nOh, my God. My cheeks feel like they’re on fire.\n\nTheo waves goodbye to her, then crooks his elbow. I slip my arm through it. Like a man and woman would if they wanted to touch each other every moment. Like we were in love.\n\n9\n\nFROM THE TRAIN WINDOWS, I FINALLY GET MY FIRST REAL look at the damage done to this battered world. The bombed-out neighborhoods I drove through the other day—the one I walked out of on shaking legs—that seemed like one terrible thing that happened in one devastated place. Even though I’d learned about the war, I still couldn’t envision what that truly meant.\n\nNow I don’t have to. The evidence spreads out on either side of the train.\n\nWe must live farther than I’d thought from the Berkeley I know, because our train ride lasts awhile. Then again, we’re moving very slowly, which gives me a chance to look around. Instead of the urban sprawl of my world’s Bay Area, we pass through only a few small towns, each one of which looks sadder and more broken-down than the last. Paint peels from buildings; litter lines the potholed streets; and nobody seems to be driving, or walking around, or doing much of anything. Mostly, though, the train travels through fields that look almost too abundant. Clover and weeds have grown as high as the train itself, sometimes higher. Vines have reclaimed what remains of old fences. Nobody has farmed or built or even mowed grass around here for a very long time.\n\nOften, in a new universe, I try to decide which artist would have been most likely to create a world like the one before me. This time, I can’t think of a single painter who would have created a world so gray and hopeless. Though maybe Andrew Wyeth could have captured this if he’d wanted to—nature and the countryside, but strangely haunted.\n\n“How long do you think this war has been going on?” Theo says, quietly enough not to attract attention from the other passengers in the train car.\n\n“Years. A decade? Maybe more.” Looking at the utter deadness around us—in what used to be some of the most expensive property in the entire country—I could believe the war has lasted an entire generation."

        "content": "Theo and I sit together like the lovers we’re supposed to be. The lovers we are, in this dimension. Most of the people around us wear dark, practical clothing like the cheap dress I’ve got on, though several men are in uniform like Theo. I take another look at him in his crisp, dark green uniform, complete with the folded cap on his head, and can’t resist a smile.\n\nHe smiles back. “What’s so funny?”\n\n“Your uniform. It’s not exactly a Lumineers T-shirt and a fedora, is it?”\n\n“You mock my fashion sense.” Theo puts one hand over his chest, pretending to have been shot through the heart. “But I for one happen to know I am stylin’. Well, usually. Not today.”\n\nAs innocently as I can, I say, “Aren’t most of the hipster guys growing beards now?”\n\nTheo makes a face. “Not me. I mean, I could maybe have a goatee or something sometime. But the beards you see right now? Halfway to Amish.”\n\nI laugh out loud. Several other passengers turn to look at us, but instead of looking annoyed, most of them smile. Maybe people have a soft spot for wartime romance.\n\nIf Theo notices, he shows no sign. “Listen, I meant to wait until we got to San Francisco, but it looks like that’s going to take longer than I thought.”\n\nNo timetables were given at the train station. Apparently you’re supposed to count yourself lucky if you even reach your destination. “Wait for what?”\n\n“To go over the files I pulled.” From his rucksack Theo tugs a manila folder, which is thick with more dot-matrix printer paper.\n\n“I thought you said you couldn’t get through the security,” I say, leaning closer.\n\nTheo replies, “I couldn’t get through to the classified stuff, no. But more general information? Not a problem.”\n\nAs soon as he opens the folder, my eyes find the name on the top sheet: LIEUTENANT PAUL MARKOV.\n\n“So here we have Paul’s assignment, his service record—which is golden, by the way—and even his address in San Francisco.” Theo frowned down at the paper. “Military Housing, it says. I get the impression that’s somewhere between a barracks and an apartment.”\n\n“Do we have his phone number there?”\n\n“Yeah. At his office on base too. So you’ll be able to reach him one way or another.” Then Theo sucks in a breath, and his hand tightens around the folder until the cover crumples. “Dammit.”\n\n“What?”\n\nHe points at a name on another page, one he just pulled out. It’s in small print, in one entry like all the others, but as soon as I see it the world turns cold.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Wyatt Conley.\n\n“What is he doing here?” I say, but the answer comes to me immediately. He’s doing the same thing he always does: inventing the latest technology and marketing it to whoever will pay the most to get it. In this world, that’s the military.\n\nOnce, in the Londonverse, I heard Conley give a speech about how war evolved over the centuries. He said then that the next weapons and strategies would go beyond anything history had ever seen.\n\nAs strange as this war is to me, I don’t get the sense that it’s so incredibly different from the ways wars have been fought before. Conley doesn’t have the technology he needs here to do what he wants to do.\n\nThen it hits me. “He’s connected to the Firebird project, isn’t he? But—he can’t be. If so, he wouldn’t need me. He could sabotage the Firebirds himself.”\n\n“He’s requested transfer to the project multiple times. Always been turned down.” Theo keeps scanning the files. “Conley and Paul have worked together on some other projects, though. Now he’s trying to get Paul transferred over to his department, but no success so far.”\n\n“Do you think that’s this dimension’s Conley trying to get control over Paul? Or our Conley trying to screw things up and failing?”\n\n“My guess? Both. But our Conley gave up, which is why we got this all-expenses-paid vacation in paradise.” Theo makes a gesture like Look at these amazing prizes, and finally I can smile again.\n\nAt this point I notice an older man looking toward us with a puzzled frown. I whisper, “Remember, watch our volume control as long as we’re talking about dimensions.”\n\nTheo swears under his breath. “I keep forgetting how quiet it is here.”\n\nNobody’s music is wafting over from earbuds. Relatively few people seem to chat with each other. There’s no ambient noise of cars or city life from the world outside. Just the thrumming of the tracks beneath the train, the occasional crinkle of folded newspaper, and Theo and me.\n\nMore quietly, he continues, “So what’s our plan here?”\n\n“We get to Paul, and I find out what I can.” Already I’m counting the minutes until I can be alone with him again. “I could suggest dropping by the lab for a tour, and—I guess that’s a place to start.”\n\nTheo frowns. “Not much of a plan there.”\n\n“It could work,” I retort. Theo’s already loaded the virus onto this dimension’s version of a hard drive. All I’d have to do would be plug it into the right port—and once I was in their lab, I think I could figure out what that is.\n\n“It could,” he concedes, “but we can’t afford to count on that. The project is classified. You might not be allowed in regardless of who your parents are.”\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, Theo’s right. “What else should I do?”\n\n“For starters, try to swipe his keys. His wallet too, if you can get it, or even just take a look inside. Since you’re Sophia and Henry’s kid, you can probably get him talking about the Firebirds without too much trouble. Find out how to get access to the computer system, and with this handy virus, we can take it from there. We’ll have screwed this whole world over before you know it.”\n\nOur conversation has become so tactical. So—cold. “You sound happy about it,” I snap. “Could you cut it out?”\n\n“Hey,” he says, more softly. “I know it’s hard doing this to your parents. I love them too, you know. Just like you and I both love Paul. That’s why we’re here. If we have to choose between a version in another dimension and our version—there’s only one choice we can make. Right?”\n\n“You think they’re totally different,” I say, “but they’re not. Mom is my mom, everywhere. Paul is Paul, everywhere.”\n\n“And I’m the homicidal psycho from Triad everywhere?”\n\nThat stings. “No. I didn’t mean—they’re not identical. But they’re not as separate as you’re pretending they are.”\n\n“If the pretense helps us get the job done, then I’m going to keep on pretending my heart out. Because that cure for Nightthief exposure—I need it, and soon. Are you with me?”\n\n“I’m with you.” I mean it, but saying the words still hurts.\n\n“Don’t listen to me, okay? Sometimes I snark about stuff because—you know. It’s easier.” Theo clearly sees that I’m still affected, but he doesn’t press further. “Okay. You go meet Paul. You learn everything you can. You bring me keys or a pass to his lab. I can take it from there.”\n\n“You?”"

        "content": "“Don’t act so surprised. This might be my first long-distance trip, but I think I’m getting the swing of it. Of course, I had to cut way down on the reminders—you were right about the charge, and also, damn do reminders hurt.” His smile is crooked. “What did you think I was here for? Just to provide an excuse for you to get on that train?”\n\n“Moral support, I guess.”\n\nIt’s his turn to laugh. “Immoral support, more like.”\n\nHow can Theo make me smile even when the situation is so grim? Somehow he always does.\n\nThen he adds, “Besides, like you said, while you’re nabbing Paul’s stuff—you’ll be close to him. You’ll have your chance to rescue that splinter of his soul.”\n\nThe thought of being close to Paul—both this world’s Paul and my own—sends a shiver through me. But I don’t lose focus. If I act too early, Paul will catch on. We have to complete our terrible mission here before I have my chance at Paul. “Not until the very end.”\n\n“Two rooms? What’s a guy with a pretty girl want with two hotel rooms?” says the desk clerk.\n\nWith a straight face, Theo replies, “I’ll have you know I’m a gentleman, sir.”\n\nThe guy gives him a look. “You know how many refugees from SoCal we’ve had coming through here the past couple of weeks? You’re lucky I’ve even got one room available. Nobody else is going to have many vacancies either. Take this one, and you can be a gentleman on the floor.”\n\nAs we silently ride up in the elevator, Theo holds our suitcases. I hold the hotel key—old-fashioned, metal with an aquamarine plastic tag dangling by a chain. Finally Theo says, “The floor’s fine. Really.”\n\n“We can take shifts. Four hours bed, four hours floor.”\n\n“That works too.”\n\nThe problem is, there’s not even a lot of floor in this hotel room, which is the smallest I’ve ever seen. Although I guess this is technically a double bed, it’s narrower than most, and yet it covers almost the entire length of the room. We barely have room to slip inside, stash our suitcases in a closet almost too shallow to hold them, and to open the door to a bathroom not much bigger than the closet. The carpet is beige industrial stuff, and the paint on the yellowing walls is chipped.\n\n“Well, it ain’t the Ritz.” Theo sits down heavily on the bed, then frowns. “Wait. Where’s the phone?”\n\nTurns out this hotel has only one phone per floor. If you want to make a call, you have to wait in line to step inside the “phone booth”—actually just a cubby with a little bench. The guy in front of me has a ten-minute argument with a woman (wife or girlfriend, I can’t tell) who apparently feels like he doesn’t make enough time for the two of them. I hear enough of the conversation to agree with her, but nobody’s asking me.\n\nFinally he slams down the receiver and stalks off. The phone is mine. For a moment I sit there, staring at the printout with Paul’s number on it, wondering how I go through with this.\n\nThen I read the title again: Lieutenant Markov. And I dial.\n\nThree rings, and—“Markov.”\n\nPaul’s voice feels like rain after a drought. Just hearing him makes my throat tighten. I manage to say, “Lieutenant Markov? This is Marguerite Caine.”\n\n“Miss Caine?” He sounds like he thinks this might be some kind of prank.\n\n“Yeah. Hi. I—I hope it’s okay that I called.”\n\n“Of course. Has something happened to the Doctors Caine?”\n\n“No, no, they’re fine! I was calling because, well, I’m in San Francisco, and I’m on my own. So I thought maybe we could meet up.”\n\nAfter a brief pause, Paul says, “You came to San Francisco by yourself?”\n\n“No. I came here with Theo.” Do I sound angry? I’m trying. “But he got upset because I—well, he stormed off. So now I’m all alone in the city for a couple of days.”\n\n“Private Beck left you on your own?” At least one of us is genuinely angry.\n\n“I’m all right!” I feel the need to make excuses for Theo, even after an argument that’s totally imaginary. “I’ve got a hotel room, and my suitcase, and a ticket back home in three days. But until then—well—I could use some company.”\n\nThe silence that follows stretches so long I start to wonder if we lost our connection. Finally Paul says, “Would you allow me to take you to dinner?”\n\nHe speaks so formally, sounds so unsure. I’m reminded of Lieutenant Markov, and the way he loved the Grand Duchess Margarita for so long without ever saying a word. I can feel my smile like sunlight on my face. “I’d love that.”\n\nNext up in this dimension’s never-ending parade of awkward: getting ready for my hot date with Paul while Theo is in the same room.\n\nTechnically I get dressed in the bathroom, but he’s right outside the door, critiquing the other elements of my outfit. “Your shoes are awful,” he calls as I struggle with my zipper. “These are hug-me pumps at best.”\n\n“I’m not going out to seduce him.” Paul and I never discussed whether getting together with other-dimensional versions of ourselves would count as cheating. Our relationship issues are not like most people’s. “I just need him to be, you know, flattered that I’m paying him attention.”\n\n“Trust me,” Theo says, more quietly. “He’s gonna melt the minute he sees you.”\n\nI pretend I can’t hear him. Instead, I finally conquer the zipper, then step as far back as I can to look at myself in the small mirror.\n\nJosie’s slightly shorter than I am, and her boobs are way better. But the way this dress is cut, the differences in our sizes don’t matter. The neckline cascades in soft folds, Grecian-style, then flows freely down to slightly past my knees. Although the dress has no sleeves, some of the red fabric drapes over my shoulders almost to the elbow. It doesn’t show much skin at the neck or arms or legs, and the fabric remains cheap, but the overall effect is undeniably sexy.\n\nMy short hair makes me wince. If I could tie it up in a messy bun, that would look perfect. Instead, I work with the bob as best I can, pulling one side back with a shiny metal clip.\n\nLipstick here is almost always worn dark red. The shade matches the dress, so I’m happy with it. I have no jewelry besides the Firebirds, tucked beneath my neckline so that only a hint of the gold chains shows at my throat. I fluff my hair again, step out of the bathroom, and smile. “How do I look?”\n\nTheo just stops. He stares at me like he can’t move, or maybe even breathe. His expression reminds me of the picture I found in this Marguerite’s pocket.\n\nI think maybe the tiny bathroom mirror didn’t do justice to this dress.\n\nThen Theo snaps out of it. “You look smashing, my dear.”\n\n“Very British of you.” Stupid joke. I have to joke, distract him, do something to break the tension between us.\n\n“Should I say ravishing? Gorgeous? How about lovely? Lovely works.”\n\nI manage to smile. “Thank you.”\n\nWhen I step into the shoes, I wobble—heels aren’t my thing. Theo leans close, so that I can brace my hand against his shoulder. Once I’ve got them on, though, he doesn’t move back. I don’t take my hand away, either."

        "content": "“You know . . .” His voice trails off.\n\n“What?”\n\nTheo shakes his head. “Better left unsaid.”\n\nNormally I would let him get away with that. Tonight I don’t. “Tell me.”\n\nHis eyes meet mine. “I’m in this extremely weird position where I’m jealous of myself.”\n\nIt’s hard not to look away, but I don’t. Remembering London, I admit, “We came close enough before.”\n\n“But that wasn’t me either!” Theo starts laughing, and I can’t help but smile. “Do you think we’re serious? This Theo and this Marguerite? Or is this just, you know, seize the day, seize the girl, because tomorrow never knows?”\n\nAt first I think I won’t even be able to say the words, but Theo deserves this much of the truth. “We’re in love.”\n\n“You think so?”\n\n“I know.” I fold my arms in front of my chest, one tiny barrier between me and Theo as he stands so very close. “During the air raid, I found a picture of you in my pocket. You wrote on the back, ‘with all my love.’”\n\nActually he said something about eternal love, but maybe I can leave that part out.\n\n“I can believe that,” he says evenly. “Doesn’t mean the feeling’s mutual, though.”\n\n“It is. I found my drawings of you. The way I sketched your face . . .” I switch out of first person. “She loves the Theo from this dimension. Deeply. Completely.”\n\n“Lucky guy.”\n\nWhen our eyes meet again, we’re both listening to the words we haven’t said. Even though I don’t feel the same way Theo does, he’s important to me—and apparently there was more potential between us than I ever realized. He wasn’t wrong to fall for me. Just in the wrong universe.\n\nI summon the courage to say, “In the bomb shelter—right before the blast—”\n\n“I said the kind of thing people say when they think they’ll never have another chance,” Theo says. “Let it go, okay?”\n\nI should. I will. Just as soon as I figure out how.\n\n10\n\nNO TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID. NO COLUMBUS TOWER. Either Ghirardelli Square was bombed to oblivion a while ago or they never built it in the first place. People walking by me on the street seem quieter, more furtive, less themselves—it’s like I’m surrounded by the same hundred black coats with changing faces. This isn’t the San Francisco I remember.\n\nSomething of the city’s spirit survives, though. I’m able to take a cable car part of the way, and the place where Paul asked me to meet him is in the neighborhood still known as Chinatown.\n\nI stand on the corner, my long dark coat pulled tightly around me. The temperature turned colder today—winter’s last futile howl against spring. I wonder if weather conditions are the same in alternate dimensions, if at home Mom and Dad have pulled their sweaters back out of the closet. Or maybe the “butterfly effect” holds up, and the tiniest possible changes in each world create new climates, new storms.\n\nMeanwhile, Theo’s stuck in our hotel room, waiting for me to come back and tell him all about flirting with Paul.\n\nI keep remembering that picture I found in my pocket, and what was written on the back. Theo and the other Marguerite love each other so much here. I guess—I guess I fell in love with him before I even met Paul.\n\nThe strange part isn’t that I’m with Theo. To myself I can admit that I understand how I could fall for him, with his sense of humor, devilish eyes, and the kind of full lips most girls would kill for. Despite the darker side of his character I’m still coming to terms with, Theo has a lot to give.\n\nThe strange part is that I didn’t fall for Paul.\n\nThis Paul’s love for me might as well be tattooed on his skin. Anyone near him can see it, no matter how hard he works to remain at a polite distance, to show me no more attention than he should. But he’s always paying attention to the details and emotions other people miss. Paul sees the real me in ways no one else ever has.\n\nDid this Marguerite just not understand how much he cares?\n\nI tamp down my frustration. You didn’t understand him either at first, remember? It took you nearly a year to realize who Paul really is. This Marguerite got involved with someone else first. So it’s going to take her longer. But she’ll get it eventually—won’t she?\n\nThe question, I guess, is how much this Marguerite loves Theo.\n\nIf our souls are the same in world after world, then Theo must in some fundamental way be the same person as the one from the Triadverse who betrayed us all. I’ve fought hard not to measure my Theo by the actions of another, but that silent judgment has lurked in the back of my mind.\n\nYet he stayed silent about his own pain. Came on this dangerous journey, breaking his own resolution never to travel between the worlds. Helped me come to San Francisco and set up a date with another man. The Theo from the Triadverse—I can’t imagine him being so brave. But, of course, we’re not only here to save Paul; we’re also after the cure for Nightthief. So far I have no idea whether this world’s Theo is more like the one from the Triadverse or more like mine.\n\nAt that very moment, amid the dull, faceless crowd, I glimpse Paul.\n\nHis uniform is different from Theo’s or even the one he wore to our house the other day: crisper, all in spotless white, except for navy and gold stripes at the sleeves—an officer’s insignia. The hat he wears has a brim and a small flag on the front. He could almost have stepped out of the 1940s.\n\nIt’s like Paul was built to wear uniforms. I remember how he looked in Russia, when he was a soldier and my guard.\n\nWhich makes it even sweeter to lift my hand and wave.\n\nHe stops short. “Oh, Miss Caine. I didn’t expect you to be—” Dressed up, maybe. Or smiling. But Paul says only, “—here so soon.”\n\nThis is the time we chose, almost to the minute; he’s punctual in a scary, inner-atomic-clock way. I let it slide. “Hey, let’s make a deal. If you’ll call me Marguerite, I’ll call you Paul.”\n\nIt takes him a moment to say, “All right. Marguerite.”\n\n“All right, Paul.”\n\n“Well,” he says, then doesn’t seem to be able to come up with anything else right away. I stifle a smile; Paul’s as awkward in this dimension as he is in mine. “So. Dinner. I made reservations.”\n\n“Wonderful.” He must be taking me someplace special.\n\nThen he adds, “Very few places are able to cook well with the new ration standards. This is an exception.”\n\nRestaurants that have to feed you off a ration card? I remember the dismal meals at home—cheese on toast, canned peaches, eggs that are not real eggs—and lower my expectations.\n\nApparently cheesy Chinese-restaurant decor has the power to travel through dimensions unchanged. Red-and-gold fans unfold across the walls, and small paper lanterns dangle in the corners. They’re all a little faded, like nobody’s replaced them with new ones in a long time, but they still add color to the room. Paul and I are seated in a curved booth just beneath one of the lanterns. The setting is perfect—intimate, so I can ignore the noise and activity around us and just be with him.\n\nAnd betray him, whispers Theo’s voice in my memory.\n\n“At first I didn’t understand why you weren’t working at the munitions plant,” Paul says, instead of normal human conversation like what happened with Theo or how was your trip. “But it was destroyed in the air raid. I’d forgotten.”"

        "content": "“I’ll get another duty assignment soon, but not yet,” I say, which is probably the truth. Mom and Dad would have told me if I were going AWOL.\n\nPaul nods. “I heard the younger workers were on shift. The thirteen- and fourteen-year-olds. It’s terrible.” A lot of people say stuff like that about tragedies only because they think they’re supposed to, but Paul closes his eyes briefly after he speaks. Like it hurts to remember it.\n\nWhen I think about a bunch of middle-school kids blown to bits in a factory already filled with explosives, my heart hurts too.\n\nAlso—kids as young as thirteen are working in factories? The war has already closed the schools, then. This dimension—at least, this nation, the one containing my family and friends and everyone I love—it’s even closer to the brink than I realized.\n\nYou’re the one who’s going to push them over the edge, I remind myself. My parents believe the Firebird project is their last hope; my job here is to take that hope away.\n\nI hate Conley for making me do this. I hate myself for doing it.\n\nBut as I sit here, looking across the table at Paul, I remember that a splinter of my Paul’s soul is trapped within. Lost and utterly alone, in a world he can’t escape. For him, I think I could do anything. Even this.\n\n“I’m glad you phoned today. It gives us a chance to talk.” He takes a deep breath, obviously gearing himself up to say something he’s planned. “When I spoke to you a few months ago—if I made things difficult between us, I’m sorry.”\n\nCan I forgive Paul before I know what I’m forgiving him for? I try, “What were you thinking?”\n\nPaul’s hands twist the napkin across his lap. “My father always told me not to let anything get between me and something I truly wanted.”\n\nI blink. That sounds . . . encouraging. Always before, I’ve had the impression that Paul’s father was anything but supportive.\n\nHe continues, “So I thought I would ask you out, regardless of what your parents might think or—or whether you were already dating someone. I misunderstood the depth of the commitment between you and Private Beck. If I had realized, I would never have said anything. Please forgive me.”\n\nI can picture the entire scene: Paul standing in front of me, probably scrunching his cap in his hands the way he’s twisting that napkin now. Me, so addled with love or lust for Theo that I couldn’t see the good man standing right in front of me. The depth of what he felt went unnoticed, unreturned. My heart breaks for him a little. At least I can give him tonight.\n\n“It’s okay,” I say. “Really.”\n\n“Oh. Good. I’d thought—well, I’d been afraid you weren’t at ease with me anymore. Even intimidated.”\n\nPaul’s an intimidating man: his size and his rugged features make him look more like a firefighter or a SWAT team member than a scientist. I’ve seen people glance at him when we’re walking around Oakland after dark. In shadow, he looks like someone who could take you down in about five seconds. Yet I’ve seen how gentle he can be, and the memory makes me smile. “You’ve proved you’re not the big scary guy I thought you were.”\n\nHe looks skyward, like he wants to laugh but can’t. “Big scary guy,” he repeats.\n\n“Nope. That’s not you.”\n\n“Glad to hear it.” That’s as close as Paul can come to banter. He’s so endearingly unsure of himself that it reminds me of my own Paul. The pain of missing him mingles with the strange delight of being with this world’s Paul Markov, and suddenly it’s hard to remember where one ends and the other begins. Is that glimmer of my Paul’s soul at work here, drawing us closer together? “I hope your parents aren’t upset with me. They might have seen my behavior as disrespect.”\n\n“Of course not. My parents know you’re okay. They wouldn’t work with you otherwise.”\n\n“We all have our duty.”\n\n“It’s not just duty. Mom and Dad think you’re brilliant,” I say. It’s the truth in my world, and probably in this one as well. “She even calls you a genius. Which for most people just means, ‘someone really smart,’ but you know Mom. When she says genius, she means it.”\n\nGenius isn’t just intelligence, she explained to me once. It’s the ability to see further than anyone around you, to put together different concepts in a way no one else has imagined. Genius implies originality and independence. It’s her highest compliment, and Paul’s the only one of her students I’ve ever heard her describe that way.\n\nPaul ducks his head. But I can see his small, almost disbelieving smile. “That’s good to hear.”\n\n“Tell me about San Francisco,” I say. The file Theo found listed Paul as having military housing here in the city; he must only visit the base in my hometown from time to time. “What it’s like to live here. Tell me everything.”\n\nPaul is normally so taciturn that “tell me everything” is likely to get you about two short sentences, max. Either this Paul is more willing to talk, or Josie’s red dress has magic powers. Because he starts telling me how he came to the city in the first place—and since I’m able to read between the lines, he actually tells me a whole lot more than that.\n\nHe came here “after New York fell.” Apparently he was born in NYC, just like my Paul, only a few months after his parents immigrated. His military service began three years ago, “two years before the compulsory age.” The advanced weaponry program had recruited him based on his scores on the “usual mandatory tests,” which I’m guessing don’t have much in common with the SATs. When I ask him about music, he loves Rachmaninoff as much here as he does back home—but has never heard of anyone from the past fifty years or so.\n\nThen again, Paul is so adorably clueless about pop culture in every dimension that he wouldn’t know any performer from the past fifty years anyway.\n\nEven this more talkative version of Paul isn’t comfortable monopolizing the conversation. So I try to do the thing I suck at the most. I flirt.\n\n“You ought to sit for me sometime,” I say.\n\n“Sit for you?”\n\n“As a model, for my sketches. You have the face for it.” My mind flashes back to one time my Paul sat for me—and showed off much more than his face—but if I start thinking about that in depth, my face will turn as red as my dress.\n\n“A face like a model. Hardly,” Paul says, but I can tell he’s flattered, and so embarrassed about it that he doesn’t know what to say. Paul has no more game in this universe than in my own.\n\nMight as well lay it on thick, have a little fun. “The lines of your face would work well, for an artist’s subject. Your jaw, your brow, your nose—straight and strong. Plus you have amazing eyes.”\n\nPaul’s expression is caught halfway between disbelief and pleasure. Probably he’d be more comfortable if I changed the subject, but I’ve hardly even gushed to my Paul about how much I love every single inch of his face. Might as well enjoy this. If I’d known it was so easy to bowl him over, I might have tried it long ago.\n\n“Your eyes are actually gray,” I say, more softly, so he has to lean closer to hear. “At first I thought they had to be blue, a very pale blue, but they’re not.”"

        "content": "“It says blue on my ID form.” He’s even worse at flirting than I am.\n\n“But you know they’re gray, right?” Maybe he doesn’t. Paul has never been a guy to spend much time looking in a mirror. “What color does your ID form say your hair is?”\n\n“Brown,” he replies, which isn’t exactly a wrong answer. But it isn’t exactly right, either.\n\n“Light brown, but also a little red, and a little gold.” The hours I’ve spent mixing paints, trying to get the right shade. Paul is a difficult man to capture. “You have good shoulders, good skin—good everything, really.”\n\n“You make it sound as if I were very handsome.”\n\n“You are.”\n\nThis gets me not a smile but a skeptical glance. “Most women seem to disagree with you.”\n\nThere was a time when I wouldn’t have agreed either. His beauty isn’t boy-band cute; he’s rougher than that, his appeal not as easy to see. Once I’d seen it, though, I became drawn to him on a primal, instinctive level I couldn’t deny.\n\nI suspect Paul is feeling much the same way now.\n\nWe eat our chicken chow mein; it’s a messy meal for a date, but I’m pretty good with a pair of chopsticks, and so is he. I keep the conversation going, and Paul—well, he tries to flirt back, clumsy as ever, but for me it’s enough just to see how much he’s enjoying himself.\n\nHalfway through the meal, though, it hits me. What happens after?\n\nAs soon as Theo and I have done our job here, we’ll leap out of this dimension forever. I’m not too worried about our other selves; they’ll be freaked out to find themselves in San Francisco, on the train, wherever—but they can find their way home easily enough. I doubt they’ll be in any more danger because of the war than they are already.\n\nBut Paul will probably guess what really happened. He’ll know that I wasn’t his Marguerite. All the hope I see in him now—this light in his eyes as he looks at me—that will be destroyed.\n\nMaybe not. Maybe he’ll react more like Theo and take some satisfaction in knowing that in another world, I loved him. In so many other worlds . . .\n\nNo. Because he won’t only be dealing with a broken heart. He’ll be dealing with the catastrophic destruction of the Firebird project, and this nation’s last hope for winning this war.\n\nYou deserve so much more than this, I think as he tells a story about traveling through the battle lines that cover the continent, on his journey from New York as a boy. We all do.\n\nThe tragedy of this world is just one more sin to lay at Conley’s feet.\n\nBut I’m the one doing it. I’m the one prioritizing Paul’s life over that of an entire world.\n\nNo. I won’t think about that. I can’t. The war began a long time before I got here, and I don’t understand how they’d use the Firebird to help anyway. They’re clutching at straws, that’s all. I’m simply . . . taking the straws away.\n\nSo I tell myself. But the words ring hollow.\n\nAt least I’ve given this Paul tonight—one night when it seems like his dreams are coming true.\n\nWhen we leave the restaurant, I slide my arm through Paul’s, for the two of us to walk together that close. The silence on the streets of San Francisco is almost eerie—to me, at least; Paul seems to expect the quiet.\n\nAlthough I gleaned a lot from Paul’s dinner conversation, I didn’t get any information about getting onto the base. Theo acted like it would be no big deal for me to steal Paul’s wallet in the middle of dinner. It’s not like I took Pickpocketing 101 with Fagin and the Artful Dodger.\n\nOnly one solution presents itself: Stay with Paul. Take this further than either Theo or I was willing to openly discuss.\n\n“Are you all right?” Paul says. “You seemed far away for a moment.”\n\n“I guess I was.” Focus, I remind myself. I won’t get many other chances at this.\n\n“Tonight—I’m glad this happened.” Then he pauses, trying to find the right words. “I mean, I’m sorry things went wrong between you and Private Beck, but I’m glad you called me. That we spent the evening together.”\n\nHe may not have game, but most of the time, simple works better than smooth. Paul’s clumsy, honest pleasure in my company charms me more than any player’s lines ever could. Even if this were the first time we’d ever met—if I weren’t already in love with him—I’d still feel an irrepressible smile spreading across my face. “Me too.”\n\nPaul keeps struggling to find the right words. “This isn’t—I haven’t gotten to do this very much. Go out, have fun.”\n\n“With women, you mean?” I toss this off lightly, knowing how utterly inexperienced my Paul is. Then I realize that might not be true here. What if he tells me about some other girl, some other relationship?\n\nBut he says, “With women, or with anyone. All of us have to work so hard; we seldom have time for anything else. You know as well as I do.”\n\nMaybe I do. This Marguerite seems to have made time for Theo between shifts at the munitions plant, though.\n\nThinking about the other Theo and the other me distracts me for a moment, but I’m snapped back to the present when I hear Paul say, “Where are you staying?”\n\nPaul’s just asking, probably wondering whether he should walk me there, or wait for the bus with me. From any other guy, though, that would be a hint—suggesting he wouldn’t mind an invitation to my room.\n\nTheo’s in my hotel room, so that’s out. However, if Paul and I could be alone—if I could distract him completely—I’d have all the time I wanted to go through his things, rummage through his wallet, and otherwise be the Mata Hari Theo told me to be.\n\nBut I’m not going to bed with him. No way.\n\nWith Lieutenant Markov, I thought I might be trapped in the grand duchess’s body forever; because of that, I acted for myself, not for her. And I’ve always known the grand duchess loved him, and she would have chosen to spend that one night with him, if she’d had the chance. But this Marguerite isn’t in love with Paul yet, and I won’t have sex with someone she wouldn’t consent to normally.\n\nEven kissing is a step over the line. This Marguerite wouldn’t like that, and I’d sworn I would never steal another first kiss between any of the Marguerites and her Paul. But this is different, a necessity rather than pure desire. With this plan, I can slip the Firebirds in my purse so he won’t notice them, kiss Paul until dawn, and search for info about the labs once he falls asleep. This is the smart move, I tell myself. The tactical move.\n\nWhich it is. But I can’t deny that I also want to be with Paul so badly it almost hurts. If I could just hold Paul close, feel him against me, then for a little while I wouldn’t be afraid for him. I’m so sick of feeling afraid. Paul makes me feel strong. Whole.\n\nAnd my Paul is within him—that one splinter of his soul.\n\n“My hotel’s not far,” I say quietly. “But I bet your place is closer.”\n\nPaul stops in his tracks. He stares at me, clearly astonished. “I—” It’s almost fun, watching him struggle for words. “Are you sure?”\n\n“I don’t mean— I couldn’t spend the night. Not yet. But I’d like to stay with you for a while longer, if that’s okay.”"

        "content": "There are really gross guys who assume a woman would never go to a man’s room for anything but sex, and wouldn’t hesitate to take advantage of someone alone with them behind a locked door. But Paul isn’t one of those guys, in this world or any other. “Whatever you want.”\n\nI look into his eyes, and the hope I see there slashes across me like claws. If only I could keep him from ever learning the truth about tonight.\n\nPaul hesitates before he says, “Is this about, well—revenge?”\n\n“Revenge?” I want my vengeance against Wyatt Conley, but how would Paul know that?\n\nI understand once Paul continues, “Against Private Beck. For leaving you alone in the city.”\n\n“Oh! No, it isn’t.” Will he believe that? Would I? “Maybe that’s why I called you. But it’s not why I had such a good time tonight, or why I want to stay with you longer.”\n\n“I wouldn’t want you to do anything you’d regret.”\n\nPaul, do you have to be such a perfect gentleman right now? “I won’t.”\n\n“It’s just—” He takes a deep breath, weighing the words he’s going to say. “Do you know when I first fell for you?”\n\nI shouldn’t hear this. Only the other Marguerite should hear this, ever. Paul shouldn’t be saying it out loud to someone who’s tricking him. But there’s no way for me to tell him to stop.\n\nHe takes my silence as permission to go on. “You remember the warehouse in Miramar we used as the first makeshift lab? Concrete walls and bare rebar. I don’t pay much attention to how places look, but that place depressed me.”\n\n“It would’ve depressed anyone,” I say, because that’s what it sounds like.\n\nPaul smiles. “But there was that one skylight that hadn’t been painted over, remember? With the panes that had been broken and taped so many times?”\n\nI nod, wondering why Paul would fixate on an old window.\n\n“You probably don’t remember, but there was one day—back early on when we were cleaning out the warehouse and getting it ready, you and Josie too—this one day, I saw you staring upward. I asked you what you were looking at, and you said, the light. You told me to watch the pattern of the light.”\n\nPaul’s entire expression has changed as he tells this story. The awkwardness is gone. It’s as if something is dawning inside him.\n\nHe continues, “The shafts of light cut across the top of the warehouse just so. You said it was beautiful—that you’d like to try and sketch that someday. And as long as we worked in that warehouse, I never forgot to look up at the light. Sometimes it felt like the one scrap of joy I could still have. And I thought, if Marguerite could find something, even here, that’s beautiful, she could make every day beautiful.”\n\n“That is—completely amazing.”\n\n“I always wondered if you would laugh at me, if I told you that.” Paul’s crooked smile pierces me through.\n\nLeaning closer, I shake my head. “I would never laugh at anything so perfect.”\n\n“Marguerite,” Paul murmurs, his voice reverent, as his fingers brush under my chin, lifting my face to his for a kiss.\n\nHis mouth covers mine, strong and warm. All the voices inside me—guilty, afraid, unsure—they all go silent. There’s no room left in my head anymore for anything or anyone but him.\n\nI’ve missed you so much. My hands fist in the lapels of Paul’s uniform jacket. He pulls me into his embrace as our kiss deepens, and I feel the safety and comfort that only comes when I’m in his arms. The silence of the night around us lets me hear the slight catch in his throat, the little sound of pleasure as we wind ourselves around each other. He slides one hand over my shoulder, fingers brushing against my neck. Any moment now, he’ll back me against the nearest building, and I want him to.\n\nBut instead he keeps caressing my neck, only that, which is so—chivalrous, and sweet, that it ironically only makes me want him more—\n\n—until his fingers wrap around the chain of a Firebird.\n\nI jerk back as he pulls; the chain snaps, stinging my skin. While I still have one of the Firebirds (which one? His or mine?), the other is in his grasp. Paul steps away from me, half turning to look at the Firebird in his hand. As he does, the expression on his face changes from disbelief to anger.\n\nThe Firebirds have that quality of things from another dimension—visible, tangible, but unlikely to be noticed by anyone in their home dimension unless their attention is called to it.\n\nOr if you knew about them already. Like this dimension’s Paul, who works on the Firebird project.\n\n“Give that back,” I say. If I’m going to get home and save my Paul, I need both my Firebirds. “Give it to me!”\n\n“Earlier, I caught a glimpse—” Paul shakes his head. “I thought, it can’t be. If the Doctors Caine had completed a Firebird, they would have told me. Nor would they have given it to you. But now I understand. This Firebird came from another dimension.” When he looks at me again, his eyes are the color of steel. “Like you.”\n\nBusted.\n\n11\n\n“PLEASE.” I HOLD OUT MY HAND FOR THE FIREBIRD. “I NEED that.”\n\n“To get back to the dimension you came from.” I’ve never seen Paul’s face like this. Most people grimace when they’re angry, as if the rage is twisting them up outside as well as inside. Not Paul. He goes still, turns cold. Right now he might as well have been carved of stone.\n\nPaul always values honesty. So I just say it. “Yes. To go home again, and for lots of other reasons too. Don’t leave me stranded here.”\n\nHis jaw drops slightly, and I realize that he didn’t expect me to admit where I’m really from. And maybe, within his anger, there’s a hint of the wonder I felt the very first time I traveled with the Firebird. Realizing that it works—that travel between dimensions is actually possible—was one of the most mind-blowing moments of my life. It must be for him too.\n\nMaybe I can use that. I venture, “Everything Mom and Dad thought they could do—everything you believed they were capable of—the Firebirds are all that and more.” He gives me a look; I can’t tell if he’s feeling less hostile or not, but he hasn’t moved. I hope I can take that as a good sign. “People are depending on me. I have to keep going; lives are at stake. Please don’t trap me here.”\n\n“How long have you been in our dimension? Weeks? Months?”\n\n“Only a few days, I swear.” The lone streetlight nearby paints the scene in chiaroscuro—deep shadows, and the stark lines of light that reveal his anger. I wonder what he sees in me. “I was forced to come here.”\n\nPaul’s stare bores through me. I’ve never sounded less convincing.\n\nSo I change tactics. “Can we just sit down and talk about this? I’d never want to hurt you, Paul. Never. Back home—in my dimension—you and I got off to a better start, and—”\n\n“How convenient.” The tone of Paul’s voice could lower the temperature by twenty degrees. “That we’re all such good friends.”\n\n“Of course we are. The patterns between the dimensions, the way they bring people together, over and over again—it’s like destiny.” My Paul believed in fate even before we began traveling with the Firebirds. This one doesn’t."

        "content": "He turns the Firebird over in his hand, even more curious than he is angry. Then it hits me: The very thing Paul’s been trying to create for the past few years—the thing he and my parents believe can turn the tide of this horrific war—it’s his now, not mine, and there is no way he’ll ever give it back.\n\n“Please!” I take a step closer, but when he turns to look at me, I know I’d better not come any nearer.\n\n“What was tonight about?” Paul says. “Coming on to me? Seducing me? What kind of game are you playing? Why are you here?”\n\n“I’m here to save you. Not—you you. My Paul, from my universe. He’s been splintered. Have you guys discovered the risk of splintering yet?”\n\n“Consciousness becoming divided during interdimensional travel?”\n\n“Yes! Exactly!” Oh, thank God for that, because I’d never have been able to explain the science behind it. “My Paul splintered. I mean, he was splintered, on purpose, and he’ll never be able to come back home again unless I rescue him.” Talking about him in the third person, to his face, feels strange. Worse, it feels futile. My legs have begun to shake. This has to sound crazy, spilled out all at once like this, and I can tell Paul doesn’t believe me. In desperation, I say, “Couldn’t you tell? The way I was with you—I wasn’t pretending, not really. I love him so much.”\n\n“So much you seduced someone else?” Paul tilts his head as he studies me, with distaste. “How touching.”\n\n“I wasn’t going to sleep with you. Besides, you’re not someone else! A splinter of his soul is inside you, and—and it wouldn’t matter, even if it weren’t. You’re him, and he’s you.”\n\nPaul flinches when I tell him about the splinter within him, but he doesn’t respond. “You were with me just because you missed him so much? You wanted the next best thing? Somehow I doubt it. You’ve confessed to being from another dimension. You have a fully operational Firebird—the technology we’ve been trying to create here for a long time. Technology we need very badly. If you’ve been in this dimension for as much as a day, you know how the war is going.”\n\nI nod. “The air raid was my first night here.”\n\n“Then you have no excuse. If you’re your parents’ daughter—and in love with another me, one so similar you find us interchangeable—you should have turned this technology over to us immediately.”\n\nI remember the lesson I learned the hard way as a little kid, when I tried to sneak around my parents’ rules: Trying to outsmart a genius rarely ends well.\n\nPaul takes one step toward me, reminding me powerfully of his greater size and strength. “Do you want to change your story? Or stick to the original lie? The latter technique works better during interrogations. That’s what they tell us.”\n\nIn this dimension, they prepare people for being captured and tortured. If I’m turned in as an invader or a spy, this is what will happen to me. Paul wouldn’t hurt me—I know that much—but he might report me to people crueler than he is. I’m so far out of my depth here that I have only one possible defense left: the truth.\n\n“No. I wasn’t with you only because I missed you. I do miss you—him, okay, him. I love him. That’s why I’m doing this. The only reason I’d ever do this.” The cold wind whips around us, making me shiver. We seem to be the only people on this entire street—otherwise deserted and desolate. “My Paul really was splintered against his will. The people who did it won’t give him back unless I do what they say. They told me to . . . to sabotage your work here. To ruin the Firebird project if I could. That’s the only way they’ll let me know the other dimensions Paul is hidden in.”\n\nPaul believes me. I almost wish he didn’t. “You’re here to sabotage us?” His fist tightens around the Firebird; the metal corners must be cutting into the skin of his palm. But he doesn’t even notice it. “That’s why you cozied up to me tonight? To get information?”\n\nI feel so cheap, so small. But I shout back, “To save my Paul? I’d do worse than that. I would do anything to get him back home and safe. Anything in the world—in all the worlds. And that means I need the Firebird.”\n\nHe stands completely still for a moment—long enough to give me hope—before he says, “Not as much as I do.”\n\n“Paul, please.”\n\nBut already Paul has turned his face from me and begun walking away. No goodbyes.\n\nI want to chase Paul down, plead with him, but I already know it wouldn’t do any good. If I could only prove to him how deeply I love him, how well I know him.\n\nSo I call, “You—you don’t get along with your parents! You think your dad’s a bad person, and your mom won’t stand up to him, so you try to stay away from them. You won’t even tell me anything else about them. You always sleep with one foot outside the covers. And you—you don’t enjoy porn that much because you think the men and women never seem to actually like each other, and that ruins it for you, which is basically the sweetest thing ever. But naked pictures are okay! You’re into those.” No—stupid subject to pick—it just makes me sound crazier. “Your favorite cake is chocolate with caramel icing! You like rock climbing—”\n\nBut he wouldn’t have any time to go rock climbing in this universe. Ration cards wouldn’t allow for much chocolate cake or caramel icing. I’m calling out things about my Paul that this one doesn’t remember or understand.\n\nI’m calling to my Paul, really. The one who’s lost to me. The one hidden deep within the man stalking away into the dark, leaving me alone.\n\nThe entire walk back to my hotel, I feel like I ought to be crying. Or panicking. Instead, I trudge forward, almost numb with shock and despair.\n\nI screwed up everything. My Paul is still in danger, and I may have just made it impossible to ever get him back. I would’ve thought that was the worst feeling imaginable—but the reaction of the Paul from this dimension burns it in deeper. Salt in the wound. He caught me trying to betray him, my parents, everyone in this entire world—and called me out about flirting with him, which now seems so cheap and stupid and small.\n\nIt’s one thing to fail, another to fail in a way that makes you ashamed you even tried.\n\nThe single Firebird hanging around my neck now is Paul’s—so I still have that sliver of his soul. It helps a little to think that he’s still safe. If this were the Firebird about to be disassembled and broken down into component parts for study, then I would have lost him forever. One Paul would have unknowingly murdered another.\n\nBut losing my own Firebird is catastrophe enough.\n\nThe old-fashioned clock in the hotel lobby says it’s after midnight by the time I come in the door. As I ride up in the elevator, I think, Theo’s our last chance. How would Theo be able to get close to Paul, especially now that Paul is going to distrust every single person he meets? How could Theo use the computer virus to tear the project apart? I don’t know, but he’s going to have to figure it out.\n\nWhen I enter the hotel room, the lights are off. Of course—Theo went to sleep already. He’s lying on the bed, on his side, and somehow his face looks innocent. That’s a first."

        "content": "I have to wake him up. He has to know how badly this went wrong, so he can help me figure out a Plan B.\n\nEven though I still can’t fully trust Theo, I know I need him now.\n\nRemembering his reaction to the red dress, though, I go ahead and change in the bathroom, wrapping myself in the white robe I brought. The robe’s fabric is as thin and cheap as I’ve come to expect in this universe, and the hotel doesn’t seem to consider “heat” one of the guest amenities. So I’m shivering as I sit on the edge of the bed and whisper, “Theo?”\n\n“Mm.” He stirs slightly, but then snuggles back into the pillow.\n\nI put one hand on his shoulder. The remaining Firebird dangles from my robe as I lean closer. Theo’s skin is warm through the white fabric of his undershirt. “Hey. Wake up.”\n\nHe half turns, opens his eyes, and gives me a groggy smile. Then he slings one arm around my waist and tows me down onto the bed.\n\nI try to protest, but I can’t speak, because his mouth is covering mine.\n\nTheo and I kissed only once before, and it was a pretty good kiss—but nothing like this. This is passionate, warm, searching. At first I’m too startled to react, and before I can even speak, he rolls over so that he’s on top of me. This isn’t my Theo.\n\n“I was having the weirdest dream,” he murmurs as his hands press mine against the mattress. “Sorry I fell asleep. Let me make it up to you.”\n\nHe kisses me again, and I feel the weight of his Firebird against my chest. I pull back and turn my face from his. “Theo, wait.”\n\n“Hey, what’s wrong?” He pulls back and props up on one elbow—even as his other hand trails down my body, casually curving over my breast before coming to rest on my belly. “Are you all right?”\n\n“Hang on.” I grab his Firebird, quickly set a reminder, and—\n\n“Gahh!” Theo shoves himself backward, slamming into the headboard. The pain of the reminder makes him clutch his chest, but it’s the sudden rush of memories that make his eyes go wide. “Oh, I—I just— I didn’t mean to—oh, crap.”\n\n“It’s okay.” I’m so grateful to have him back with me that I don’t care about what just happened here.\n\nTheo, however, does. “Listen, Marguerite, I’m so, so sorry about—the kissing, and the hands, and—I’m just really sorry I did that.”\n\n“It’s all right. You weren’t yourself. Literally.” I straighten my robe as I sit up, trying to make myself forget it all.\n\n“Right. Got it. Moving on.” Then Theo stares at my throat. “Wait. You’re missing a Firebird. Where’s the other one?”\n\n“Paul has it. Theo, he figured it out. He knows everything, and he took my Firebird.”\n\nI vent the story to him, holding nothing back; I tell Theo what I felt, what I did, from the first smile on the sidewalk to my brazen offer to go to Paul’s place, all the way to shouting out the things I knew about my Paul as the other one walked off. By the end, my voice is shaking—from fear, rather than any urge to cry. I’m so scared for my Paul now that it eclipses everything else.\n\nOur eyes meet, and I know we’re both worried about the same thing. If I tried to travel home with Paul’s Firebird—the one storing a splinter of his soul—would I destroy it? If so, then my choices may be living in this universe forever or killing Paul.\n\n“We have to think of something,” I say. “Some way to get to Paul, to get that Firebird back. I don’t know how we even start to—”\n\n“Hey.” Theo takes my hand in both of his. “We’re going to figure something out. All right? Don’t panic.”\n\n“I’m not panicking.” Even as I say it, though, I’m trembling so hard my entire body shakes. “But I don’t know what to do.”\n\n“It’s late. You’re tired, and you’ve had one hell of a night. Right now you need to calm down. Take deep breaths, try to sleep. We’ll tackle this in the morning.”\n\n“How am I supposed to sleep? Even if we could get Conley to tell us the other two dimensions we need to search, we can’t save Paul and get home. Not without that other Firebird.”\n\nThe springs of the mattress creak as he leans closer to me, and his fingers tighten around mine. “If we figure out where Paul is, and we only have two Firebirds, then I’ll give you mine. You’ll be able to take him home.”\n\n“But—you’d be left behind.”\n\n“You’d come back for me,” Theo says simply. “Or Paul would. One way or another, I’d get home in the end.”\n\nHe says that knowing how strange it is to be lost in another version of yourself. Knowing how dangerous other dimensions can be. “I can’t let you do that.”\n\n“The hell you can’t. You’re not the only one who loves Paul Markov, okay? Anything you’d do to get your boyfriend back, I’d do for my best friend.” He shakes his head; in the moonlight filtering through the window shade, I can see his rueful smile. “Or do you still think I’m the same as that other Theo? Always looking out for number one?”\n\n“You’re not him,” I say, just as I’ve said many times before. Maybe I’m finally starting to believe it. “But . . . do we even have the right to do this? To sabotage this technology when they feel like it’s their only hope?”\n\n“They don’t know that. We don’t know that.”\n\n“If there’s any chance they’re right, then I’m basically prioritizing my Paul’s life over the lives of every other person in this dimension.”\n\nTheo scowls in irritation. “I have two words for you. Global and warfare. We didn’t start the fire, Marguerite. The war going on in this dimension is bigger than the people we’ve met here. Bigger than this country. Could the Firebird help them? Maybe. But from what I can see, no one weapon could win it for them. So we can’t tie ourselves in knots worrying about these guys. We have to look out for ourselves. I need a cure, and Paul needs to come together and get back home. Right?”\n\nI believe what he’s saying, mostly. Yet guilt still weighs me down. “I guess.”\n\nMore gently, he adds, “Now, come on. Try to sleep.”\n\nEven though I want to argue with him, I can feel exhaustion creeping over me, dark and heavy. I ease down onto the bed, lying on my left side so that I can look toward the moonlight. The second my head touches the pillow, I know I won’t be awake long.\n\nThe mattress shifts as Theo moves toward the floor, but I reach back and catch his arm. “Don’t go.”\n\nAfter a moment, he lies down behind me, spooning around my back as he wraps one arm around my waist. It could be a lover’s embrace, but it’s not. He’s simply here with me, close enough for me to hear him breathe, so even in sleep I’ll know I’m not in this alone.\n\nYet I can’t stop my imagination from wandering across San Francisco. I envision shabby military housing, and Paul sitting on the edge of his bed, alone. The Firebird is in his hand, and he’s mad as hell. But his heart is broken just the same.\n\n12\n\nBY NEXT MORNING, THEO AND I ARE IN STRATEGY MODE.\n\n“First thing we have to figure out is whether Paul has talked to your parents,” Theo says as he combs his wet hair wearing just his undershirt and uniform pants."

        "content": "“My guess is yes.” Then I think about that for a moment, pulling my rumpled robe more closely around me. “Actually, no. Not yet. They aren’t as close here. Besides, Paul would want to think through everything, examine the Firebird, all on his own, before he said anything. But he will tell them.”\n\n“And soon. It won’t take Paul long to figure that thing out, especially not if they were on the verge of the breakthrough here already.” Theo sighs. “Never thought I’d be pissed off that my research partner is so freakin’ brilliant, but here we are. Anyway. Second question is, will your parents believe him?”\n\n“Maybe? At first, they’d have to wonder. But as soon as he’s able to show them the Firebird itself—or the schematics—Mom and Dad will realize what it is. Then they’ll know he’s telling the truth.”\n\n“Then we need to work fast.”\n\nWe have two goals we must accomplish, and they work against each other. I need Paul to trust me enough to hand the Firebird over again, and yet I also need to betray him and destroy his work. There’s no way to make both of those happen—\n\n—or is there?\n\n“Hang on,” I say to Theo as I jump from the bed and slide my feet into a pair of shoes.\n\nWhile I straighten my robe, Theo says, “Where are you going?”\n\n“To the phone!”\n\nHappily, nobody’s waiting to use the one telephone on the floor, so it’s all mine. After the seemingly endless process of using a rotary dial, I get the military base. “Extension, please,” says the bored-sounding operator.\n\n“No extension. I want to leave an urgent message for Lieutenant Paul Markov. It should say, Meet me at nine a.m., at Fisherman’s Wharf.” Oh God, I hope they still have that in this dimension’s San Francisco.\n\nApparently so, because the operator says, “Yes, ma’am. Who is the message from?”\n\n“Marguerite Caine. The daughter of the Doctors Caine.”\n\nThis mention gets the operator’s attention, just like it was supposed to. “Yes, ma’am. We’ll get this to him right away.”\n\n“Thanks,” I say. As soon as I hang up, I run toward the hotel room to shower and dress in a hurry. We’ll have to rush to get to Fisherman’s Wharf on time.\n\nOn our way there, Theo and I could pass for any other couple in this world. He wears his military uniform, complete with green cloth hat on his head. My navy-blue dress isn’t nearly as slinky as last night’s outfit, but honestly that’s a relief. The red one should really be kept in a glass box with a little hammer and a sign that says DO NOT WEAR EXCEPT IN EMERGENCY.\n\nWhen we get to Fisherman’s Wharf, I’m astonished to see that it looks like—well, a wharf. Used by fishermen. Instead of the familiar touristy extravaganza of restaurant signs and funky sculptures and hop-on/hop-off buses, I see boats and a fish market. Not all the boats are fishing trawlers, though; several look more like coast guard vessels, complete with mounted guns. A few places along the wharf offer food, but rather than overpriced burgers, they sell the kind of stuff that comes in brown paper bags so people can grab them and eat as they go.\n\n“I always thought I hated our version of Fisherman’s Wharf,” Theo says. “Now I kind of miss it.”\n\n“Yeah, me too.” In the distance I can hear the bark of a sea lion; at least they’re still here, sunning themselves. Not everything changes.\n\nGlancing at the nearest food stall, Theo asks, “Think we’ve got time to look for doughnuts?”\n\n“How can you think of doughnuts at a time like this?” Honestly, though, I’m hungry too. Our hotel didn’t have room service, and probably hasn’t for decades.\n\n“How can you not? You want us to do some serious strategizing today? We’re gonna need fuel. Preferably chocolate-glazed fuel.”\n\nI give him a warm smile—which fades in an instant as I look to the left.\n\nPaul stands there, hands in his pockets, waiting.\n\nTheo sees him only a moment later. He curses under his breath, and Paul raises an eyebrow.\n\n“So,” Paul says. “You two made up.” Obviously he’s unsure how much he can say in front of Theo.\n\nUnderstanding this, Theo slips his finger under the collar of his shirt to pull up a short length of gold chain. “Actually, I rode with her.”\n\n“The two of you came here together.” Paul’s tone turns bitter. “How does this fit in with your so-called love for me, Marguerite?”\n\n“Hey. Shut it, pal.” Theo steps forward. “I’m not with her—not in our dimension, anyway. I’m a friend of hers, and by the way, a friend of yours. I came here to help her out. To rescue you. Well, also myself, but definitely you too.”\n\nPaul, clearly taken aback by Theo’s total understanding of the situation, snaps, “Stop talking about him as if he’s me. He isn’t. We’re two different people.”\n\n“Okay, fine, sure,” I say. It’s not worth arguing about at this point. We need to get on the same page. “I’m glad you came.”\n\nHe doesn’t answer at first. Then Paul says, “I haven’t slept.”\n\nTheo makes a scoffing sound, like Why should we care? He’s too defensive. But I can tell Paul’s telling the absolute truth. Now that I’ve recovered from the first shock of seeing him, I can see the stubble on his face, the dark shadows under his eyes. Quietly I ask, “Why not?”\n\n“I stayed up all night with this.” Paul pulls the stolen Firebird from his pocket. My first instinct is to lunge for it, but I remain still, except for holding out one hand to keep Theo back. Paul continues, “I ran the data over and over. I’ve learned a lot, but I have a lot further to go. In other words—if you want it back, the answer is still no.”\n\n“Listen to me.” I step closer to Paul. “Remember what I said last night? This man, Wyatt Conley, intends to sabotage your work in this dimension. If we fail, he’s just going to send someone else. Lots of someone elses. Conley’s not a man who gives up until he gets what he wants.”\n\nPaul retorts, “So I should surrender to you now and save myself the trouble?”\n\nTheo’s eyes narrow. Obviously he’d like to rip into Paul. But I told him to let me take the lead on this, and he lives up to his promise, saying nothing.\n\n“Here’s the bargain I’m offering you,” I tell Paul. “In our dimension, Theo works on the Firebird project too. He helped build this. If you agree, Theo will sit down with you and explain everything about how this works. He’ll go over your own designs, critique them, whatever it takes to get you guys ready to make a Firebird of your own.”\n\n“You’re a physicist?” Paul says to Theo. The amount of surprise in his voice isn’t insulting—but it comes close.\n\n“Hey, I might have been tracked into telemetry systems this time around, but in my dimension? I taught you everything you know.” Theo grins. “Well. Almost everything. I have to keep a few things to myself. Maintain my advantage.”\n\nI cut in. “He can get you there, Paul. If you let Theo show you, you can crack the secrets of the Firebird within the day.”\n\nHe doesn’t even know what to say to an offer that good. “Then I’m supposed to give this back to you. And—and you’d take back the splinter of your Paul’s consciousness. Is that all?”"

        "content": "I shake my head. “No. For this world’s safety, and so I can get my own Paul back home, we have to make Wyatt Conley believe we’ve sabotaged your work. But maybe that doesn’t mean we have to actually do it. Could you and Theo create a simulation?”\n\n“A simulation of what?” Paul says.\n\nI don’t really know. “Whatever it would look like if your computer networks were destroyed. If your data were erased by a virus. If we had something like that—then, when Conley checks, he’ll think you guys are defenseless, when really you’ll be building your first Firebirds even before I get home.”\n\nPaul looks even less convinced than before. “You can do that?”\n\nTheo, realizing it’s time for him to step in, nods. “With your cooperation. And also, that Lieutenant Colonel Wyatt Conley who keeps trying to work with you? You have to find a way to keep that guy one hundred percent out of the loop. Our Conley could get inside him, learn what he knows, and find out we faked the whole thing.”\n\nEven though I can tell Paul has begun to believe us, he still doesn’t agree. “This could be a trick. Maybe you’re going to lead me in the wrong direction, tell me things about the Firebird’s construction that aren’t true.”\n\n“Do you really not get it?” I could smack him upside the head. “I love my parents. I love my sister. And I love you. Do you think I’d ever leave you guys defenseless in the middle of a war, if I had any other choice? Well, as of this morning, I thought of another choice. So let’s take it together, okay?”\n\n“We’re not the same,” Paul says again. “Your Paul and me.”\n\nShaking my head, I smile. “You are, in ways you can’t even begin to imagine.”\n\n“Enough relationship talk,” Theo says. “You taking the deal or what, buddy?”\n\nPaul hesitates one moment longer before saying, “Come with me.”\n\nWe spend the rest of the day on base; Theo’s military ID and my status with my parents make it easy for Paul to get us access. For the next few hours, Theo and Paul get caught up in mega-dense scientific talk, while I drink awful fake coffee and watch them at work. Even here at the base, things are done low-tech when possible; Theo scribbles math equations on a chalkboard, occasionally brushing his hands free of yellowish dust, and Paul uses an honest-to-God slide rule. Theo’s natural affection for Paul slips out from time to time; I can tell Paul both notices it and has no idea what to do with it.\n\nSo far as he can, Paul pretends I’m not even there. At first I think this is because he hates me for what I did last night. As time goes on, though, I start to wonder. The way he finds himself watching me, then suddenly turns away, awkward and unsure—it’s not unlike the way Paul looked at me back at home, when we’d started to care about each other but didn’t yet know what to do about it.\n\nThis Paul’s feelings for his Marguerite are too strong to be pushed aside. Even when he’s angry. Even when he’s hurt and scared. He still loves her.\n\nWill she ever fall in love with him, too?\n\nThey keep talking science. They set the Triadverse virus loose on a data backup that should pass for the real thing. They get to where they work together almost as smoothly as Theo does with my Paul back at home.\n\nFinally, around two in the afternoon, Theo sits up straight and says, “You’ve got the data, now. Another few days of review, and you’ll be ready to build.”\n\nAfter a long moment, Paul says, “Thank you.”\n\nThat cost him; I can tell. So I say, “Thank you for giving me another chance. I know I didn’t deserve it.”\n\nHe looks up at me, and for one instant I glimpse the disappointment there—the hope he felt so briefly last night before it was snatched away. Despite what he must be feeling, Paul holds the Firebird out to me. As I take it, he says, “I knew from the data that you were telling me the truth about—about most things. It made me think you might be telling the truth about it all. If there’s a version of me in trouble out there, I’d like to think someone was coming for him.”\n\n“That sounds more like the Paul Markov I remember.” Theo grins in relief.\n\nTo Paul I say, “We’re going to bring him home. But he’s not only out there. He’s here, too.”\n\nHe looks down at his chest, as if the splinter of my Paul’s soul might be hidden inside his own heart.\n\nI step closer to him. “No need to tense up like that. It’s not going to screw with your head or anything.”\n\n“Theo says the retrieval method is the same as a reminder,” Paul says. “Reminders hurt, and now I have to take one. How would that not make me tense?”\n\nTheo leans against the nearest wall and shrugs. “You have to admit, he’s got a point.”\n\n“Hold on.” I slip my own Firebird around my neck, then press Paul’s against Paul’s chest. Even through his uniform jacket, I can feel the warmth of his body under my palm. When I raise my eyes to his face, he’s looking down at me, and I know we’re both remembering how we stood like this last night, just before we kissed.\n\nOr maybe what I see in Paul’s gray eyes is that splinter of my Paul. The one I really love.\n\nI hit the combination Conley taught me in Italy. Paul shudders from the flash of pain, but he makes no sound. The Firebird seems to vibrate in my palm. There it is—the faintest little flicker of heat, the proof that I’ve recovered the second splinter.\n\n“We’ve got him.” I breathe out heavily, then grin at Theo.\n\nHe grins back. “Two down, two to go.”\n\nPaul is by far the least enthusiastic of the three of us. “I don’t feel any different.”\n\n“You don’t?” I would’ve thought my Paul’s soul would affect his more. Yet this Paul is already a scientist, already in love with me. Maybe he and my Paul are too much alike for him to feel the impact. “Well, it worked. I promise.”\n\n“You promise a lot of things,” Paul says flatly.\n\nI don’t want to leave this universe when he’s angry with me. Is that childish? Even selfish? Probably. Yet I want to heal the wound I caused—just like I want to heal all the others. “We’re okay?”\n\n“You unlocked the final secrets of the Firebird. So we’re even.” Paul doesn’t smile as he says it. “Next time, consider asking for what you need, instead of treating me like a fool.”\n\nThat stings, but maybe I deserved it. I keep my voice gentle. “Hang in there, all right? With your Marguerite, I mean. You never know when things might change.”\n\n“Hey. I’m standing right here,” Theo protests.\n\n“Sorry, Theo. I just meant— Paul, I told you there was such a thing as destiny. It brings us together, over and over again, dimension after dimension. Destiny won’t let you down.”\n\n“I wish I could believe that.” Paul stands up and walks to the door. Apparently emotional sharing time is over. “One of the men on security detail can show you two out.”\n\n“Why out?” Theo takes his Firebird in hand. “Marguerite and I can pop out right here. Then you can explain to our other, slightly lesser versions exactly what the hell is going on, because, trust me, they’re gonna want to know.”\n\nPaul opens the door. “I don’t want to watch,” he says quietly. “I’ll come for you both immediately. But when you—go back to the way things were—I don’t want to see that happen.”"

        "content": "He means he doesn’t want to watch the moment when this world’s Theo and I once again look at each other with love.\n\nI walk out, knowing Theo will follow, and I don’t allow myself to look at Paul’s face again.\n\nOnce Theo and I are alone in the corridor, accompanied by the sound of typewriters clattering within office doors, he says, “Look on the bright side, chica. We’ve got the Firebird. We’ve got a good cover story in place. This is progress.”\n\nI swallow the lump in my throat to reply. “Conley might find out we didn’t really sabotage them.” Even before I suggested the plan, I knew that was a risk. That risk looms larger now, casting its shadow over my hopes.\n\n“Yeah, he might. But we could make it seem like this Paul tricked us, something like that. And if this world’s Conley never learns the truth, we might get away with it completely.”\n\n“He has to learn eventually, doesn’t he?”\n\n“Eventually could be a long time from now.” As Theo opens the door and we walk outside, he glances over his shoulder, in the direction we came from. “This Paul’s kind of a hard-ass, isn’t he?\n\n“No. Just hurt.” I think of the way he looked at me last night—hopeful, dazzled, halfway to being in love—and I feel even more like scum than before.\n\nBut Theo’s right about one thing. We have the Firebirds. So far as Conley knows, we completed half the job. One more dimension, one more mission, one more betrayal. Then and only then will we go to the home office and learn the final universe hiding the last splinter of Paul’s soul.\n\n“At least we have something to use against Conley now.” That was the idea I clung to when this trip began—that I’d find a way to undermine Conley, that instead of simply doing his bidding, I’d turn his own plan against him. “Conley wants to monopolize the ability to travel through dimensions. Now we’ve guaranteed that’s not going to happen.”\n\nSlowly, Theo smiles. “There’s that fighting spirit. Now, do we know where we’re headed?”\n\nQuickly I double-check my Firebird around my neck; the second set of coordinates have been unlocked. “Yeah, sending you the data now. Mission one-half accomplished. Let’s go.”\n\nTheo pauses. “A whole other world.” When I give him a look, he shakes his head. “I know that’s the idea. But it’s like I only just started believing this place was real.”\n\n“Soon it’s going to seem like a bad dream,” I reassure him.\n\n“I don’t know,” Theo says as he takes his Firebird in hand. “This place had its benefits.”\n\nOur eyes meet, and I know he’s remembering the way he kissed me last night.\n\nBut it’s over in an instant, as the Firebird rips us out of these bodies, this world, forever.\n\n13\n\nWHEN I SLAM INTO MYSELF, I’M WALKING ALONG A CROWDED sidewalk, and I nearly trip over my own feet.\n\nA beefy guy in a Yankees jersey bumps into me from behind. “Hey, it’s a sidewalk. For walking. Got it?”\n\nAnother voice nearby mutters, “Tourists.”\n\nI flatten myself against the nearest building, where I won’t be in anyone’s way. Where have I wound up this time? It’s daylight, and there are—wow, hundreds of people and at least three food carts just on this stretch of sidewalk.\n\nI look up and start to smile, because even though I’ve never been here before, I know exactly where I am.\n\nTimes Square.\n\nVisitors to the city clutch shopping bags or record the scene on their smartphones, while locals in business clothes walk twice as fast as anyone else as they weave in and out. Although I can hear car horns nearby, the street right next to me seems to have been closed off a long time ago; the space is instead filled with shaded picnic tables, where people eat and hang out. Above me are tall buildings bearing billboards about the size of my house, and so many glittering lights that they shine even in the middle of the day. Nearby a news ticker scrolls headlines like:\n\nPRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY TO MAKE STATE VISIT TO BRAZIL\n\nNISSAN AND TOYOTA ANNOUNCE MERGER\n\nUK PARLIAMENT VOTES FOR GENERAL ELECTION\n\nOSCAR WINNER HUGH JACKMAN RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL.\n\nThose all look familiar enough—except that I don’t think Hugh Jackman has won an Academy Award in my world. Beside the fact that I’m in New York City, this dimension doesn’t appear to be very different from my own. At any rate, it’s better than the desolate world at war we left behind.\n\nFor a moment I remember Paul saying goodbye to me there—the distrust, the betrayal in his eyes. Just thinking about it burns. No, I don’t ever want to see that Warverse again.\n\nMy clothes seem like exactly the kind of thing I’d have at home—though the dark green dress and the low-heeled lace-up oxfords are a little fancier than I’d generally wear for everyday. A cross-body bag hangs at my hip, and I start fishing around inside for clues. Keys, lip gloss, chewing gum: All that tells me is that Clinique and Trident exist here too. Inside a silver leather wallet I find a New York State ID card—no driver’s license—but my address is printed on the ID, so now I know I live on Eighty-Third Street. Also a yellow and blue Metrocard, which I’m guessing is what you use on the subway. Some cash, a case for the sunglasses I realize I’m wearing atop my head, and—yes. My smartphone.\n\nIt wants a code to unlock. At home I use Josie’s birthday, so I plug that in and, boom, I’m in. Maybe I should be less predictable, I think, but I can’t stop smiling.\n\nBefore anything else, I go into contacts and scroll down to the Ms. Then the Ps. Paul isn’t listed.\n\nDo I not even know him in this universe? This is New York City; in our world, that’s where Paul was born. So he should be here, shouldn’t he? If I can’t get to this dimension’s Paul Markov, how am I supposed to rescue the next part of Paul’s soul?\n\nMaybe you just haven’t met this world’s Paul yet, I remind myself. Or you might already know him, but the two of you aren’t close enough to exchange numbers at this point. Paul had worked with my parents almost a year before I put his number in my phone; I didn’t need to contact him on my own, and even if I had, he was at my house nearly every day. Texting him wasn’t a big priority.\n\nThe tight coil of fear within me slowly relaxes. I shouldn’t panic yet.\n\nResigned, I scan through the rest of my contacts. There’s Mom, Dad, Josie—and yes, Theo, here in NYC so no need to use the locator on the Firebird—but that’s when my phone buzzes and a calendar alert comes up: Movie w/R at AMC 42nd. Looks like that’s in fifteen minutes.\n\nI’m only a couple of blocks from Forty-Second, as it turns out. So I hurry through the packs of people gawking at the signs, the other tourists, and the Hello Kitty store. Obviously I’d rather spend the next couple of hours studying this dimension than sitting in a movie theater, but if I’m going to pass as this world’s Marguerite, I shouldn’t blow off her plans without a good reason.\n\nWhen I get to the front of the theater, I’m not sure whether to go in or to wait outside for someone to recognize me—which is when I hear a woman’s voice call out, in an English accent, “Marguerite! There you are!”\n\nI turn around to see Romola.\n\nSomehow I manage to conceal my astonishment. It’s definitely her: same dark gold hair, same square jaw and stubborn chin. We’ve run into each other in a couple of worlds now, but never before have we been friends. Here, though, Romola comes up to me with a smile on her face. Instead of the expensive, glamorous clothes she wore in the Londonverse, she’s got on normal jeans and a sweater. As she walks up to me, she smiles and holds up her phone, revealing a bar code. “Since you were running late, I went ahead and bought our tickets.”"

        "content": "“Thanks,” I say, but then I can’t think what to add.\n\nFortunately Romola’s ahead of me. “You can make it up to me by getting the popcorn. And M&M’s! They’re so good mixed together.”\n\nHer presence here weirds me out in a way I can’t explain, even to myself. She’s someone I’ve met before, but never known well. I thought of Romola as—an accident, a coincidence. Not a person who was supposed to mean a lot to me.\n\nJust like Paul should be everyplace, everywhere with me, and he’s not.\n\nThe movie turns out to be one I’d meant to see at home, and Romola’s right about the popcorn-plus-M&M’s mix. So by the time we’re walking out of the theater in the late afternoon, my mood has improved. This world is no more dangerous than my own; Mom, Dad, and Josie are all alive and well; and there’s a text message waiting for me from Theo, which says only, Turns out I live in Alphabet City. Headed your way.\n\n“Tonight’s the big dinner, isn’t it?” Romola’s smile turns almost wicked as she says it. “You have to tell me everything.”\n\nAs casually as possible, I ask, “What do you want for the highlight reel?”\n\n“Let’s see. The absolute most awkward question your parents ask him. And oh, if he looks intimidated or even unsure at any moment, get a photo if you can, would you? I can’t wait to see my big, bad boss being interrogated by your parents.” She’s joking, but not; her glee at the thought of this dinner is real.\n\nSo in this world, we met through her boss? Maybe she works for some other world-class scientist; that might explain how Romola and I keep coming together. Right now she’s looking at me for a reply, one I’m not sure how to make, so I bunt. “Oh, sure, I’ll film the whole thing, zoom in on his face. He won’t notice that.”\n\nThe sarcasm covers my ignorance well enough. Romola just laughs. “All right, all right, we’ll talk next week, and you can tell me all about it.”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nRomola hugs me before she leaves. Somehow I manage to return the hug without stiffening up. Then I walk to the closest subway station and spend a while searching on my smartphone until I find an app that will tell me how to get to any address via public transit.\n\nFor the record: the New York subway is even more disgusting than Bay Area Rapid Transit. I didn’t think that was possible. It’s faster, though, because within ten minutes I’m staring up at the high-rise apartment building where I apparently live. A uniformed man at the door smiles at me. “Miss Caine. Welcome back. How was your day?”\n\nThat must be the doorman. “Great, thanks,” I manage to say before ducking inside; it doesn’t look like any more conversation is required.\n\nApartment 28G ought to be on the twenty-eighth floor, so I head up in the elevator. As I walk toward the apartment door, I hear the faint strains of “Here Comes the Sun” in the hallway, and I grin. Dad’s home.\n\nI walk into an apartment that’s even smaller than the house we had in the poverty-stricken war dimension—but unlike that place, this is immediately recognizable as our home. A houseplant hangs from a hook in one corner, with its long vines trailing along the tops of the windowsills. Piles of books and papers sit on the table and in the corners. The walls are painted a sunshiny yellow, and on the leather sofa sits my father, laptop on his knees, typing away.\n\n“There you are,” Mom says, as Dad glances my way just long enough to smile. She walks out of what must be her bedroom wearing a dark blue sheath dress—simple enough, but pretty fancy for someone who normally sticks to jeans and threadbare sweaters. Head tilted, she puts on an earring as she says, “I didn’t think you’d make it back before dinner.”\n\n“Here I am. Hey, you look nice.”\n\nMom sighs. “I don’t want Josie to think we’re not taking this seriously.”\n\n“I only wish I could believe she wasn’t taking this seriously,” Dad says without looking up from his computer. “Honestly. After only two months?”\n\n“Now, Henry. We made up our minds after less than a day.” My mother rests one hand on my father’s shoulder, and he closes his laptop to smile at her. She continues, “The speed of their courtship isn’t the issue. Or it wouldn’t be, if I had a stronger sense of who he is. But—there’s something elusive about him. Something hidden. I don’t like it.”\n\n“Tonight’s our chance to question him,” Dad says. “Don’t think I don’t intend to make use of it, no matter how la-di-da this restaurant is.”\n\n“You sound like a police investigator going after a suspect.” Mom leans down and kisses his forehead. “Good.”\n\nThe dots aren’t difficult to connect. Josie’s dating someone seriously—Romola’s boss, from the sound of it. This isn’t as remarkable to me as the fact that Josie’s either engaged to him or about to be. Normally my sister seems to go for quantity over quality with her boyfriends; she’s not a party animal or anything, but lots of guys love the same adrenaline sports she does, so she meets someone new all the time. Josie always swore she’d only get serious about a guy after she had some idea where she’d end up, professionally speaking. I don’t want to sacrifice my dreams for anybody, she said once. And I don’t want him to have to sacrifice his dreams for me. That’s kind of hard core—but that’s Josie.\n\nHere, however, some guy won her over in just two months? This man I have to see.\n\n“How long until we leave?” I ask.\n\nDad says, “Thirty minutes or so. I ought to grade a few more midterms, shouldn’t I? Say no.”\n\n“Yes,” Mom calls from her room. Dad sighs.\n\nI find my room on the first try—and exhale in relief as I see my paintings on the walls. My style here is much the same as at home: very realistic, except for my use of color. Here, I stick to a muted, limited palette for each portrait, giving the finished work a definite mood. Josie’s picture glows with reds and pinks; Mom’s reflects cerebral silvers and blues; Dad’s has soft sunny golds; and . . . then there’s Theo.\n\nFor his portrait I used bronze, orange, burnt sienna—colors both grounded and yet somehow electric. His dark eyes seem to shine as he looks out from his picture.\n\nI don’t see a portrait of Paul.\n\nFrustrated, I run a search on my tablet. “Paul Markov, physicist” comes up with zero results. So does “Paul Markov, scientist.”\n\nMy fear comes rushing back. Wouldn’t Paul be a scientist in any world he possibly could? In a dimension so much like our own, wouldn’t he go into physics, just like before? It seems as if nothing could keep him from that destiny, unless he’s seriously ill, or his parents never emigrated from Russia.\n\nHow am I supposed to find him if he’s in Russia? Over there, his name is so common he might as well be called John Smith. Besides, how would I even get there?\n\nI try again, with his name and his birthday. Then an image shows up—something from a school webpage, some years old now—but I smile as I see it. That kid in a plaid shirt, surely no more than ten years old: I’d know him anywhere. Paul doesn’t keep any photos from his childhood, so I’ve never seen him as a little boy before. Of course he was completely adorable. My fingers trace over the screen, outlining his baby face."

        "content": "Then I realize that the school is one here in New York City, and I laugh out loud in relief.\n\nEncouraged, I search a little more online. He doesn’t have a Twitter account or anything like that, but he doesn’t in my world either. None of the universities list him as a student. He doesn’t seem to participate in any of the rock-climbing or hiking clubs I can find in the area either.\n\nFinally I locate a Facebook page, which is set to private. The one photo I can see shows him from the side, looking away from the camera; it’s like Paul clipped the image from the background of a photo of someone or something else. Bad as the picture is, I’d recognize him anywhere—even here, when he’s wearing a tailored leather jacket that seems entirely unlike anything he’d own. Same gray eyes; same broad shoulders. I look closer, seeking that lost, lonely expression that always touches me—but the shadows in the picture render his face unreadable.\n\nIt’s easy for me to imagine this picture as an image of the Paul from the Warverse; something about the lines of the leather jacket reminds me of his military uniform. His stricken face as Theo and I walked away . . . I hurt him so much, giving him hope and then crushing it. Maybe I had no other choice; maybe the situation worked out for the best. Doesn’t make it any easier to think about wounding Paul after Paul, in world after world.\n\nTry not to screw it up this time, I tell myself.\n\nEasier said than done. Without any school or job listed for Paul, I have no way of arranging an accidental meeting. Somehow, I have to get him to reach out to me.\n\nInspiration strikes, and I open a quick Facebook message to Paul. After chewing on my bottom lip for a moment, I type: Hey, we’ve never met, but we have mutual friends.\n\nAlternate versions of him in other dimensions count as “mutual friends,” right?\n\nBasically, everyone says you and I should meet sometime. So how about this week? We could get together—\n\nWhere? I don’t know New York City very well yet. But I know where my parents teach without even having to ask. Growing up surrounded by physics grad students means you’re constantly looking over postdoc applications to the best schools in the world.\n\n—on the Columbia campus and grab a coffee, if you wanted. Hope this is the right Paul Markov. If it’s not, sorry for the mistake!\n\nThat works. Even if Paul’s not intrigued by the idea of the blindest blind date of all time, he’ll probably write back, if only to ask which one of his friends is trying to set him up. Then I’ll keep the messages coming, ask a few casual questions that will tell me something about this world’s Paul, and I can use that information to find him.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe he’d like the idea of a blind date.\n\nI hug my knees to my chest, but my smile fades as I remind myself of my other reason for being here. Wyatt Conley didn’t send me to this dimension to look Paul up for a latte. Not even to retrieve the next splinter of Paul’s soul.\n\nHe sent me here to betray my parents, and this time, I can’t take the risk of faking it. This time, I hurt them for real.\n\nMy dark errand weighs heavily on me as the three of us ride down in the elevator, on our way to eat dinner with Josie and the guy in her life. Apparently we’re being treated to someplace fancy, because normally my father would never wear a tie for anything less than a wedding, a funeral, or a pitch meeting for a big research grant.\n\n“We should’ve insisted on picking the restaurant,” Dad says during the taxi ride across Central Park. “The Vietnamese place around the corner, maybe. We’d all be more relaxed, and ten-to-one I’d like the food better.”\n\n“If he’s treating, then logically he should be the one to determine the restaurant.” Mom looks out the car window at the darkening sky above. Day has begun fading into night. “We learn about people by observing their choices, Henry. The more control we surrender in this situation, the more we’ll learn about him.”\n\nI’m wedged between the two of them in the middle of the backseat of the cab, with some obnoxious taxi-only TV channel playing on the same screen my knees are jammed against. “How much farther is it?”\n\n“No idea,” Dad grumbles. “Never bothered going anyplace so ritzy in my life, and my great-uncle was a viscount, you know.”\n\nMom smiles. “Look at it this way, Henry. Now we know where to take Susannah the next time she visits Manhattan.”\n\nI feel a completely illogical leap of surprise at the news that Aunt Susannah—dead in the Warverse—is alive and well here. And of course they need to take her to the fanciest restaurant in New York. The more pretentious and overpriced something is, the greater chance Aunt Susannah will love it. I manage to hold back a giggle, but barely.\n\nBut being with my parents while they’re acting like themselves—dorky and silly and so crazy about each other it’s almost embarrassing—that only makes it more difficult to think of the task ahead.\n\nI hug myself and shrink down farther in the seat.\n\nThe restaurant turns out to border Central Park. It’s located in a stately, cream-colored building from the 1910s, one that doesn’t proclaim its status so much as it quietly suggests it. As we walk to the front door, I see someone standing nearby, waiting; when he turns, I recognize Theo.\n\n“Hey,” I call. I’m about to lift my hand to wave when it hits me: What if Theo’s here because he’s Josie’s fiancé?\n\nThat’s crazy. They’ve never seemed like more than friends, not ever, even if he is closer to her age than mine. But this is a new dimension, with new rules. Is that why he’s in my phone contacts? Because I’ve made friends with my future brother-in-law?\n\nThen Mom smiles at him. “Theo. So glad you could make it.”\n\n“Glad to be here,” Theo says. I can tell he’s winging it, trying to figure out how well he knows my parents in this dimension.\n\nThe answer comes as Dad slaps him on the shoulder. “You needed to take a break from your dissertation—and besides, we’ll need an objective point of view. Nobody we’d trust more than you.”\n\nTheo gets that oh crap I have no idea what they’re talking about look. So I provide an assist, saying, “We can’t let Josie marry just anybody, you know.”\n\nHe visibly stifles a laugh, as astonished as I am at the thought of commitment-phobic Josie getting engaged. My parents don’t see; they’re already walking inside. Once again, Theo crooks his arm for me, and I take it. He whispers, “Seen Paul?”\n\nOnly on a computer screen. I shake my head. Explaining my plan will have to wait for later.\n\nWe enter a hushed space, so carefully lit and perfectly decorated in cream and gold that I’d know it was crazy expensive even if Dad hadn’t told me already. The carpet beneath my shoes feels as plush as if I were walking on clouds. Theo uses his free hand to straighten his mega-ironic ’80s tie with the piano keys on it; this place is fancy enough to make even him self-conscious.\n\nIn the corner Josie rises from her seat to greet us. She’s wearing flowing silk pants and a cowl-necked sweater—which, despite their elegance, still look like something my sister would choose to wear. So Josie’s herself here, I think—and then I stop short. Theo sucks in a sharp breath as we see who’s by her side—\n\n—my sister’s fiancé, Wyatt Conley."

        "content": "14\n\nJOSIE TAKES CONLEY’S ARM, HER FACE GLOWING. “EVERYONE, this is Wyatt. And Wyatt, may I present my parents, Dr. Sophia Kovalenka and Dr. Henry Caine; plus my sister, Marguerite; and my parents’ graduate assistant, Theo Beck.”\n\n“A pleasure to meet you, Dr. Kovalenka, Dr. Caine. And Marguerite and Theo. I’m so glad you could make it tonight.” Conley’s manners are better than usual. If I didn’t know what a manipulative, power-hungry snake he actually is, I could believe my sister had gotten engaged to a nice guy.\n\nAs my parents get through some small talk with the “happy couple,” Theo and I take our seats. I lean toward him and whisper, “What’s Conley doing?”\n\n“From this angle, I can see what your parents can’t see, namely that he’s letting your sister grope his ass.”\n\nSomehow I manage not to gag. “I mean, why is he going after Josie? What’s his game? And if Conley’s got such a good in with my family in this dimension, why did he send us here?”\n\nTheo raises an eyebrow. “Now that’s a good question.”\n\nI look carefully at Conley, studying his neck and chest in particular. He’s wearing a suit, one that’s not closely tailored, so it still fits his “Bad Boy Wonder of Silicon Valley” image—but the subtle sheen of the fabric makes it clear his jacket alone probably cost as much as some cars. What interests me most is the lack of any rumples or wrinkles along his shirt, no telltale bulge beneath his silk necktie.\n\nHe’s not wearing a Firebird.\n\nConley wouldn’t necessarily have to wear it at all times; once you’ve stabilized in a dimension, you can take the Firebird off and put it aside almost indefinitely. But I’ve never removed my Firebird for more than a couple of seconds when I didn’t absolutely have to, and neither would anyone else traveling through the multiverse.\n\nBesides, he showed no flicker of recognition when he saw us. Conley loves to lord his power over people, to show off when he’s got the advantage. So my guess is that we’re sitting down to dinner with this world’s Wyatt Conley—no passengers from other dimensions involved.\n\nThat would mean his romance with Josie is for real.\n\nEveryone settles in. I hesitate before unfolding my napkin, which has been done up into some kind of origami swan. This tablecloth is made out of better fabric than most of my clothes. And when the waiter gives us the menus—gliding in and out almost unnoticeably, like a spirit—no prices are listed.\n\nTheo murmurs, “If you have to ask, you can’t afford it.”\n\nI’d laugh, but I’m too busy watching Conley and Josie.\n\n“Well, I told you, Wyatt and I met when I agreed to help with his latest gaming system.” Josie beams. Since when did she get into programming? Her next sentence answers that question. “The company needed someone to surf in a wave pool, so they could study the body kinesthetic, the kinds of motion, all of that. They’d already had a guy come in, but when they advertised for a female surfer too, I figured, what the hell. I’d been wanting to visit the Bay Area again, and I thought I might as well get paid for doing what I’d do for fun on the weekend anyway.”\n\nConley cuts in. “And I was there just to see how the project was getting on.”\n\n“You had time for that?” Dad says, amiably enough. He’s the only one of us totally at ease in these sophisticated surroundings—well, aside from Conley himself. My father’s English-nobility background is showing. “I’d think running ConTech would keep you far too busy for that sort of thing.”\n\nI make a mental note. His company isn’t Triad here; it’s ConTech.\n\n“I’m a busy man,” Conley admits. “But I try to look in on various projects and teams throughout my company from time to time.”\n\n“Keeping them on their toes, huh?” Theo says.\n\nThat earns him a look from Conley, who clearly isn’t sure why the grad assistant feels free to snark at him. But Conley keeps going. “Whatever made me show up that afternoon, I’m grateful. Because the minute I saw Josie surfing—she looked so happy, so confident, like she was having the time of her life—well, I guess that’s why they call it love at first sight.”\n\nOh, vomit.\n\n“You know how I am,” Josie says. She’s speaking to all of us, supposedly, but she’s looking at Mom. “I never wanted to be held back, and I never wanted to hold anyone back. Wyatt—he’s already accomplished so much. I couldn’t keep him from his goals. I’m not sure that’s even possible.”\n\nConley smiles as he puts one hand around her shoulders, not quite an embrace. His eyes flicker away only briefly, as he gestures to the waiter.\n\nJosie continues, “I’m not leaving Scripps. I’m still going to get my doctorate in oceanography. And after that, Wyatt’s talked about funding an expedition to Antarctica, where I could work on the iron content research we talked about, Dad.”\n\n“Really? What sort of methodology have you chosen?” Dad perks up. He’s never regretted leaving oceanography for pure mathematics, putting aside his own promising career to support Mom in hers—but he’s still a huge nerd about it.\n\nThe waiter arrives with champagne. With a nod of her head, Mom lets the waiter know he can pour me a glass as well. Special occasion, et cetera. She and Dad won’t touch a drop, though. They don’t drink much, and besides—despite the smile on Mom’s face, and all my father’s excited questions, I can tell they’re analyzing Wyatt Conley every single second.\n\nI take a sip, mostly to cover my own discomfort with the situation. Under his breath, Theo says, “I think Conley means it.”\n\nAbout loving Josie, he’s saying. “This one does,” I mutter. “That doesn’t mean another one wouldn’t use this to his advantage.” Theo nods.\n\nThe rest of the night has a hallucinatory quality—half dream, half nightmare. For the dream, we have the hush of the room, the cloudlike elegance of the space, and food that tastes like the stuff you get served in heaven, in most world religions. For the nightmare: Conley’s hand in Josie’s, or around her shoulder, all evening long, holding tight. Like he owns her.\n\nYet I can’t deny the energy they have together. Josie laughs when she tells her story about teaching him to water-ski; he lights up when he talks about how she gets him to stop thinking about business all the time and actually enjoy his life. And I notice the compliments he pays her. Conley never calls her beautiful, or sweet, or any of those generic terms that actually don’t have jack to do with my rough-and-tumble sister. He says Josie’s dynamic. That she’s filled with purpose. Above all, she is strong.\n\nI have to admit: He knows the real Josie. Maybe he even really loves her.\n\nSilently I decide to stop thinking of this one as “Conley” and instead think of him as “Wyatt.” That doesn’t mean I trust Wyatt—not even close—but it reminds me that he’s not the same guy as the one who’s kidnapped and traumatized my family. I have to evaluate this one on his own.\n\nDessert arrives in the form of sorbets in flavors I’ve never heard of before: green tea, crème brûlée, even beet-and-lime. Tentatively I sample the beet-and-lime one—which is actually pretty good—then nearly choke on it when Wyatt says, “So where are you with the Firebird project?”"

        "content": "Next to me, Theo coughs into his napkin, trying to pretend he didn’t just aspirate his dessert. Mom seems to think it’s a natural question. “Not yet at the point of building a prototype, but I think we’re ready to start construction soon.”\n\n“Depending on funding,” Wyatt says, and Josie squeezes his fingers. I can tell what’s coming next—the offer, the blank check he’s ready to sign. The power he’s about to seize over my parents’ research.\n\nThen Dad surprises me. “Josie’s been hinting about this for a couple of weeks now, but I’m pleased to say that help is unnecessary. We just found out yesterday that we’ve been approved for a grant that ought to cover our next three years of research.”\n\nThis is Wyatt’s cue to start trying to talk my parents into letting him provide the funding. Instead, he grins and shakes his head. “I can see I’m going to have to invest at the IPO, like everyone else.”\n\n“IPO,” Mom scoffs gently. “We’re not doing this to make a profit, Wyatt. We only want to prove what’s possible. To see some fraction of the infinite dimensions layered within the multiverse.”\n\nJosie murmurs, “Like climbing a mountain just because it’s there.”\n\n“Do people climb mountains for any other reason?” Dad says. He gives Theo a look. “However, our assistant here thinks more like you do. His rationale is that if we can bring back advanced technology from alternate dimensions, we should—and in that case, money’s going to be made and we might as well be the ones to make it. Right, Theo?”\n\n“Yeah. I mean, yes, that’s what I’ve always said. But lately I’ve wondered whether you and Sophia aren’t right after all.” Theo looks past us, at memories instead of the here and now. “Maybe the answer matters more than the reward.”\n\nMy mother takes Theo’s hand. “You’re getting philosophical on us.”\n\n“Hardly.” He manages to grin. “You know the old joke—a philosophy major winds up on the street with a sign that says WILL THINK FOR FOOD.”\n\nEverybody laughs, and the dinner tapers off into ordinary chitchat, like what everyone thinks of the sorbet, and Dad’s token attempt to wrest the check from Wyatt. When we walk out into the night, I’m struck by the halved sky above me—to my right, Central Park’s tall leafy trees are blacker than the sky above, and to the left, tall buildings reach upward, every window a sort of lantern. I think I’d like New York, if I ever got to visit for normal reasons.\n\nMy parents take it for granted that Josie’s going to the hotel suite she shares with Wyatt, which I didn’t. It’s not like I didn’t guess that if they were engaged, they’d probably had sex, but that doesn’t make me any happier to think about it. They stroll off alongside the park, enjoying a romantic evening in the big city.\n\nConley could get to my family here any time he wanted to, I think. All he’d have to do is travel here, take over “Wyatt” for a few hours and he’d be done. So why hasn’t he?\n\nI begin putting together a plan.\n\nAs the four of us stand there near the front of the restaurant, my mother’s hand outstretched for a cab, Dad says, “I have to admit—she’s happy.”\n\n“She is, and yet”—Mom shakes her head—“am I questioning it only because it seems too good to be true?”\n\n“That’s not like you,” I say. “You should trust your instincts.”\n\nShe gives me a look—questioning, but not disapproving. “What do your instincts tell you, Marguerite?”\n\nHow do I answer this? I can’t let on how much I know; certainly I can’t tell them the truth, not when I have to sabotage their work tomorrow. “I think he really loves her, but—something about it—I guess it all seems too easy.”\n\n“Yes, that’s it.” Mom combs her fingers through my curls, like she used to do when I was little and she helped me to go back to sleep after a bad dream. “We’ll have to see. Of course, in the end, it’s Josie’s choice to make.”\n\n“Still, worth checking out,” Theo says. “So. I ought to get going.”\n\n“You mean, we should get going.” I improvise as smoothly as I can. “There’s this really cool performance-art piece happening downtown tonight, in about an hour. Theo said he’d take me if I wanted to go. It’s okay with you guys, right?”\n\nMy parents exchange a look. They’ve always been pretty chill, but my heading out into the wee hours is a little over their boundary lines. Of course, I’ll have Theo with me—and apparently they’re not sure what to make of that. Does that mean we’ve never flirted in this universe?\n\nOr does it mean that we have?\n\nRegardless, after a moment, Mom nods. “I realize not all art hangs in galleries. But text us when you get there and when you’re leaving, and wake us up when you get in.”\n\n“And you’ll see her all the way back to our building, Theo,” Dad chimes in.\n\n“Absolutely.” Theo grins, hands in his pockets, like these had been his plans for the evening all along.\n\nA bright yellow taxi finally sidles up to the curb for my mom and dad. As soon as it pulls off, Theo says, “This had better not be about real performance art. Because no.”\n\nI give him a look. “No. We’re going to Josie and Wyatt’s hotel.”\n\n“Thrilled as I am to hear you inviting me to a hotel, I bet you’re going in a different direction with this.”\n\nMy cheeks flush with heat as I remember Theo and me in the hotel in San Francisco, and the way he rolled me over, kissed me passionately. Thank goodness it’s too dark for Theo to see my blush. “Conley hasn’t come to this dimension. He can’t have, or else he would have taken care of the sabotage himself.”\n\n“Sure. But this world’s Wyatt Conley isn’t going to know anything about that.”\n\n“No, but—he’s a genius, right? In every dimension. And he might not be involved in the research about dimensional travel, but he’s smart enough to understand it. If this version really loves Josie . . .” Still so weird to think about that, but I’ve begun to believe in his feelings for her. “. . . then maybe he could help us figure out why Conley didn’t come to this world.”\n\nTheo frowns as we begin to stroll in the same direction Josie and Wyatt went. “Wait,” he says. “You want to tell this version of Wyatt Conley the truth? Because that is risky as hell.”\n\n“The worst that could happen is Wyatt deciding we’re nuts.”\n\n“No, the worst thing that could happen is Conley actually showing up in this universe, finding out we’re trying to work against him, and retaliating by splintering Paul’s soul into a thousand pieces instead of only four.”\n\nInstinctively I raise my hand to cover the two Firebirds hanging beneath my dress, next to my skin. A thousand dimensions—including some where we live on different continents, where reaching Paul would be nearly impossible—I could spend the rest of my life chasing him. Hunting for him. Reassembling the essential soul of the guy I love, bit by bit.\n\nIf I had to, then I would.\n\nBut I won’t. “No,” I insist. “If Conley were ever coming here, he would have done it already. He wouldn’t have sent us. That’s all there is to it. And if there’s something unique about this dimension that keeps him out—”"

        "content": "“Then it would keep us out too,” Theo says.\n\n“Well, okay. But still, there’s something here we’re missing. Wyatt is the only person with any chance of helping us figure out what that is.” I take a deep breath as I resume walking. “Except Mom and Dad. But we can’t tell them.”\n\n“Because we still might have to saw them off at the knees.” Theo says it dully. “Moving on. Found this dimension’s Paul yet? I went through the whole Columbia student directory, and nada. He could be at Cambridge—”\n\n“He’s in New York. I don’t know what he’s doing besides grad school, but he’s here. I sent him a Facebook message saying mutual friends wanted to fix us up.” I take my phone out of my leather backpack to check it. But the Facebook app has nothing more to offer me than a lot of FarmVille updates. Apparently I’m really into FarmVille here. Kind of sad. “He’ll write back. Probably.” Maybe I should have put up a hotter profile pic.\n\nBut Theo says, “Of course he’ll write. He’ll be freaked out as hell, but you know Paul. He can’t stand having incomplete data.”\n\n“You’re right. He’ll have to know.” The thought soothes my raw nerves. I’ll find Paul here; it won’t be much longer. Another day, or maybe two. I can handle that.\n\n“So,” Theo says. “Josie and Wyatt Conley. There’s not enough WTF in the world.”\n\n“Nope. But at least we know where Conley’s vulnerable.”\n\n“You think that’s true at home too? I mean, come on. They hardly know each other there.”\n\nTrue. Yet I can’t forget how Josie’s always joked that she thought Wyatt Conley was hot; maybe she wasn’t joking. And now that I think about it, Conley’s always managed to avoid meeting Josie face-to-face. Before it simply seemed unlucky. Now I can’t help wondering if he avoided her on purpose because he knew she was a weakness he couldn’t afford.\n\nSlowly, I nod. “Yeah, I do.”\n\nTheo shrugs. His hipster-tight jacket crumples a bit at his shoulders, but that’s all part of the look. “That’s going to make for some interesting investigations back home. But for tonight, we try to talk with Conley about this without coming across as total lunatics. Tomorrow—I guess we go ahead and load the virus into your parents’ data.”\n\nAlthough my heart aches, I can’t think of another way to successfully fake that sabotage. “Yeah, we’d better.”\n\nIf I told my parents the truth, they might help us; probably they’d play along just to stop anyone from attempting to dominate the dimensions. But I’m still heartsick to think that we didn’t really carry out Conley’s plan in the Warverse. I offered Paul that deal because we had no other choice, which means there’s always a chance Conley will figure out the truth. If he does, God only knows what will happen to Paul.\n\nI can’t take that chance again. No, this time we have to play by Conley’s rules.\n\nFinally we approach the hotel Josie mentioned. Its brilliant sign glows gold in the night, at least two stories high. “Looks pretty swanky,” Theo says, gesturing at the twin waterfalls on either side of the front door.\n\n“Like Conley would stay anywhere else,” I sigh. “Come on, let’s—”\n\nI hear the shriek of brakes just behind me, and whirl around, expecting to see a cabdriver getting into an accident. Instead, a black van runs up onto the curb before it skids to a halt.\n\nTwo men garbed in black, including ski masks that cover their faces, jump out and run in my direction—and I realize the person in trouble here is me.\n\nTheo doesn’t even hesitate. He charges, only to have one of the guys slam a fist into the side of Theo’s head. Instantly he crumples to the sidewalk.\n\nI turn to run, but a hand closes around my arm as tight as a vise. Even as I twist away, trying to scramble out of his grasp, someone else hoists me over his shoulder. I scream as loud as I can, which is when a black bag covers my head.\n\n“Help!” I shriek. Someone’s got to hear me through the bag, right? I try kicking at my captor, but he’s running—and then there’s a dizzying kind of spin as he throws me into the van. I kick out with both feet, going for the bag with my hands, but my arms are yanked down, and someone very heavy sits on my legs. Oh God, oh God, what’s happening?\n\nI hear Theo shout, “Marguerite! What— Police! POLICE!”\n\nThe van door slams shut, and my blood turns to ice.\n\nI’m being kidnapped. Abducted. Taken against my will.\n\nAgain I scream, wordlessly, but it does no good. We accelerate so fast that I roll over and hit the side of the van, and once again, tires squeal against asphalt. I feel a plastic zip tie tighten around my wrists, and then someone does my legs. Thrashing, I try to shake off the bag, but two large hands push my shoulders down onto the floor of the van.\n\n“Listen to me,” says a heavily accented voice. “You get that bag off, you see our faces. You see our faces, you don’t get to go home again. Maybe you like that bag now, huh?”\n\nI hate the bag. But I’m keeping it on.\n\nMy heart pounds so hard it feels like my chest will crack. Tears well in my eyes, and I’m so scared I think I’m going to wet my pants.\n\nNever let them take you to a second location. That’s what all the self-defense classes say. It doesn’t matter if someone holds a gun on you, you do not let them take you to a second location, because if they’d kill you where you stand, they’ll kill you wherever you’re going, except they’ll have control of you for hours or days before you die, and you Do. Not. Want. That.\n\nWill they rape me? Will they kill me? My mind seems to have shattered into something that can only show me the thousand horrible things that might be about to happen. That are probably going to happen. All the dangers of traveling through dimensions, and yet I never thought about how the same dangers from my own world might be the ones that killed me.\n\nThe Firebird, I remind myself. You’ve got the Firebirds. If I can manage to touch it at some point, even with my wrists bound, I might be able to leap out of here. But then that leaves this Marguerite to suffer a terrible fate—and means Wyatt Conley might decide I’d broken our deal. What would happen to Paul then?\n\nPaul wouldn’t want me to get hurt for his sake. I know that. But I’m not leaving him behind in this universe unless I have no other choice.\n\nIt seems like we drive forever. The van bumps and jostles me constantly, even though the guys continue holding me down; they talk the whole time, in what I’m increasingly sure is Russian, but in a dialect I’m not familiar with. Maybe my weeks in St. Petersburg will kick back in, and help me to understand them a little. All I know for sure is that we go over a bridge—the rhythmic thump-and-click unmistakable—and then keep driving for a long time more.\n\nWhen the van comes to a halt, my pulse intensifies to the point where my chest hurts. I might be about to throw up. I don’t want to throw up in the bag. My brain seizes on that—don’t puke, don’t puke—because it seems like the only part of this I might be able to control. Once again, I’m hauled over someone’s shoulder and carried down a short set of stairs. Metal doors swing shut behind us; I hear locks being turned.\n\nThis isn’t some random vacant lot or warehouse. This is a space designed to be secure, and secret. Oh, my God, is this human trafficking or something?"

        "content": "I’m dumped into a chair. The unpleasant screech of duct tape accompanies the pressure of it being wrapped around me, keeping me in place. If I knew what they wanted, I’d beg, I’d bargain—\n\nThen it hits me. Maybe this isn’t random.\n\nA criminal operation—a professional one—that could be run by someone with a lot of money. A lot of influence. Someone who could get others to do his dirty work.\n\nBut no, I tell myself. He’s in love with my sister—for real, I’m sure of it. Conley wouldn’t do this, unless—unless he realized I suspected him—\n\n“We’ve got her,” says the man just by my shoulder.\n\nSomeone responds: “I see that.” Only three words, but I recognize his voice.\n\nBecause it’s Paul.\n\n15\n\nI CAN’T SPEAK. CAN’T SWALLOW. CAN’T BLINK.\n\nThe unbearable terror of the past hour expands, explodes. Every thought I have vaporizes. Nothing remains but the hard truth: Paul kidnapped me.\n\nWho is he in this world? How can he be a part of this?\n\nI hear him take one step closer, as if he’s approaching. Yet he speaks to the others in the room instead. “She’s just a girl. I checked. She’s not even as old as I am.”\n\n“Leonid said to pick her up if we had the chance,” says one of them—the one who grabbed me, I think. From the sharper diction of his words, I can tell he’s pulled off the ski mask; I hope he stays behind me, because I don’t want to see his face. I can’t see his face. “We got the chance.”\n\nPaul swears under his breath; I remember enough Russian to know he’s angry. Furious.\n\nAnd I’m not the one he’s angry with.\n\nHe didn’t mean for this to happen. That has to be it. Someone else, this Leonid person—that’s who kidnapped me. Paul’s mixed up with some seriously terrible people, all right, but apparently he never meant for me to be hurt.\n\nBesides, a splinter of my Paul’s soul is within him. The guy I love is in there, just beneath the surface. I tell myself that he’s influencing this Paul’s actions. Playing a part in his decisions. My Paul will protect me.\n\nSo this will turn out okay. He’ll get me out of this. And now I have the chance I need to retrieve the next piece of Paul’s soul. But the terror of the past hour will take a long time to subside. My breaths come shallow and fast, my ribs straining against the duct tape every time I inhale.\n\nHe comes closer, and I feel his hand tug at the bottom of the black sack over my head. One of the men says, sharply, “What are you doing?”\n\nPaul says, “The rest of you stay behind her. She already knows what I look like.”\n\nThen he lifts the edge of the bag. In the first instant, the light seems overwhelmingly bright—but my eyes adjust, revealing a dimly lit basement, and Paul standing in front of me. He’s no monstrous version of himself, amused at my terror or eager to be cruel. Instead, he looks at me with much the same expression my own Paul would have in this kind of situation: worried for me, angry with my kidnappers, and determined to find the best way out.\n\nReally, the only different thing about him is the clothing. Even if Paul could afford a slim-cut leather jacket like that, he’d never wear such a thing. Designer jeans, either. The outfit suits him, though, in a strange way.\n\n“You’ve put us in a difficult position,” Paul says to my abductors, then goes silent again, obviously thinking hard.\n\nAnalyze your surroundings, I tell myself. My terror-fogged brain clears as I focus on each element in turn. The chill of this room. Cement floor, with a drain at the center. Cinderblock walls. Pipes and some rebar stretch along the ceiling, confirming my earlier instinct that this was a basement. While the rest of the guys remain out of sight, I can see their shadows reflected on the floor. The swinging light overhead distorts their shapes, but I can tell all of them are as big and bulky as the men who abducted me.\n\nAs for Paul—I now notice he’s been inked, a few blue-black lines apparent at the open collar of his shirt. It seems so incredibly unlike him to get a tattoo. His light brown hair is combed back and slicked with something that makes it seem darker. But he is still, fundamentally, the same.\n\n“None of you have ever seen her before?” Paul glances around the room; nobody speaks. Finally he addresses me. “Who are these mutual friends?”\n\nMy mouth is so dry from fear that I have to swallow before I can say, “What are you talking about?”\n\n“Your message.” The dry humor in his voice is familiar. “You said mutual friends thought we should go out.”\n\n“Obviously I had the wrong Paul Markov.”\n\nPaul remains suspicious. “Did Tarasov tell you to make contact?”\n\n“Who?” I can’t remember a Tarasov from any dimension.\n\nHis frown deepens. “Derevko, then. Or Quinteros?”\n\n“I don’t know who any of those people are. Is this—is this because of that Facebook message?” Who the hell attacks someone because they messaged them on Facebook? “Like I told you, I made a mistake.”\n\nPaul inclines his head, like It’s possible. Obviously he’s still unhappy with the situation, but not . . . shocked. How can he not be shocked? These guys showed up with a kidnap victim. Namely, me.\n\nThis is obviously a criminal organization. I mean, they had a van, people watching me, waiting to see if they could kidnap me, all because I tried to get in touch with Paul in the most innocuous way, plus none of the others seem to have been born in the United States and holy crap I’m mixed up with the Russian mob.\n\nHow did Paul get mixed up with them?\n\nHe steps farther back, as if to study me from a distance, then leans against the cinder-block wall, like he’s completely at ease.\n\nBut he’s not. The tension in the way he holds his shoulders might be invisible to anyone who didn’t know Paul as I well as I do. Deep inside, he’s unsure of himself. Questioning what to do next.\n\nI cling to this scrap of knowledge the way I’d grab a life preserver in the ocean. Is that uncertainty part of this world’s Paul, or the soul of my Paul coming through? It doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is I know this man.\n\n“Listen,” I say, as calmly as I can. Paul responds to logic. “You said you researched me. So you know I’m eighteen years old, I live with my parents, and I’m not mixed up in . . . in whatever you guys are mixed up in.” Time for a little creative invention. “Some friends of mine told me about a Paul Markov. Actually, now that I think about it, maybe I got the last name wrong. Obviously you’re not the person I was looking for.”\n\nPaul inclines his head slightly. “Persuasive,” he says. That’s not the same as I believe you, but it’s a positive sign.\n\n“She knows your name, and she’s seen your face,” says one of the guys standing behind me, and the fear inside me once again boils over into panic. Every trashy true-crime TV show I ever watched has made it clear that they never let you see their face unless they plan to kill you, and while Paul would never do that, I don’t feel good about the others—i.e., the guys in the room who are bigger, and stronger, and who probably own guns.\n\nYet they seem to defer to Paul.\n\nQuietly he says, “The police would investigate the murder of a young woman from the Upper West Side. They wouldn’t care very much about a kidnapping that resulted in no injury. Probably they wouldn’t even believe any abduction took place; they’d think it was a story she made up. Cover for sneaking out to a party, maybe.”"

        "content": "“There was a guy with her,” grunts one of the men behind me. “We knocked him down. Out, maybe. Didn’t have time to handle him permanently.”\n\nTheo. By now he will have phoned the police, my parents, everyone. They must all be so scared.\n\nPaul says, “Then we don’t have any time to waste. Either we have to get rid of the evidence, or we have to work out a deal.” He steps closer to me. “I don’t want police attention. How can I best avoid it, Miss Caine? By eliminating you as a witness, or by setting you free to tell the police you have no idea what happened to you?”\n\n“Option two,” I say. “Definitely.”\n\n“You can’t trust her to do that!” objects one of the goons.\n\n“I don’t think she’s stupid,” Paul says. “She knows that if we found her once, we could find her again. The police might take me in for questioning, but by now she knows I have many friends. Don’t you, Miss Caine?”\n\n“All I want to do is get out of here.” But not too quickly. “You’ll drop me off? Don’t send me with the others. I don’t trust them.”\n\nIf he’s the one who drives me to God knows where, I’ll have a chance to bring the Firebird into contact with his body and rescue that splinter of my Paul’s soul. Then I can leave this dimension. Just leap out of here. Theo’s Firebird will tell him that I’ve left; he’ll follow me to the home office, where we can finally have it out with Conley. And this world’s Marguerite can wonder why the hell she came to on a strange street corner, call her parents or the cops, and go home without suffering anything worse than a few bruises, some confusion, and a nasty rip in her tights.\n\n“She’ll stay quiet,” Paul says to the others. “If she doesn’t—we can remind her of the bargain we’ve struck.”\n\n“Leonid has his ways,” someone behind me says. Which is his way of agreeing with Paul. Even with the duct tape around my chest and arms, I feel like I can breathe better. Within a couple of hours, this will only seem like a bad dream.\n\nLater, I know, I’ll have to question how Paul got mixed up in this—I mean, seriously, the Russian mob? But I can’t think about anything that complicated right now. My mind boils it down to the absolute basics: Stay quiet. Trust Paul. Get home.\n\nBut Paul hasn’t said he’ll be the one to drop me off—\n\nA metal door slams. My entire body tenses so hard the tape pulls tight across my belly and my arms. Heavy footsteps walk through some kind of hallway—slightly behind me—and then I hear a deep, strongly accented voice. “You went fishing, I see.”\n\nWhile all the other men chuckle in a sheepish, brown-nosing kind of way, Paul’s face falls.\n\nI don’t even need anyone to say the name. This is the man in charge. Leonid.\n\nThe footsteps circle around until I can see Leonid himself—still a shadow, mostly, lit from behind. He doesn’t look directly at me; the guy knows better than to show anyone his face. “This is a child. My grandmother could catch this one.”\n\nScrew you too, I think.\n\nBut I know better than to say anything out loud. I’m not even going to look directly at Leonid—see, I can’t identify you, it’s okay to let me go—and I don’t want to draw any more attention. He’s not getting any reaction from me whatsoever—\n\n—until he steps into the light, and I have to bite down on my own tongue to keep from crying out.\n\nNot because he’s shown me his face, and proved he doesn’t care whether I live or die.\n\nBecause the face looking at me now is Paul, through a mirror darkly.\n\nHe’s older—rougher—hair as gray as his eyes—and coarser in every way, as if someone had taken Paul and stripped away everything that makes him beautiful, leaving only the brute behind. The nose has been broken a couple of times; his teeth are yellow from decades of coffee. Yet the resemblance is powerful, and unmistakable.\n\nBehind him, Paul says quietly, “I’m handling this, Papa.”\n\nLeonid is Paul’s father.\n\nThe puzzle pieces snap together at last. This is why Paul never goes home at Thanksgiving or Christmas. Why he doesn’t like his parents, won’t even talk about them. Why he has to get by on a modest grad student stipend, with no help from home ever. Paul’s dad is mixed up in organized crime. The reason they cut him off must be because he refused to join the family business.\n\nExcept in this dimension, Paul stayed. Now he’s trapped in the last possible life he could ever want to lead.\n\n“You’re handling it, are you?” Leonid says to Paul. “You found out who she’s with?”\n\n“No one.” Paul stands almost at attention. I always thought he was awkward with us—because, well, he is. But with his father, he’s even worse. Tense and uncertain. Scared. “The entire situation arose out of a misunderstanding.”\n\n“You believe that?” Leonid’s finger brushes against my cheek, a cold, impersonal appraisal.\n\nPaul nods. “Yes, I do.”\n\nThe guys standing behind me don’t even seem to breathe. I realize they’re nearly as terrified of Leonid as I am. Leonid’s not just in the Russian mob; he’s high up. Very high.\n\nEnough so that he doesn’t care if I see his face or not. He’s too big a fish for the cops to net easily.\n\nLeonid Markov cocks his head, and finally he speaks to me. “You’re a sweet little girl who knows nothing about business? I think maybe you are. You don’t remember any of this, even our names?”\n\nMy entire knowledge of criminal activity comes from Law & Order reruns. Probably not reliable. I stick to what Paul said before. “If I tell the police I don’t remember anything, you won’t come after me again. That’s all I want.”\n\nHe laughs out loud, pats my cheek. “Good girl.”\n\nWas that stupid, persuasive, or both? At any rate, Leonid is out of my face now, standing up and looking at Paul instead. Paul says, “I’ll drop her off myself. Drive her to another borough. It doesn’t have to be any more complicated than that.”\n\nHe speaks so evenly that someone could almost miss the fact that he’s pleading for my life. Joy spreads its wings inside me. Paul’s going to be the one to drive me away from this place. I have a chance at rescuing my Paul’s soul. This will all be over soon.\n\n“You’re right,” Leonid says. “It wouldn’t have to be, if I didn’t have such idiots working for me.”\n\nSilence falls. Danger has become palpable in the room, but suddenly the threat is no longer directed at me.\n\nLeonid steps back. In the harsh light of the single bulb dangling down, the wrinkles on his face cast strange shadows. “Idiots kidnap a girl where people can see them, where they knock down a witness and leave him there to call the police. Idiots kidnap a girl in front of a building with a security camera in the front. Idiots get us on the news!”\n\nAt first my heart leaps at the thought the authorities know I’m in danger—but that’s only instinct. In this situation, instinct is completely wrong. I was out of trouble; Paul had found the way to save me. Now those plans don’t count anymore.\n\nLeonid reaches inside his heavy coat, and something about the way he moves reminds me sharply of Paul. For a moment father and son are superimposed on each other—old over young, corrupt versus good—confusing me enough that at first I don’t recognize the gun."

        "content": "Then it’s as if there’s nothing else in the room. The gun makes everything else invisible, silent, irrelevant. The dull sheen of black metal stands out even in the darkened room. Then my vision focuses even tighter, on Leonid’s hand as he squeezes the trigger.\n\nWhen the sound of the gunshot explodes in the room, I scream—in fear, and in pain, because it’s so loud my eardrums sting and I think they might have ruptured. Then I’m too scared to scream anymore. Through the ringing of my ears I hear a heavy, wet thud on the floor just behind me.\n\nLeonid has one less henchman.\n\nEvery other guy in the room remains completely quiet, like if he shows Leonid enough respect, he won’t be next. Paul is the only one who challenges his father. “What did you do that for?”\n\n“I don’t need idiots.” Leonid slips his gun back under his jacket as casually as I’d put my phone back in my purse. “This wasn’t his first mistake.” His gray eyes—so like Paul’s, yet so much colder—focus on someone else in the corner of the room, probably the other man who kidnapped me. “You—it was your first mistake. So you get another chance. One more. Understand me?”\n\nEven as Paul clenches his jaw, flushed with unspoken anger, he looks toward me. His gaze is a message I think I would understand even if I didn’t know him so well: Don’t react, don’t move, and this won’t happen to you. I won’t let it.\n\n“Clean it up,” Leonid says to his goons as he puts one hand on Paul’s shoulder, the gesture of the warm, loving dad he so obviously isn’t. “Come, Paul. We should talk about what happens next.”\n\nDon’t leave, I think.\n\nBut he has to bargain with his father, probably for my life. I force myself to remain calm as father and son walk away, and the heavy metal door behind me swings shut again.\n\nMen grumble in colloquial Russian I can’t quite catch as they remove their dead or dying comrade. I only glean a few words—trash, hurry, silent. Why didn’t I study harder after I got back from my first trip? I’d gotten so good at Russian then, and I wish I spoke it fluently now. At my feet, I see a trickle of blood oozing toward the metal grid in the center of the room. With a rush of horror, I realize this is what the drain is for.\n\nFinally I have to let the fear take me. A strange immobility sinks over me, and I know my expression has gone totally blank. This must be the way rabbits or deer feel when they see headlights coming on the highway. This is why they stand perfectly still as death rushes toward them.\n\nAll I can do is sit in this chair, feeling duct tape tight against my ribs, stealing my breath. My body shakes—trying to burn off the adrenaline shot into my blood so I could fight or flee. I can do neither.\n\nI zone out. Time blurs. I am bound to this chair forever and for only a second before the metal door clangs again. My stomach clenches as I brace myself for Leonid—but when I see Paul, I can breathe again. Our eyes meet, but again, he doesn’t speak to me. “We need to set up a more convenient place for her to stay. She’ll be with us for a few days.”\n\nDays? I bite the inside of my cheek. But captive for days is still better than dead.\n\n“Why the hell are we keeping her?” one guy asks. They’re still working; I can hear the crinkle of trash bags being wrapped around a body. “The sooner we get done with her, the better.”\n\n“Miss Caine turns out to be valuable,” Paul says.\n\nSurely he doesn’t know anything about the Firebirds. They haven’t tried to take them, anyway; both of the Firebird devices are still nestled against my chest, metal edges almost cutting into my skin from the pressure of the tape. Nobody from this dimension should notice them easily.\n\nPaul answers the question I didn’t ask aloud. “Her sister’s engaged to a billionaire. Wyatt Conley, the founder of ConTech. Ten minutes ago, at a press conference, he offered a million dollars for information leading to her safe return.”\n\nI could scream in frustration. If Wyatt hadn’t done that, they probably would have let me go within the hour! Even now, in a world where he’s actually trying to help me, he’s still screwing me over. Figures.\n\nYet I take comfort in one fact: The price of my life is one million dollars. Wyatt’s reward might keep me imprisoned, but it might also keep me alive.\n\n16\n\nAPPARENTLY THIS ISN’T THE FIRST TIME THESE GUYS HAVE kept a prisoner. Leonid’s men prepare for my captivity swiftly and efficiently.\n\nThe bag goes back over my head before the duct tape is cut. They get rid of the zip tie around my ankles—blood rushes into my cold, tingling feet—but the one around my wrists remains. The large hand that closes around my arm doesn’t belong to Paul; I know from the way the fingers dig cruelly into my flesh, even through my thick wool sweater. Many footsteps follow and surround me, a dull ominous cloud of sound. The loudest thing I hear is my own ragged breathing within the bag. My half-numb legs make me clumsy as I walk along some corridors, turning that way and this, until someone jerks me to a halt and growls, “Down the stairs.”\n\nI reach forward with one leg and feel the first step—then almost lose my balance and fall. One of the men near me laughs at my uncertainty, and rage swells inside so hot my temples throb. It’s almost enough to turn me stupid, to make me start screaming at him. You think it’s so funny? I’m scared to death and I can’t see where I’m going and you’re trying to push me down a flight of stairs and if I ever get my hands free—\n\nBut I remember the guns, and say nothing.\n\nA gentler hand cups my shoulder. “Here,” Paul murmurs. “I’ll walk you down.”\n\nI lean on him the entire way, as I feel each step with my toes. The space where they’re putting me is so damp I already feel clammy. Cold, too. I remain aware of the warmth of Paul’s body near mine.\n\nWhen I finally stand on a level floor, the door above us swings shut; several locks turn and click, sealing Paul and me within. One tug, and Paul lifts the bag away from my head. This room is smaller than the one I was originally held in, and quieter, too, farther from any sounds of the city above. More light shines from the few bulbs on the low ceiling, though, and the floor lacks a drain. Of the two rooms, I definitely prefer this one.\n\nIn one corner I see a cot with a blanket; in another, a bucket with a lid. Normally the thought of peeing in a bucket would gross me out, but I’ve been on the verge of wetting myself since the first moment I was grabbed on the street. By now the bucket looks pretty good.\n\nPaul says, “We’ll bring you some food soon. A few bottles of water. The blanket should keep you warm, but if you need another, tell whoever comes in here.”\n\n“You. I want it to be you.”\n\nDifferent emotions flicker across his face—surprise, confusion, even some pleasure at being chosen. He says only, “Why me?”\n\nBecause I have to get close to you if I’m going to have any chance of rescuing my Paul’s soul. Fortunately I have other reasons, ones I can say out loud. “You want me alive. And you wouldn’t hurt me.”\n\n“No one here is going to hurt you,” Paul says. “They have their orders, and they’ll follow them.”\n\nI lift my chin. “It wouldn’t matter what the orders were. You wouldn’t hurt me, no matter what.”"

        "content": "He raises one eyebrow, just like Mr. Spock—one of his favorite characters. If the situation were any less dire, I’d have to laugh. “You don’t have the necessary information to make a judgment.”\n\nA thousand memories of Paul flip through my mind: making lasagna together the night before Thanksgiving, riding in a submarine in an entirely new world, kissing in the train station, listening to music in the car as we drove to Muir Woods, simply holding each other in his dorm room and feeling the rise and fall of his breath beneath my hands.\n\nThat Paul is within this one.\n\n“I know enough,” I say.\n\nPaul studies me a moment longer, then breaks the connection between us as he turns away. “You have the necessities. And—like I said—let us know if you need another blanket.”\n\nEven now he’s trying to shelter me. “Okay.”\n\n“The door overhead will be padlocked. No one outside this building will be able to hear you, regardless of what you do. I argued that you should be given a cot, even when the others pointed out that you could break it down and use the pieces as weapons against anyone who comes into this room. If you’re considering that plan of action, don’t. It will be futile, because others will be outside, ready to stop you through any means necessary. Then you won’t be able to keep the cot any longer. Have I made the conditions of your stay clear?”\n\nMy stay. Like I’m at the Hilton. “Crystal.”\n\nPaul hesitates a moment longer—like he thinks I haven’t really understood, or that I’m not taking it seriously. I don’t know how he can think that; somebody got shot to death while standing about three feet from me, less than an hour ago.\n\nWhat he senses—what he knows, I think—is that I’m not afraid of him.\n\nPaul says nothing else, simply nods as he heads up the concrete steps.\n\nThe door thudding shut ought to sound ominous; instead, when I hear it, I smile. I can smile because I know something the others don’t, something Paul himself doesn’t know yet.\n\nPaul can’t stand not understanding why something happens. It doesn’t matter whether that’s some freak behavior of subatomic particles in an experiment or people laughing at a joke he doesn’t get; it drives him nuts. He responds to uncertainty by charging at it, determined to force the mysterious to make sense. This tendency of his can be frustrating—Paul wants people to behave logically, at least most of the time, and there’s no way to get him to accept that they just don’t. But it’s also one of the reasons he’s such an amazing scientist at an age most people are still picking a major. The easy explanation is never enough for Paul.\n\nRight now, he’s asking himself why I’m so sure he won’t hurt me. Why I trust someone I met while I was duct-taped to a chair. Obviously he can’t begin to guess the real answer.\n\nPaul will want to talk. I can prove that I know him like nobody else ever has, or ever will. If I can win him over enough to untie my hands, while we’re in here alone together—then I’ve saved the next part of my Paul’s soul.\n\nAs I lie on this cot, I have no way of knowing how much time has passed. Forget a phone or a clock—I don’t even have sunlight to go by, if the sun has come up yet, which I doubt. So maybe an hour passes, or maybe three do; it doesn’t make any difference. I just have to stay here, studying my makeshift cell and waiting for a chance to talk with Paul again.\n\nMy surroundings don’t give me much to work with. The room probably measures about ten by ten. Walls: unpainted cinder blocks. Ceiling: not sure, but whatever it is, it’s solid—forget any removable panels or inviting air ducts. Floor: concrete, no drain, which is a good sign I wouldn’t have known to look for yesterday. I’m lying on a sky-blue comforter, which was nice once but has seen wear; something about the cozy fabric plus the hard use makes me think this blanket belonged to a child, long ago. Who takes a blanket from their kid’s bed and uses it when they’re kidnapping someone? How can anybody be that schizo? I can’t understand it. Add another entry to the extremely long list of reasons why I would make a bad mobster.\n\nThe eerie quiet is the worst part. This blank, cold room could stand in for a sensory-deprivation chamber. Once I didn’t understand how solitary confinement could drive prisoners insane, but when I try to imagine being in a place like this for months or years, I see how it could happen.\n\nBut nobody comes down to harm me. Except for my wrists, I’m in no pain. I tell myself it’s not so bad.\n\n(So far, the worst part was I had to use the bucket once, which was about as gross as you’d imagine. At least the Russian mafia politely provided a lid.)\n\nHonestly, I’m probably doing better than my parents right now. I close my eyes tightly, thinking about how scared they must be. Their only comfort must be Wyatt’s reward offer.\n\nBut I can’t rely on Wyatt Conley’s “good heart.” Yeah, it looks like he loves Josie in this universe, but that doesn’t change the fact that he’s corrupt to the core. If anyone could be callous enough to screw around with a ransom for my life, it’s him. Maybe he’s trying to get the Russian mob to give him a discount.\n\nSome sense of time returns when the padlock clatters against my door. I sit upright as the door swings open. The hair on my scalp prickles in fear when I hear the heavy tread on the stairs. Within moments I realize something very good—they’re bringing me food—and something very bad—Paul’s not the one bringing it.\n\nOne of the ski-mask guys carries a paper sack and a plastic bottle of Sprite. From the paper sack he pulls out a damp-looking sandwich that has probably been Saran Wrapped for at least a couple of days, and a small bag of ranch-flavor potato chips. I hate ranch flavor, but right now? I can’t wait to stuff the chips in my face as fast as possible.\n\n“Can you take this off?” I say to Masked Guy, holding up my zip-tied wrists.\n\nHe laughs. “You want food badly enough, you can eat it with those on.” Then, perhaps reconsidering, he leans down and opens the Sprite bottle for me. Thanks, Mr. Hospitality.\n\nI start working on the bag of chips. Masked Guy just stands there, staring at me. Probably he’s watching to make sure I don’t do something brave/stupid, but I’m reminded how much I’m at their mercy. Paul is only one man in what appears to be a very large, very ruthless organization. He would protect me, but with all the others, I have no guarantees.\n\nThen I hear Paul’s voice from above, loud, and in proper Russian I understand, “Stop wasting time down there. Come back.”\n\nMasked Guy huffs. I don’t need any background knowledge to know exactly what he’s thinking: The boss’s kid thinks he can order me around? Snot-nosed brat! But he doesn’t dare defy Leonid’s son.\n\nFor the first time, though, I realize that Paul can’t be with me every second. What do I do if someone escalates this? What if someone is on the verge of raping me, or torturing me? As long as Leonid’s in charge, if Paul were gone for some period of time—that could happen. Could I really bear that for this world’s Marguerite?\n\nI’d like to think I wouldn’t abandon her here no matter what. But even if I wanted to leave her behind and get out of this universe, at least for a while, I couldn’t. While I can touch the Firebirds with my hands bound, even kind of get my fingers around one, I just don’t have enough flexibility to work the controls. So there’s no getting out of this one, no matter what."

        "content": "As long as my hands are bound, I’m trapped here.\n\nMasked Guy stomps up the stairs—wow, Russian mobsters are brattier than I would have thought. But he doesn’t shut the door behind him. Instead, Paul descends the steps, returning to my side.\n\n“He didn’t bother you?” he says.\n\nStill protecting me. “No. I’m all right.”\n\nThe door overhead swings shut with a clang. Paul glances upward, eyes narrowing in irritation, or anger. Maybe he and Masked Guy have clashed before. At any rate, he didn’t fully trust the guy with me. “If he ever says or does anything that scares you, shout for me. Or scream. I’ll come.”\n\nLike this whole scenario doesn’t scare me. But I nod, and Paul turns away, ready to go upstairs and tell Masked Guy to watch his step. I ought to be glad about that, but instead, I’m desperate not to lose contact with Paul again. The word comes out of my mouth almost before I can think about it: “Stay.”\n\nHe stops. “Why?”\n\n“It’s so quiet down here I can’t stand it much longer.”\n\nAfter a moment, Paul says, “I meant to talk with you anyway.”\n\nDon’t overreact. Be casual. You have an opportunity here. “Okay. Good.”\n\nHe folds his arms across his chest as he leans back against the far wall. “You trust me. And you shouldn’t. Why?”\n\n“You’re not like the others.” Should I risk it? Might as well try. “Not like your father.”\n\nHis eyes narrow, but he doesn’t disagree.\n\nIn my own dimension, Paul will never talk much about his family. Finally I understand why—but even when he learns I know the awful truth, he’ll resist telling me more. I’d already realized how ashamed he was of his family. Not embarrassed. Ashamed. Like it kills him a little every time he thinks of it. When he told me his parents were “bad people,” I thought they were alcoholics or maybe even abusive. Now I see how they actually failed him: Paul’s parents never even gave a damn. If you love your kids, you don’t live a life of total corruption. You don’t expose them to violence. You don’t try to shove them into following your own wretched example instead of going after their dreams. Mr. and Mrs. Markov did all that to Paul and more. His good heart had to be so strong to survive that intact, but it did. In my world, and in so many others.\n\nHas he always thought I’d hate him if I knew?\n\nMaybe this is my chance to find out the rest of the story. Then I can tell Paul I’ve discovered it all, and I love him even more.\n\n“What’s your mother like?” I ask him.\n\n“Why should you care?”\n\n“I’ve been down here too long. I’m bored. Is she in the family business too?”\n\n“Family business?”\n\n“What else should I call it?”\n\nPaul doesn’t provide another term, probably because most of the alternatives are worse. “She’s not directly involved.”\n\n“Does she, um, approve?”\n\nHe laughs softly, in contempt. But only when he speaks do I realize the contempt isn’t for me. “My father’s word is law, for all of us. My mother insists on that even more than he does. She worships him.”\n\n“Did she want you to work for your dad?”\n\n“Insisted on it.” Paul shakes his head at some scene in his past that must be playing out in his mind. “She even gave me my first tattoo.”\n\nOkay, that took a left turn. “What does a tattoo have to do with, um, this life?”\n\nFor a long moment Paul stares at me, like he can’t understand why I’m asking or why he wants to answer. But he does want to tell me; I can see it in his eyes. Finally he says, “In Russia, members of ‘this life’ are always tattooed. The images reveal the crimes they’ve committed, the time they’ve served in prison. Or the things they believe.”\n\n“What tattoos do you have?” He can’t have done terrible things like his father, or those awful men upstairs. Paul’s not like them, and never could be. Yet I see the lines of ink at his open collar, testament to a divergence between this Paul and my own.\n\nPaul notices my gaze on his skin. He says, “This is just to show you. No other reason.” And then he starts unbuttoning his shirt.\n\nOnce again I remember the day Paul posed for me as my model. Not what I need to think about right now. Instead, I concentrate on the fact that he told me not to be afraid, that he’s trying to comfort me as much as he can.\n\nHe doesn’t strip off his shirt, doesn’t even open it all the way. But the top half of his chest is mostly exposed now and I can see the tattoos for myself. They’re simple, drawn only in blue-black ink, but artfully done. The largest tattoo is in the middle of his chest, a surprisingly devout image of the Virgin Mary with baby Jesus. On one shoulder is a rose that looks withered, or dried; on the other, a dove perches on a twig.\n\nIn my mind I hear Lieutenant Markov whisper, Golubka. He called me his little dove as he held me in his arms.\n\n“You like this one?” Paul gestures toward that shoulder. “It means ‘deliverance from suffering.’ The rose, that says I would prefer death to dishonor. And the Madonna tells anyone who understands that I was born into—what you call ‘this life.’”\n\nThe Madonna requires no explanation. The meaning of the rose doesn’t surprise me either; Paul’s sense of decency and kindness holds true even in a reality where he didn’t escape his parents’ corruption. But the dove . . .\n\nI look into his eyes. “What suffering were you delivered from?” I ask as gently as I can. “Or are you still waiting for deliverance?”\n\nPaul stiffens. Immediately he begins buttoning his shirt. “You ask too many questions.”\n\n“But you want to answer me. Don’t you?”\n\nHe pauses for a long moment, and I know he feels it too—the electric connection between us that spans the worlds. Yet Paul can’t understand why he has this bond with a stranger, why he felt the need to show me the secrets inked on his skin, or why I reach out for him even now. Baffled, almost hurt, he simply goes up the stairs without another word.\n\nAs the door shuts and locks again, I take a deep breath and realize I’m shaking. I trust him so deeply, but this scenario is unlike any I’ve ever faced while traveling between the universes; I could make the wrong move at any moment and upset a very delicate balance.\n\nGetting closer to Paul in this dimension means playing with fire.\n\n17\n\nWHEN THE HIGHLIGHT OF YOUR DAY IS SOMEONE GIVING you a fresh bathroom bucket—it’s not a good sign.\n\nMasked Guy hauled the old bucket upstairs. He seemed about as thrilled with his errand as you’d expect, but I was still sort of sorry to see him go. After so long in this featureless underground cell, seeing anyone—even him—was fuel for my understimulated mind. But by now he’s been gone for a while, however long a while is, and I feel the room shrinking around me, sealing me farther away from the real world.\n\nMy sense of time has all but collapsed. I have no idea how long I’ve been down here. More than three hours since they brought me food, though, because I’m hungry. Beyond that, I can’t tell.\n\nI’m exhausted. At this point, this world’s Marguerite must have been awake for more than twenty-four hours straight."

        "content": "Surely the negotiations for my release have begun. Wyatt Conley might already have bankers bringing him a million dollars in unmarked bills. Or instead of collecting a cash-stuffed briefcase from under a park bench, Leonid’s probably giving Conley the number of some Cayman Islands account that will mysteriously disappear the moment after the ransom deposits.\n\nThe door at the top of the stairs swings open. The same strange cocktail of emotions swirls within me—fear, hope, the peculiar happiness of knowing that at least something is happening—\n\n—when I see Paul returning to me, and hope eclipses all the rest.\n\n“Here,” he says. He’s holding a white Styrofoam container and a can of ginger ale. “You must be hungry again.”\n\n“I am. What time is it?”\n\n“Does it matter?”\n\n“I’d just like to know.” My voice shakes, but I swallow hard and continue. “Being in this room for so long—it’s weird, not knowing anything that’s happening outside.”\n\nPaul hesitates. His gray eyes are almost unreadable, but I can see that he doesn’t like realizing how scared I am. When he answers me, his words are simple and precise. “It’s early afternoon. Cloudy. We had rain earlier, but it stopped.”\n\nWho knew it could feel like such a relief just to hear what the sky looks like? “Thanks.”\n\n“Your lunch is late. I’ll make sure dinner gets here faster, if you’re still . . . with us.”\n\nDoes that mean “still with us” as in “not yet free,” or as in “alive”? I’m about 99 percent sure he means the former. In this situation, though, 99 percent is not enough.\n\nPaul pulls back the Styrofoam lid to reveal lasagna and garlic bread. The smell of tomato sauce, cheese, and garlic almost makes me reel; I’m that hungry.\n\nBut I also remember the night Paul and I made lasagna together in my family’s kitchen. We listened to Rachmaninoff, and our shoulders brushed against each other, and we laughed every time we screwed something up, which happened constantly. That was the first night I recognized that my feelings for Paul had begun to change. Sometimes I think of it as the first night of “us.”\n\n“Any chance of taking these off?” I offer my bound wrists to Paul. “If I try to eat Italian food with my hands tied, I’m going to get it all over myself. Or do you need a chance to laugh at me?”\n\nPaul would never laugh at someone for a thing like that. He’d be offended by the very suggestion, which is what I’m counting on.\n\nBut he doesn’t cut through the zip ties. Instead, he says, “I’ll help you.”\n\nAs he takes the white plastic fork from its plastic sleeve, I say, “You mean you’re going to feed me?”\n\n“It’s like you said. Otherwise, you’d make a mess.” He hands me the thin paper napkin. “The ties have to stay on.”\n\nHe starts to sit on the edge of my cot, then pulls back. No doubt he thinks I’ll feel threatened if he comes close to me too quickly—which I would, under normal circumstances. Actually, as he finally settles next to me, I feel comforted.\n\nThis hesitation means he’s thinking of me. Trying to make this easier.\n\nAnd even though I can’t make my move yet, it helps me to know he’s this close to the Firebirds.\n\nPaul carefully gets a forkful of lasagna, lets the first droplets of sauce fall, then brings it to my mouth. I feel weirdly self-conscious about taking the initial bite. After that, though, I don’t care. The first taste of tomato sauce against my tongue makes me salivate so quickly my mouth almost hurts. I can handle the garlic bread myself, so I sop that in the sauce and eat some before he offers me the next bite. I could swear I’ve never eaten anything this good before in my life.\n\n“You were hungrier than I thought,” Paul says.\n\nI must be wolfing this stuff down like a stray dog. Forcing myself to chew slower, I dab at my mouth with the flimsy paper napkin. “Sorry.”\n\n“Don’t apologize. The fault was mine.”\n\nPaul feels guilty. Maybe I can use that. “Does this establishment offer showers? A bath?” He’d take off the zip ties to let me bathe, surely. “Between the crazy eating and the crazy hair, I bet I look like the Tasmanian Devil.”\n\n“You’ve looked better.”\n\nOuch. I glare at him. “How would you know?”\n\n“I would assume.”\n\nOnce again I remind myself that Paul’s rudeness is always a kind of honesty. Since last night, I’ve been thrown in the back of a van, terrified, imprisoned, and duct-taped. Plus I’m sleep-deprived. I hope I’ve looked better than I must right now.\n\n“Why did it take so long for the food?” I ask. “You only get your ransom money if I’m returned safe and sound, right? Starved to death definitely wouldn’t count as ‘safe.’”\n\n“It takes weeks for a human being to die of starvation. Thirst kills faster, within days.” Another thing that’s the same in this dimension? The way Paul’s face looks when he realizes he’s just said something amazingly tactless one second too late to take it back. “Nobody’s going to deny you food or water. Let’s leave it at that.”\n\n“Did you get some dinner too? I’d bet anything you love lasagna.”\n\nHe hesitates. “Everyone loves lasagna.”\n\n“But you really love it.” I say this as innocently as I can, between bites. “I bet you’ve even learned to make lasagna yourself.”\n\nHe isn’t fazed—at least, visibly. “You like to pretend that you know me very well.”\n\n“I have instincts about people.”\n\n“Unlikely. What most people call instinct in people is really the interpretation of small subconscious cues.”\n\n“Maybe I picked up on some of those.”\n\n“There are no subconscious cues that could tell you I enjoy lasagna.”\n\nI laugh out loud. Paul does that thing where he realizes something he’s said in seriousness is funny—his expression clouds, and he tries to smile, but it never quite works. Moments like that make him feel vulnerable. So I quickly say, “It’s like you said. Everybody loves lasagna. That’s all.”\n\n“That’s not all.”\n\n“What else could it be?” He offers me one more bite, and I take it, the conversation flowing smoothly around my meal.\n\n“I don’t know,” he says. “But I don’t believe in instincts.”\n\n“What about psychic powers?”\n\nThis earns me a stare as withering as the one I’d get from my scientist Paul back home. I decide to mess with his rational head, for once; besides, after hours tied up and freaking out, I need to remind myself how much I know. What power I still possess.\n\nSo I say, “For instance, my instincts—or powers, you decide—they’re telling me you wanted to follow a very different path in life. Something that wasn’t illegal. Something more than this, bigger and more meaningful. Personally, I think you would’ve been a good . . . scientist.”\n\nIf the situation were less terrible, the look on his face would be hilarious. He puts down the Styrofoam container and stands up. “How could you guess that I wanted—?” His words stop as he catches himself.\n\nHow would I have guessed that? “The way you always seem to be analyzing things. You’re smart. I can tell.”"

        "content": "Paul paces in front of me, his footsteps loud in this small, dark cell. “Someone else has told you about me. There’s no other way you could know that.”\n\n“Who knew that, besides you? Nobody, I bet. You don’t open up to many people.” Which means any people.\n\nHe takes a step backward to consider me from a different angle. “What else do your ‘instincts’ tell you about me?”\n\nI remember the things I shouted after the last dimension’s Paul. They were too intimate, too exact. This time, my answer will be simple. It will be honest. But it will still be some of what I love about him.\n\nAfter all, a splinter of my Paul is within this man, even now.\n\n“You like facts. You want to be objective. So sometimes people assume you’re cold, but you’re not. Not at all. I think you feel more deeply than most people ever do; you just don’t know how to show it. You always feel—out of step. You’re not like the people around you, and they know it as well as you do. And you think it’s because something’s wrong with you, so you retreat deeper into the background. That just means people don’t get to know the real you.”\n\nPaul takes one step backward. I think he doesn’t know whether to be moved or frightened.\n\n“You’re lonely,” I say, more softly. “You’ve been lonely so long I think you’ve forgotten there’s any other way to be.”\n\nHe breathes in deeply. By now the way he looks at me reminds me more of my own Paul—that mixture of uncertainty and awe I remember from our first days together.\n\nIs that part of his soul shining through? Will he save me after all?\n\nI lean forward, willing him to understand it’s okay for us to be close. “You want a family. Not your own—a real family, made up of people who take care of each other. And when people are scared of you, because you’re so big, it kills you a little inside. Because you can be so gentle. So kind.”\n\n“You don’t know me,” Paul says, as if by pronouncing the words he can make them true.\n\n“I wish you could learn how to show more people the real you. If you could, nobody would ever be scared of you again.” Nobody could help but love you, I want to add. But that’s a step too far.\n\nAfter a moment, he laughs, a hard, strange sound. “You learned all this already?”\n\n“First impressions can tell you a lot.” I smile. “So, what do you see when you look at me?”\n\nI’m not expecting much of an answer—but I get one.\n\n“You’re insecure,” Paul says flatly. “So you exaggerate your knowledge or emotions to draw attention you think you won’t get otherwise. You have genuine talents, however. If you didn’t, you wouldn’t be willing to put yourself forward. Why they’re not enough for you, I don’t know. You’re sophisticated for your age in some ways, naive in others, which makes me think you went to one of the experimental schools—a Waldorf school, maybe—or you could have been educated at home by intelligent people. You come across as a normal young girl, but when angered, I suspect you’re dangerous. I say that even though I’m the one with the gun.”\n\nHis little joke gets lost in all the rest. I’m too astonished, too hurt, by this bald accuracy. Naive? Insecure? Is that what my Paul thinks too?\n\nThe last part is the only one I can bring myself to talk about. “Dangerous?”\n\n“You’re calm under pressure. Calmer than you should be.” Paul’s gaze rakes over me, as though his perception alone could scour me raw. “Maybe you did reach out to me by accident. But now you taunt me with this life I can never have—that’s either courage or madness. I don’t know which. All I know is that you’re not an ordinary girl. You’ve seen things others haven’t. Done things others couldn’t.”\n\nI feel like I’m going to cry, but I won’t. Not in front of him, not now.\n\nHe sees my weakness, but doesn’t spare me the last: “You think your specialness makes you invulnerable. It doesn’t.”\n\nWith that Paul walks upstairs. His only goodbye is the door slamming shut.\n\n18\n\nDESPITE MY EXHAUSTION, I LIE AWAKE FOR WHAT SEEMS TO be a long time.\n\nPaul thinks I’m pathetic. Ridiculous. Naive, and proud, and a hundred other things I never wanted to be.\n\nMaybe that seems like a stupid thing to worry about, compared to the fact that I’m being held captive by armed mobsters. But I was relying on my knowledge of Paul to protect me here, and now it feels like that shield is gone.\n\nHe saw more in me after one day than I saw in him after months of his practically living at our house. Of course I already knew Paul was perceptive. One of the reasons I fell for my Paul was because he saw through all my defenses. Somehow he saw the real me, and he loved what he saw.\n\nThis Paul looks at me and sees weakness. Immaturity. Even danger.\n\nOkay, I did set out to kill you once, but I had a good reason. Doubt he wants to hear that.\n\nWhatever he’s seen, he doesn’t like it.\n\nMaybe it was that splinter of my Paul inside him that knew so much. But that would be even worse. Does my Paul think all those things too? He can’t. Otherwise he couldn’t love me.\n\nI imagine his soul within this Paul’s. If they influence each other, it won’t only be my Paul affecting him. Maybe this Paul’s contempt will carry over. Maybe my Paul will begin to think of me as insecure and arrogant. Maybe he’ll never see me the same way.\n\nEven if I can put the three parts of Paul’s soul together again, he might never be the same.\n\nThen I hear something from above—a low, heavy thud. Another. Like thunder, but not—\n\nI jump as I hear loud popping, over and over, super fast. My first thought is of one of those little bundles of fireworks—but I know better. It’s gunfire.\n\nOh God, oh god ohgodohgod. What’s happening?\n\nForget what Paul said about the cot. I kick at one of the legs, and it collapses. If I can pry one of the poles free, that would at least be a weapon. Even with my hands tied, I can probably manage that.\n\nThe door swings open. The sound of gunfire goes from loud to deafening. I push myself into the corner, like that’s going to do any good. Paul comes downstairs toward me.\n\n“Come on!” he shouts, grabbing my wrist. His grip is too tight, and the raw stripes on my skin beneath the zip tie sting. It doesn’t matter. I follow him, stumbling up the stairs.\n\nI scream over the sound, “What’s happening?”\n\n“You shouldn’t be here!”\n\nNot an answer. But I agree with him.\n\nNone of the shooters are visible in the dark concrete corridor, but distant sparks suggest ricochets. The gunfire echoes so that the sound doubles on itself, disorienting me.\n\nPaul pulls me forward, and we turn a corner—another—and now the fight seems farther away. The roar of guns has muted, only slightly, but enough that my ears stop ringing. Paul opens a door to reveal a large closet. “Get in.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Get in!” he shouts. “You’re safer here.”\n\n“How?”\n\nPaul’s hand fists in my sweater. “My father would kill you rather than let you be taken. Do you understand?”\n\nI wish I didn’t.\n\nTerrified as I am, I try to use this moment. “Please. You have to untie my hands. What if someone else comes for me?” I hold up my bound wrists. “Please.”"

        "content": "He makes his decision in an instant; the butterfly knife seems to appear in his hand by magic. I jump a little, but then hold still so he can cut through the plastic. He does this deftly, in one smooth practiced motion.\n\nAll I have to do is grab him, grab the Firebird, and I can get the next sliver of Paul’s soul back again—\n\nBut immediately Paul shoves me into the closet so hard I hit the back wall. It’s not cruelty; this is his idea of keeping me safe. “Don’t move until I come back for you. Do you understand? You must not move.” Then he slams the door shut and turns the lock, sealing me in total darkness.\n\nI miss my cell already.\n\nPaul will come back for me. I’ll have another chance. I take deep breaths and try to tell myself things are looking up, between bursts of distant gunfire.\n\nAt least Paul brought me to a safer place. Protected me. The man I love is in there after all, just buried deep.\n\nMy father would kill you rather than let you be taken, he said. Taken by who? A rival gang? The police?\n\nImpossible to guess what’s going on. I have no way to know until Paul comes back for me. And what if it’s not Paul who opens the door?\n\nI don’t want to be here. Maybe I don’t have to be here.\n\nEven now, I don’t want to escape this place before I’ve had a chance to rescue that splinter of my Paul’s soul. Still, I could contact him again and ask to meet like actual normal human beings—hire a detective to locate him—\n\nI can find another way.\n\nPaul, I love you, but I’m getting myself out of this.\n\nLying down, back on the floor, I kick up at the doorknob with both feet, hard. The wood starts to splinter; this closet wasn’t meant for anything but brooms. Two more kicks, and the door wobbles open.\n\nI jump to my feet and start running away from the noise. Hopefully the roar of the guns kept anyone from hearing me break out. Even though my knees buckle under me, and I’m breathing so hard the world goes dark and sparkly around the edges, I push myself forward; there are no second chances, not with this.\n\nThe corridors bend, bend again, like the walls of a maze. This place is huge, maybe many buildings’ basements connected into one compound. But that’s good. If so, there are many ways out, and I only have to find one.\n\nBy the time I almost can’t hear the gun battle behind me, I take another turn and see the most beautiful sight: light filtering in from a grid above. The rusty metal ladder bolted to the wall suggests this is for utility service. Which means that grid comes off.\n\nThe ladder is so rusty that it crumbles slightly beneath my hands and feet. When I get to the top, I press both hands against the grid—and it doesn’t move.\n\nThe metal presses into my palms, carving cross-hatches into my flesh, but I give it all my strength anyway. Still it won’t budge.\n\nBreathing hard, trembling, I try to think of what to do next. One, go down the ladder and find another exit. Two, go down the ladder, but to search for something to use to pry the grid open.\n\nJust as I’m about to descend, though, a shadow falls over the grid. I look up to see a backlit figure—\n\n—who then crouches down so I can see his face. I shout, “Theo!”\n\n“Marguerite!” He drops to his knees. “Thank God. Are you okay?”\n\n“I’m fine.” I reach through the grid with my fingers, which he takes for just a moment. “What are you doing here?”\n\n“Firebird locator function, remember? I tracked your signal all the way out here to Brighton Beach. Once I was sure you were here—I tried to get to you myself, but I couldn’t—so I phoned in an anonymous tip to the cops about your location.”\n\nOf course! I ought to have thought of that. “You’re incredible.”\n\n“That’s what all the girls say.” His smile has the weariness of relief. Along one cheekbone I see a deep bruise beneath scraped skin, no doubt from when he was thrown to the ground during my kidnapping. “Did they hurt you?”\n\n“No. I’m okay. I just need some help with this grate.”\n\n“Hang on.”\n\nTheo vanishes for a moment, and I hear the sounds of someone rummaging through trash. This must be a back alley; it’s dark outside, nighttime, so the light I see must come from a streetlamp. I take deep breaths, trying to calm myself. Almost home free, now.\n\nThen all I have to do is figure out how to encounter the mobster Paul Markov again—not exactly easy—but no. That’s not all I have to do in this dimension. “We still have to ruin the Firebird data.”\n\n“Done and done. Your parents were distracted, so I took my chance. Put the virus on all their computers already, made it look like Ukrainian hackers.”\n\nI’m sure he’s telling the truth, but not the whole truth. Theo betrayed my parents so I wouldn’t have to; he spared me that pain, even though he loves them nearly as much. “Thank you,” I say quietly.\n\n“Just call me your sin-eater.” Theo comes back with a hubcap or something else round and metal; whatever it is, he’s able to wedge it beneath the metal edge of the grid. “Who were those guys?”\n\nI don’t know how to even begin telling Theo about Paul in this dimension. “You don’t want to know.”\n\n“Hang on—” With a grunt, Theo shoves harder against the grid, and the corner pops up with a clang. I push it aside and climb up, into freedom, into Theo’s arms.\n\nHe sighs heavily, and I lean against his chest. After this long, terrifying day, it feels so good to be held. I clutch his jacket, pulling him even closer. I only want to stay here, safe and sound, forever.\n\nBut I’m not safe yet. “Come on. Let’s go.”\n\nTheo grabs my hand and pulls me to my feet. I tell myself, Just a few minutes now. Get this Marguerite to safety and rest. Then you can figure out your next move.\n\nJust as we’re about to dash toward the street, one of the doors to the alley swings open, hard, metal slamming against brick. We startle, and Theo gasps when he sees Paul running out.\n\nMaybe it’s because Paul has a gun in his hand.\n\nPaul stops short, staring at us. “I told you to stay put,” he says to me, before looking at Theo. “Where are you taking her?”\n\n“Marguerite’s okay. I’ve got her, she’s all right.” Theo’s relieved. He assumes Paul could only be here to help, maybe even that he’s with the police. Which is why he steps forward, one hand up. “It’s all good.”\n\n“Why do you act like I know you?” Paul demands. Something wild lurks within his voice, his eyes; he’s had to pretend to be brave here, to be tough, which means he has no way to deal with fear. His grip on his firearm is tight. “Why do both of you do that?”\n\nTheo grins. “Can’t help it, pal.”\n\nHe steps away from us, lowering his weapon, no doubt about to run. Even in my terror, I know I will never see this Paul again.\n\nIf I think, I won’t act. So I hurl myself at him. He’s too surprised to raise the weapon right away, which gives me my chance to make contact.\n\nEven as we slam into the brick wall, even as I look down at the gun in his hand, I manage to grab Paul’s Firebird and press it against his chest—against the dove—and there it is, that tiny warm vibration that means I’ve rescued the next part of his soul."

        "content": "Paul curses in pain and shoves me back so hard I fall to the ground. Theo runs toward us, yelling, “What are you—”\n\nWhat happens next is so fast that everything blurs together.\n\nThe sounds all seem to roar at once: swearing, screaming, gunfire. The few concrete images I see have no order, no sense, not even motion, as if they were a series of photographs flung in front of me.\n\nPaul, swinging his gun toward us.\n\nTheo throwing his arms wide to try to defend me.\n\nFlashes of fire at the muzzle of Paul’s gun.\n\nBlood and bone spraying outward.\n\nTheo falling.\n\nMy own hands reaching for Theo as I sink down beside him.\n\nAnd one terrible moment when my eyes meet Paul’s, and I see no regret. No remorse.\n\nPaul says, “You don’t know me.” And then he runs away, disappearing into the dark.\n\nThe first thing I think is stupid, the product of shock: This is real. It’s all real.\n\nThen I hear Theo groan, and I pull myself together.\n\n“Are you okay?” I roll Theo over, knowing he’s not. At first I’m relieved, because he’s conscious and his shirt is only flecked with blood. Then I see his legs. “Oh, my God.”\n\n“Jesus.” Theo can hardly get the word out; he’s trying not to cry, or scream.\n\nFrom the thighs down his legs look like something from a butcher shop: exposed, broken bone, and flesh torn into ribbons. Shards of white jutting from the gory mess must be what’s left of his kneecaps.\n\nThere’s so much blood. It oozes down the wall where it spattered; it drips from my hair, my ear. It pools on the asphalt beneath us, black rather than red in the twilight darkness, and shining as each puddle enlarges. Theo could hemorrhage to death within minutes.\n\n“Hang on.” I undo his belt and pull it free of the loops, so I can wrap it around one leg as a tourniquet. I need to do the other one too. As loud as I can, I scream, “Somebody help!”\n\n“Phone.” By now Theo’s voice is hardly a whisper, but that’s enough. I fumble in his back pocket and pull out his cell phone. Thank God it lets me call 911 without the security code.\n\nThe next few minutes aren’t much clearer. Theo’s able to give me the address of our location. Emergency crews were standing by during the police raid, so EMTs get to us within moments. By then Theo’s skin has turned white and his breathing is shallow, but he can still talk. I can tell by the way the EMTs act that they expect him to live.\n\nBut they don’t have to tell me that he might lose his legs.\n\nPaul shot without hesitating. Without blinking. He savagely destroyed a stranger’s legs for no reason, and ran away without even looking back.\n\nAll that time I was held captive, I thought he wouldn’t hurt me, but I had no idea who I was really dealing with.\n\nI want to think the splinter of my Paul’s soul within him would have made a difference—but this Paul is still Paul. They are more alike than unalike.\n\nIf we all have one essential self that remains constant through all the worlds, then the evil in this man exists within my Paul, too. Even within the splinters of his soul I’ve already rescued.\n\nThe Firebirds feel heavy around my neck.\n\nAs soon as Theo is settled on a stretcher, the paramedics hook him up to a saline IV. Numbly, I watch the needle enter his skin. While they tape the plastic tubing in place, I lean over Theo. He whispers, “Did you get the splinter?”\n\nEven after this, Theo is still thinking about Paul’s rescue. “Yeah. I got him.” He nods, then grimaces in pain. I can’t bear to watch him go through this anymore. “You need to go on ahead, okay? You’ll have the coordinates. Now get out of here.”\n\n“What?” His voice sounds hoarse, drowsy. “I can’t just—it’s my fault this Theo’s screwed up—I have to—”\n\n“Listen to me.” I’m not sure he’s going to stay fully conscious much longer, especially if the medics have injected any morphine. My hands shake as I manipulate my Firebird to get the proof of his sabotage, unlock the next coordinates, and share that data with Theo’s Firebird, giving him the info he needs to complete this mission. “What’s done is done. I feel like shit about it too, okay? But we can’t help him. You have to take care of yourself now. People in this dimension shouldn’t perceive the Firebirds right away, but at the hospital, they might. Then they’ll take them off you, and who knows when you’ll get them back again—”\n\n“I get it,” he says. “Come on. Let’s go.”\n\n“I can’t,” I whisper.\n\n“Can’t what? We’ve done it. Everything—everything Conley wanted. So we can—”\n\nHe can’t finish the sentence, because he was going to say, rescue the last splinter of Paul.\n\nBut Theo doesn’t need me for that.\n\nIf he goes to Conley now, reports what we’ve done (fudging what happened in the Warverse)—then Conley will give him the coordinates to reach the final dimension where Paul is hidden. Theo will receive the potential cure for Nightthief. Even if Conley is angry that Theo came along with me, he won’t renege on the deal if he thinks I did my part. Everything will be taken care of.\n\n“I can’t look at Paul right now. I can’t be near him. Not yet.” What I need now is a chance to think about what I’ve learned, and what it means. “I’m going someplace Paul can’t be, where he can never follow.”\n\n“Marguerite—” Theo breaks off, like he’s on the verge of passing out. So I put his free hand on his Firebird for him.\n\n“Go to Conley,” I murmur, as the paramedics open the ambulance doors. I brush a lock of hair from his forehead, then take off Paul’s Firebird and put it around Theo’s neck. I whisper, “Take Paul with you. Don’t worry about me. I’m traveling to a safe place. And I promise—I won’t be that far behind.”\n\nI take my Firebird in my hands. I remember Russia, a thousand images all laced with whirling snow. And I fling myself out of this terrible world.\n\n19\n\nI OPEN MY EYES AND SEE AN ORNATELY DECORATED CEILING: cherubs and nymphs painted around embossed gilded medallions, all of it encircling a sumptuous chandelier. As I stir, I realize I’m lying in a bed—one as richly carved as the decorations above me, and topped with an embroidered silk coverlet. Once again, I am Margarita, Grand Duchess of all the Russias, supposedly the daughter of Tsar Alexander V.\n\nI sit up, then grimace as I realize how exhausted I am; apparently this Marguerite hasn’t slept well, if at all. But what strikes me most powerfully is that I don’t know this room at all. It’s not so surprising, perhaps—when I was in this universe before, the royal family never left the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. The Romanovs have many other palaces, so perhaps this is one of those.\n\nStill, it feels . . . off, somehow.\n\nMy eyes widen as I remember—in this world, the tsar wanted to marry me off to the Prince of Wales, heir to the English throne. Oh, shit, is this Buckingham Palace? But there’s no one in the bed with me, and when I look down at my left hand, there’s no ring.\n\nA memory of Lieutenant Markov comes to me so vividly that it’s as if I’m back in the Winter Palace. He is my personal guard, standing at the door, and he is speaking about my anticipated betrothal to the heir to the English throne—and saying so much more than the mere words would suggest."

        "content": "“Surely, my lady, the Prince of Wales will prove a devoted husband. I cannot imagine that any man would not—would not count himself fortunate to have such a wife. That he could fail to love you at first sight. Any man would, my lady.”\n\nIn that moment I knew what he felt. He lived for such a short time after that, not even two whole days after the one and only night we spent together. I hope Lieutenant Markov was able to understand how much I cared. He deserved that—and even more than that, more than he ever got to have—\n\nI loved him so much. I love him still; I will always love him, I think, to the end of my life. But I’ve spent most of the past three months convinced that my love for him meant that I loved every Paul, everywhere. Every person he could ever be.\n\nCould I have loved the Paul I met in New York? The one who could savagely attack a stranger and maim him for life? Part of me wants to say no—but as strange as our connection was there, we did connect. I saw how damaged he was by the horrible life he’d been forced to lead. I also saw his brutality. His capacity for cruelty. When I think of the Paul in the Mafiaverse, I don’t know whether I’m moved by the vulnerability I glimpsed in him, or whether I’ll always be afraid of him.\n\nBoth, I think. Somehow that’s the worst answer of all. The only thing I know is that I can’t be near that Paul or any other, now. Not until I’ve figured out what this means. I need safety and solitude.\n\nLieutenant Markov died fighting for the tsar, fighting to protect me. I held his hand and watched him die. The horror and pain of that moment will never leave me. But right now, I am taking advantage of his death, which made this a dimension no other Paul Markov could ever enter.\n\nHis death is my shelter. I think, Even now, you’re still protecting me. Tears well in my eyes, but I blink them back.\n\nA soft rap at my bedroom door makes me sit upright. “Yes?” I call in English. Hopefully that’s the language I’m supposed to be speaking here.\n\nThe reply comes in French. “Are you ready for your breakfast, Your Imperial Highness?”\n\n“Bring it in, please,” I answer in the same language. (I’ve become better at French through a few of my visits.)\n\nOne woman opens the door for another, who comes in bearing a silver tray. She walks to a small table in the corner and begins setting out a feast: teapot, cream, bread, butter, some kind of pastry.\n\nAnd now I know I’m not in any of the tsar’s palaces. If we took meals in our rooms, those meals were simple, by his order. Also none of the servants wore a uniform like the one this woman wears, a long black dress with white apron, and they spoke Russian or English, never French.\n\nA sky-blue robe lies on the foot of the bed. I reach for it, but the maid hurries from my breakfast to hand the gown to me instead. It’s velvet, thicker and softer than any other I’ve ever felt. As I wrap it around myself, the maid curtsies, then hurries away, leaving me to my meal.\n\nI ought to begin exploring immediately to figure out exactly where the Grand Duchess Margarita is. But my stomach is too empty; I almost feel sick. So instead, I go to the table and start eating.\n\nThis turns out to be the best thing I could’ve done. Not only because this pastry is amazing, but also because my seat at the window reveals the scene outside.\n\nI’m about three or four stories off the ground, looking out at a plaza—one surrounded by elegant buildings, with an Egyptian obelisk in the very center. Despite the early hour, and the cloudy sky overhead turned milky by the morning light, many people hurry by outside, all of them dressed in clothes that look more like they belong in the 1910s: women in long dresses wearing big hats; men in three-piece suits and bowlers, all of them sporting mustaches.\n\nI recognize this plaza. My family traveled to this city a few times when I was young to visit my Kovalenko grandparents before they died. I’m pretty sure that in our universe, something besides an obelisk stands in the center, but I know the locale all the same.\n\nThe grand duchess has gone to Paris.\n\nAfter I’ve stuffed myself with pain au chocolat, I feel steadier and begin to explore in earnest. At first I wonder whether the grand duchess is staying in some other royal residence. For all I know, the French Revolution never happened here. I might be the guest of Marie Antoinette’s great-great-great granddaughter.\n\nBut I don’t remember a surviving French monarchy in this universe, and besides, this building stands in the Place Vendôme. My mother explained to me once, when we were visiting almost a decade ago, that this was where the finest hotels in the world were located. I asked why we weren’t staying there, then, which led to my dad giving me a really long lecture about how capitalism works, and how professors usually aren’t the people it works best for.\n\nOn the hotel napkin, embroidered in white on white is a small crest and the cursive letter R. I remember Theo looking at the hotel in the Warverse and saying it wasn’t the Ritz. This is the Ritz.\n\nThis has to be the nicest hotel suite that exists in the world. In all the worlds. Three bedrooms, enormous sitting rooms, a small kitchen, all of them decorated as richly as the room I woke up in. I think the ceilings must be twenty feet high, and—how many chandeliers can you fit in a hotel suite? Whatever the number is, this place maxes it out.\n\nI must have come to Paris on my own. If the tsar were here, military guards would be all around; if my siblings had come along, they’d be in the other bedrooms. Yet it seems unlike Tsar Alexander V to let me romp to Paris alone.\n\nThe wardrobes are filled with elegant clothing, though much of it appears new and more modern—more flowing silhouettes, a dropped waist or none at all, and deeper colors than the pale shades I usually wore in St. Petersburg. Less lace, more beading. Apparently the grand duchess has done some hard-core shopping while in Paris. Who wouldn’t?\n\nShe would be mourning for her Paul as deeply as I mourn him, probably even more. So she’s consoling herself with this holiday, all the pleasures France has to offer. And the grand duchess has even gained a little weight. I cast a glance at the enormous breakfast behind me, or what remains of it.\n\nI find a sketch pad sitting next to a box of pastels. At first I reach for it, but then I remember when I got those pastels. Lieutenant Markov gave them to me for Christmas. We stood just outside my bedroom door, the threshold all that lay between us, looking at each other almost dizzy with wanting—\n\nShe will have sketched him. I can’t look at that now. Maybe not ever.\n\nInstead, I turn my attention to a small leather book that seems like—yes. It’s for appointments.\n\nHer handwriting is so much better than mine, elegant and flowing, like a professional calligrapher’s; ironically, that makes it harder to read. But I can make out two appointments for today: 11 a.m., Dr. N. Then, 9 p.m., dinner Maxim’s.\n\nWhen a maid comes to help me dress, a few careful questions reveal that I’m not heading out to a physician’s office. Dr. N, whoever that is, will be coming to me. The perks of royalty, I guess.\n\nIs she—am I—sick? Is that the reason for this trip to Paris? Surely if that were true, though, I’d be in a hospital rather than the Ritz. Also, I doubt my family would have let me travel alone; the tsar would of course never leave Russia on my account, but surely Vladimir at least would have come along.\n\nThe maid gets me dressed quickly—the Paris fashions are easier to wear than the long lace gowns from St. Petersburg. Also, thank God someone has invented the bra. It’s kind of weird—triangles of satin, really, without any kind of structure—but even with the extra weight, my breasts have only grown to be “small” instead of “practically nonexistent.” At any rate, I won’t miss the corsets. My drop-waisted gown is the color of roses, and the hem stops well before my ankles. Shocking."

        "content": "I wonder why I’m getting all fixed up for a doctor who’s coming to me. So I have no idea what to expect at 11:00 a.m., but whatever it was, it’s not what I get.\n\n“Dr. N” turns out to stand for Dr. Nilsson, and Dr. Nilsson turns out to be female, which has to be unusual for this era. Her thick black hair is swept back into a tight bun, but her heart-shaped face keeps her from looking severe. She’s not mean; she’s not motherly; she is calm personified. Her clothes look like any other woman’s from the street below, though they’re a quiet gray. Instead of the black bag doctors used to carry in the old days, she has only a notebook and pen. And instead of asking how I feel, she takes a seat in one of the chairs nearest the long velvet sofa, takes out her notebook and says, “What shall we talk about today, Your Imperial Highness?”\n\nAt first I’m just glad she said it in English. Then it hits me—she’s not a medical doctor. Dr. Nilsson is a psychiatrist.\n\nThe grand duchess came to Paris for therapy.\n\nSeems extreme to me, but then again, if social history is evolving more slowly here too, psychology would be very new to this world. There might not even be an analyst in Russia yet. Or maybe the tsar didn’t want anyone knowing his daughter is seeing a shrink.\n\nSlowly I stretch out onto the sofa, again like in movies.\n\nDr. Nilsson says only, “Your Imperial Highness?”\n\nI venture, “I guess—I guess I’m feeling, uh, conflicted about my father.”\n\n“Which one?”\n\n“Which what?”\n\n“Which father?” Dr. Nilsson keeps taking notes without ever looking up from her pad. Thank God she’s not looking at my face. Instead, she continues, “Or have you given up your fantasy that your tutor is actually your father?”\n\nIt hits me so hard I can hardly breathe. She remembered.\n\nThe selves we enter during our cross-dimensional travels aren’t supposed to remember anything we do while we’re in charge of their bodies. I’ve seen other versions of Paul and Theo who had absolutely no clue about anything that happened while my Paul and Theo were within them.\n\nBut I’m a “perfect traveler.” These voyages are different for me than they are for anyone else. Every single Marguerite I’ve ever visited must have remembered everything I did and said in her life.\n\nGrand Duchess Margarita tried to talk about what she’d experienced, which is why she wound up in therapy. Nobody believed she’d actually been taken over by a visitor from another dimension; they think she’s cracking up.\n\n“Your Imperial Highness,” Dr. Nilsson says. “Do you wish to answer the question?”\n\n“The tsar is my father,” I say in a rush. “But I’m angry with him sometimes, and it’s easy to pretend that somebody else is my father. Someone kind like Professor Caine.”\n\nDid this Marguerite tell the tsar the truth? If so, she might have doomed my father to death by firing squad.\n\nI don’t feel as if I can breathe until Dr. Nilsson says, “So it’s not a secret you were keeping. Only a secret fantasy.”\n\nDad’s safe. I breathe out in relief. “Yes.”\n\n“Good. You’re better able to face reality now. That’s progress.” Dr. Nilsson keeps taking notes. “Do you miss your father on any level?”\n\n“I miss my brothers and sister more.” That much is the absolute truth. If I could see little Peter and Katya again—talk with Vladimir one more time—that would be a gift.\n\n“And Lieutenant Markov?”\n\nAt first I think I must trust Dr. Nilsson a lot—but then I realize, after the scene I made at the army camp after Lieutenant Markov’s death, everyone must have known about us. About them. “He’s dead.”\n\n“You no longer believe he still exists in some . . . shadow world alongside our own?”\n\nI close my eyes. The grand duchess remembered everything. “It doesn’t matter if he is. I can’t reach him there. He’s—he’s very far away from me now.” My voice starts to shake. “The other Paul might not be my Paul. He might not be as loving, or as strong. As good.”\n\nShe tilts her head. It’s easy to imagine what she’s writing. Subject retains irrational belief in “shadow worlds” but has begun to say these worlds are cut off from her. She expresses no more desire to visit them. This is a transitional step toward accepting the reality of her lover’s death. “Do you still feel that one of your shadow selves took over your body nearly the entire month of December? That your actions were actually her responsibility?”\n\n“It—it seems like that’s what happened,” I venture. “But she didn’t do anything I hadn’t wanted to do.”\n\n“Do you think she might have come to see you on purpose?” Dr. Nilsson is humoring me now. “To take the actions you were afraid of? To do things otherwise forbidden?”\n\n“I need to think about that some more.”\n\nThat wins me a very slight smile. She definitely believes we’re making progress. “Have you had any dreams lately, Your Imperial Highness?”\n\nHow would I know? But the words well up anyway, spilling out to the only person I have to tell. “I dreamed that I was captured by armed men.” What’s the closest equivalent to the Russian mob in this dimension? “By soldiers loyal to the Grand Duke Sergei, the ones who rose up against us.”\n\n“What happened during your captivity, in this dream? Were you sexually violated?”\n\n“No.” Um, rude. Then again, I remember studying that the early Freudians believed absolutely everything came back to sex in the end. Dr. Nilsson’s overly personal questions are going to keep coming. “But one of the soldiers turned out to be Paul Markov.”\n\n“What role did Markov play in your dream?”\n\n“I thought he was there to protect me. To rescue me, no matter what.” I swallow hard. “Instead, he turned out to be just like all the rest. Someone else came to save me, and Paul—Paul shot him. The man who tried to save me didn’t die, but there was so much blood, and I thought he might lose his legs.”\n\nDr. Nilsson nods. “How did this make you feel?”\n\n“Guilty. Sad. Scared. Doctor, what do you think my dream means?”\n\n“Only you can answer that, Your Imperial Highness.”\n\n“I know, but—I just wondered what it looked like to you. Please tell me.”\n\nShe puts the notepad in her lap and folds her hands on top of it. Instead of answering right away, she thinks for a moment—trying to give me an honest answer.\n\nFinally she nods, as if agreeing with her own inner assessment. “Someone whom you have always regarded as a loving, protective figure instead, in your mind, became someone who could hurt you. In your dream, you only saw him attack another; this may have been your subconscious softening the blow.”\n\n“But Lieutenant Markov never would have hurt me. I know that. I know it.”\n\n“The dream of him can,” Dr. Nilsson said. “So can the illusion that you might find him again.”\n\nMy belief that Paul and I are destined to be together no matter what—that’s the illusion. It shattered along with Theo’s bones in that rain of bullets. And it feels like I’ve been destroyed along with it."

        "content": "After Dr. Nilsson leaves, I sink back onto the sofa. This enormous room’s grandeur seems to taunt me, because as beautiful as it is it’s empty. I’m alone in ways I thought I never would be again, because I always thought that even when Paul wasn’t with me, he was a part of me.\n\nBefore long I have to move on. No matter how unsure I am about Paul at this moment, I will never, ever abandon him to Conley. Yes, Theo has gone to the home office in the Triadverse; by now, Conley should have given him the coordinates for the dimension where the fourth and final splinter of Paul’s soul is hidden. I’ve done Conley’s dirty work. But Conley will never let it go at that. He’d endanger Paul again, if that was what it took to get me out of this universe and back under his thumb. So I can’t remain in Paris for much longer.\n\nWhat I need to do now is figure out what comes after.\n\nMy reverie is interrupted when the maid brings in my luncheon tray. She smiles as she delivers it to the dining area—which has a table and chairs so ornate they seem less like something you’d eat at, more like where you’d sit while writing the Constitution. I take a seat, primly as I did back in the Winter Palace, so the illusion of royalty is complete until she lifts the silver cover from the tray.\n\nWhat awaits me isn’t anything out of the ordinary—some kind of fish soup, I think, plus vegetables—but for some reason, the fishy odor hits me like a blow. Never have I smelled anything so disgusting; the scent seems to seep into my nose and lungs and gut like poison. Everything inside me turns over, tightens.\n\nMy stomach wrenches as the nausea turns from figurative to literal.\n\n“I’m going to throw up,” I say. The maid skitters back as I push away from the table and make a run for the nearest bathroom. I make it just in time to barf into the sink.\n\nThe smell of my own vomit almost makes me sick again. And in the bathroom there’s the scent of cleanser, and perfumed soap that for some reason now seems repulsive—I can’t stand it. Weakly I stumble out of there, and the maid gets me back to my bedroom. “I’ll leave your luncheon under the tray. If you want another later, ring,” she says as she backs out and closes the door behind her.\n\nI flop onto my bed, now too queasy to be miserable about anything else.\n\nIt would serve me right, if after everything else I put the grand duchess through, I had to endure her bout of the flu. Groaning, I roll onto my stomach—but my breasts are tender, and I wince.\n\nMy eyes open wide.\n\nThe grand duchess has gained weight. Mom and I have the same problem: we almost can’t gain weight. Don’t even give me that crap about boo hoo hoo that’s not a real problem eat a sandwich. Easy to say when you’re not slightly wired all the time by your crazy metabolism. My body simply burns too many calories, too fast.\n\nBut here I am in a body that’s heavier. Some of that weight is in my breasts, which must be a cup size larger. My sense of smell has turned sharp, and I’m vomiting for no reason at all.\n\nThree months after Lieutenant Markov and I slept together.\n\nOh God. I’m pregnant.\n\n20\n\nI CAN’T BE HAVING A BABY. I CAN’T.\n\nI sit on my bed, hands on either side of my head, trying to talk myself out of it. Maybe you’re premenstrual. That would explain the boobs, plus my belly could be water weight. But my body never reacted like that to PMS before. Mostly I just break out, and start crying at the least little thing. You could have the stomach flu. That would explain why you’re throwing up. People don’t usually gain weight when they have stomach flu, do they?\n\nAll my denials fail. The truth is unmistakable on some level that goes beyond logic or even emotion; my body is telling me something that outweighs anything my brain could say. I’m pregnant, for real.\n\nSlowly I reach down to splay my hand across my belly. No, it doesn’t yet look like I have a “baby bump,” but the weight I’ve gained there has a certain . . . solidity. A firmness that fat doesn’t have. I don’t feel the baby moving, but maybe I wouldn’t yet.\n\nDoes anyone know I’m having a baby? No—they can’t. Dr. Nilsson would have asked me how I felt about it. The tsar? I shudder at the thought. He probably would’ve locked me in a convent, if not a prison cell.\n\nI’m horrified because this isn’t my body. I did this to the Grand Duchess Margarita. I made the decision, I slept with Paul, and now—\n\nHow smug I was, telling Theo how hard we tried to do right by the other selves we visit. I’m so full of it. I took more than this Marguerite’s only night with the man she loved; I took away her choices.\n\nAs bad as it would be for me to be pregnant at eighteen, for the grand duchess it’s about ten thousand times worse. This society believes in virginity until marriage—for women, anyway, because they’ve got all the nineteenth-century hypocrisy to go with the nineteenth-century tech. And the tsar wanted to marry me off to the Prince of Wales! I’m pretty sure showing up with an illegitimate child wasn’t part of that deal.\n\nI have already endangered you, Lieutenant Markov whispered to me that night as we lay together in bed. He understood this society; he knew the risks. And he had the sense to fear the consequences.\n\nNo, I was the careless one. And these are the consequences.\n\nI flop back onto the bed, and close my eyes tightly as if I’m holding back tears. But the remorse goes too deep for me to cry about it. There’s nothing I can do to help her. Nothing. I have to assume she doesn’t want to terminate the pregnancy, because surely she’d have done it by now if she could.\n\nThis must be why the grand duchess came to Paris. She knew she was in trouble, so she ran all the way across Europe. Obviously she needed to get out of Russia before her pregnancy began to show, before the tsar or any of the court nobles could guess the truth. Once the king of England learned that the grand duchess was not exactly sane—the engagement would be called off long before the truth could be revealed, and that would buy her more time.\n\nThe grand duchess might be smarter than I am.\n\nI put my hand back over my belly, still trying to convince myself that there’s an actual baby in there. Paul’s baby. Paul’s and mine, together.\n\nOn the night my parents were such bad role models about Paul and me getting together, my mother wound up saying to me that the real reason he and I shouldn’t have a baby together yet didn’t have anything to do with our education or our careers, as important as those things are. She said, When you have a child with someone, you’re bound to them forever. That can be beautiful and miraculous, and yet a burden, too—the knowledge that your life is intertwined with another’s, for all time. It transforms your relationship in ways I can’t begin to describe.\n\nBefore you take that step with someone, you must be ready to accept the destruction of the life you had together beforehand—and have faith that what you two create afterward can be even greater.\n\nThere is no “afterward” for the grand duchess and Lieutenant Markov. That night in the dacha was all they ever had.\n\nI remember the way he held me, and whispered against my temple, calling me his little dove. Even though that Paul is dead, something of him lives on. He’ll have a son or a daughter, someone who might have his gray eyes and his good mind. When I imagine holding that baby in my arms, I know—beyond any doubt—that the grand duchess wants this child."

        "content": "But I now know something she doesn’t: Paul Markov is more than the shy, devoted lieutenant I fell in love with in St. Petersburg. He can be cold, cruel. He could be a murderer.\n\nOn the train to Moscow, when the uprising began, Lieutenant Markov shot a guard who would have killed me and Katya. Since then I’ve remembered that moment as proof of how protective he is, how he would do anything to keep me safe. Now I remember how he never even looked down at the man he’d shot, bleeding to death at his feet.\n\nThe afternoon passes in a kind of daze. It feels like hours before I even move from my bed, and I do that only when I realize I’ll be more nauseated if I don’t eat than if I do. Every action I could possibly take—even something as inconsequential as sitting at the window to look out at the Place Vendôme—seems as if it could backfire disastrously. This is ridiculous, of course; watching the Paris scene is a lot less risky than having unprotected sex. But after screwing up this badly, I don’t trust myself right now. Guilt paralyzes me.\n\nAs the pale sunlight begins to dim at dusk, the maid arrives to prepare me “for dinner.” I remember the line in my planner—tonight I’m dining at the home of someone called Maxim. I wish I could tell the maid to go away, burrow back under the silk coverlet, and try to shut out the reality I’m in, the one I created for the grand duchess.\n\nBut I’ve screwed up her plans enough for one lifetime. The least I can do is keep her appointments.\n\nI submit to the maid’s ministrations. While she’s not the equal of the attendants I had in St. Petersburg, she shares their knack for making the most out of my few good features. My curly hair is tamed into a soft cloud by ornate gold combs, enameled with cobalt-blue lotuses that seem vaguely Egyptian. The dress she gives me is a darker shade of blue, beaded with jet, and while it fits snugly around my newly acquired bustline, it flows down beneath that in loose folds. Even the closest observer wouldn’t be able to spot the slight thickness at my middle.\n\nI watch the maid carefully, wondering if her eyes will linger at my waist. Whether she knows. If so, she’s too smart to give any sign.\n\nShe’s not one of the women who attended me in St. Petersburg, I remind myself. I don’t know how long I’ve been in Paris, but I almost certainly wouldn’t have left until after I was sure of my pregnancy, so no more than a month to six weeks. The maid doesn’t realize my body doesn’t always look like this.\n\nThat buys me time, but how much? Another month, at most—\n\nFor jewelry, the maid chooses heavy, screw-on earrings of black pearls and a ruby ring so enormous it dwarfs my skinny fingers. (The Firebird remains around my neck, all but hidden under the dark gauze at the dress’s neckline, unnoticed by the maid.) Then dark slippers are slid onto my feet, an elaborately beaded bag is put in my hands, and a heavy wrap of burgundy velvet and black fur is draped around my shoulders.\n\nTurns out I’m staying in the “Suite Imperial,” but the rest of the Ritz is nearly as swanky as my rooms. Red carpet, gilded ceilings—the splendor doesn’t quite reach the levels of the Winter Palace, but it comes pretty close.\n\nThe doors that separate my area of the hotel from the rest swing open to reveal two large, stern men dressed in black. Instantly I realize they’re my personal guard. I remember Lieutenant Markov, always standing at my door, always protecting me, his gray eyes searching mine every time we dared look at each other.\n\n“Your Imperial Highness?” says one of the guards. “Are you unwell?”\n\nI’ve stopped in my tracks, one hand over my heart. Through the beaded gauze of my dress I can feel my Firebird. “I’m very well, thank you. We can leave now.”\n\nThey shepherd me through a corridor that offers only a glance of the opulent lobby, but I glimpse women in dresses as elaborate as mine, men in tuxedos and the occasional top hat. A rush of whispers trails behind me like smoke. If this dimension’s technology had developed as quickly as our own, paparazzi camera flashes would light up around me. I have to maintain a neutral, pleasant expression even though on the inside I feel like crying.\n\nThe car is a low-to-the-ground roadster with running boards and a canvas top, the kind of thing they’d drive on Downton Abbey. Numbly I lean back in my seat and take in the view of this wholly different Paris. A few horse-drawn carts still travel on the streets, most of them apparently bringing in agricultural products from the countryside. I see one stacked with old-fashioned metal milk jars, another laden with enormous wheels of cheese. Stores and shops are smaller and darker, and each one looks individual, with hand-painted signs advertising their wares.\n\nMost people I see on the street aren’t dressed as elegantly as those of us staying in the Ritz, but compared to the fashions I’m used to back home, everyone looks more formal. Every man has a jacket and a necktie, even the ones walking into pubs with their friends. Every woman wears a long skirt, most of them with elaborate hats to match. Nobody eats or sips coffee while they walk; instead of cell phones or plastic shopping bags, they hold walking sticks, or fans.\n\nI expect the car to pull up in front of some mansion or stately apartment building, wherever the mysterious Maxim lives. Instead, we stop at an enormous gaudy neon sign over what looks like the biggest, most bustling restaurant in the city: Maxim’s.\n\n“Your Imperial Highness! Welcome back.” This man in the tuxedo must be the maître’d, or the owner. Whoever he is, he’s really glad to see me. No wonder—having a Russian princess as a regular customer must be great advertising. “Your private room awaits you.”\n\n“Thank you,” I say evenly, trying to disguise my relief. Whoever I’m meeting here, I won’t be able to miss them, and any little mistakes I make won’t be noticed by as many people in a private area. Either way, the delicious smells of beef and bread and cheese make my mouth water; my earlier nausea has given way to intense hunger.\n\nMaxim’s turns out to be almost as lush as the Ritz. Sinuously carved frames surround long oval mirrors that hang throughout the hall. The wood that panels the walls ripples in gold and brown as if it were tortoiseshell. Light shines from flower-shaped lamps held by bronze angels or through the enormous stained glass mural overhead. The other patrons are a blur of fur, satin, jewels, and candlelight.\n\nThe doors open to reveal an intimate dining room, complete with bookshelves and a chaise longue. At one end of the small table, rising to greet me, is the last person I expected.\n\n“Your Imperial Highness,” says Theo. “How enchanting to see you again.”\n\nThe next brief flurry of activity—accepting menus and the fawning team of waiters—gives me a second to take this in. After leaving Theo in New York, where he was bruised and bloody, just the sight of him alive and well buoys me. And yet he’s not precisely the Theo I know.\n\nHis suit is black, cut closer to the body than most men’s seem to be—an avant-garde style, I’d guess. He has facial hair, which I find sort of hilarious even though the mustache and Vandyke beard look good on him. He’s combed his hair back with that oil or pomade or whatever men used for gel back in the day. He speaks French to the waiters but English to me—with a slight Dutch accent. I’ve heard my own voice change accents before, but hearing someone else’s change is even weirder.\n\nYet the way he smiles, the flourish when he hands the wine list back to the waiter, even the slightly rakish tilt of the deep red scarf knotted around his neck: All of that is very familiar."

        "content": "I knew Theo lived in Paris; I hadn’t forgotten the letters he sent me while I was in St. Petersburg, talking about the Moulin Rouge. But it hadn’t occurred to me to look Theo up, mostly because I can’t figure out how they would know each other. It’s not like our Russiaverse selves have anything in common. Theo is a leading student of chemistry; I’m a member of royalty from the other side of the continent.\n\nTogether we fight crime, I think, and my own stupid joke makes me silly. I muffle my laugh with my lace handkerchief, trying to make it sound like a cough.\n\n“Your Imperial Highness?” Theo asks as the waiters step out of the room, closing the doors behind them. Though my security detail waits just outside, for now Theo and I are alone. “Are you well?”\n\n“Very well, thank you.” How do I put this? “I’m just—I’ve been absentminded lately, and I completely forgot what you and I had intended to talk about—”\n\nHis eyes widen. “The amnesia has affected you again?”\n\n“Amnesia?”\n\nTheo nods, like he knows he needs to take this slowly. His voice is patient as he says, “The malady overtook me in December. It was during this time I wrote to you, forging our acquaintance. You contacted me in January with your intriguing ideas about our other selves who knew one another, the shadow worlds—”\n\nShe remembered everything. “Shadow worlds,” I repeat.\n\n“If your theory is correct,” Theo says, “it was my shadow-self who inhabited my body last December, acting in my stead. Do you remember none of this?”\n\nThen he sits up straighter, his smile fading. He’s guessed the truth, now; the only way to keep his trust is to admit it.\n\n“As a matter of fact, I’m from one of the—shadow worlds,” I say. “I don’t mean any harm, to the grand duchess or you or anyone.”\n\nBesides Wyatt Conley. But he doesn’t count.\n\nTheo doesn’t know what to make of that, and no wonder. After a moment he says, “Can you explain the scientific principles at work?”\n\nAs in my universe, he’s a hipster on the outside, pure science geek on the inside. “Not very well. But I’ll try.” I don’t know what else to say. “Why did the grand duchess contact you?”\n\n“To see if my impressions of December’s events matched her own. She did not share my total amnesia, but as outlandish as her explanation was, I came to believe it.”\n\nIn other words, she had to check to make sure she was sane. The letters I exchanged with Theo last December were the only proof she had that the shadow worlds were more than a delusion.\n\nAmazement has animated Theo, turned him into a guy closer to one I know. “Do you perhaps have one of those miraculous devices?”\n\n“A Firebird.” I snag my finger under the chain. It takes him a moment to focus on material from another dimension, but his expression lights up when he does. I add, “If you ever need to check whether someone is native to this dimension, you can look for a Firebird. They’ll almost certainly have it on.”\n\nI tug at his collar, as an example of how to check, but to my shock, I see another Firebird chain.\n\n“Your Imperial Highness?” Theo says, still unaware anything is hanging around his neck.\n\nI snatch up his Firebird, hit the reminder sequence, and—\n\n“Owwww!” Theo pushes back, grabs his chest, and then looks around at our opulent surroundings. “Whoa. Okay, I don’t know where we are, but I like it.”\n\n“What are you doing here?” I demand. “Did you already talk to Conley?”\n\n“Hello to you, too.” When I give him a look, he sighs. “No, I didn’t go to the coordinates you gave me. Instead, I followed you.”\n\n“We were supposed to go to him after we were done!”\n\n“Which we will. He never said we couldn’t take a short detour first.”\n\nFrustration tightens my fist around the lace handkerchief I’m still clutching. “What if Conley thinks we’re skipping out on him? He could splinter Paul into another four pieces—” Or four dozen. Or four million, so I’d never get him back again.\n\n“Hey,” Theo says sharply. “You’re the one Conley’s after. This train doesn’t move forward unless you’re aboard. Besides, as far as Conley knows, we’ve been good little soldiers so far. He’s not going to break the deal yet.”\n\nHe doesn’t know that any more than I do. Still, I sense he’s right—for now. Conley won’t put up with a delay for long. “You understand why I came to this dimension, right?”\n\nTheo nods, but his smile fades. “Yeah, I know. You needed to get your head together. What happened in New York—that was intense.”\n\n“More for you than for me,” I say.\n\n“We can save the Most Traumatized competition for later, all right? Okay, you wanted to rest someplace—luxurious, I guess, someplace where you knew you’d be safe.”\n\n“You think I came here because it was ‘luxurious’?”\n\nTheo holds out his hands in a way that takes in the crystal chandelier above us, the painted murals on the walls, all of it, like, Am I wrong? But he adds, “And you needed to be safe. Right? Otherwise it has to be sad for you, remembering—you know. The other Paul.”\n\nHe honestly doesn’t get it. “Theo, I came to this dimension because it’s the only one where I knew I wouldn’t see Paul. I couldn’t even look at him, not after what he did to you.”\n\nTheo winces; he covers one knee with his hand. “That sucked beyond the telling of it. But it’s not like our Paul shot me.”\n\n“The different versions—they’re more alike than unalike. Don’t you see that?”\n\n“What, so, if one Paul did something crappy to me, I should hate every version of Paul from then on?”\n\n“That’s not what I meant.”\n\nThe flickering gas lamps on the walls no longer seem to shed enough light. Instead of appearing luxurious, the heavy wood carving and enormous overhead chandelier begin to make me feel claustrophobic. A gilded cage is still a cage.\n\nSlowly I say, “Theo, the first time I came to this world—this is where I began to believe that no matter how different we are in each dimension, something within us is always the same. Call it an eternal soul, or a spirit, but whatever it is, it’s the most important thing about us, and that’s the constant. That’s the part that never changes, no matter what.”\n\n“The soul,” Theo says, in a tone of voice I’ve heard my whole life from my parents and every single one of their grad students; it means, This is not science.\n\nSometimes they think nothing but hard, empirical fact matters.\n\nWhich is total crap.\n\n“Yes,” I shoot back. “The soul. And I thought I knew Paul’s soul even better than I knew my own. But when he shot you, I realized there were ways I don’t know him at all. I’ve seen darkness inside him. True darkness. And I still love him, which is scarier than anything else. But I don’t know what to think or what to do—”\n\nMy throat closes up, and I blink back tears. Pregnancy hormones, I think.\n\nTheo doesn’t even know about the baby yet.\n\nI look up at him for comfort, then pull back, because at this moment Theo is furious."

        "content": "“One eternal soul,” he whispers. The very quietness of his voice cuts me, as it’s meant to. “Only one self, across the countless dimensions of the multiverse, and we all have to answer for each other’s sins. Which means, to you, I’m still the Theo who helped kidnap your dad, and framed Paul for murder. The one who betrayed you. When you look at me, that’s all you see.”\n\nI want to say, No, that’s not true. But I can’t. Still, when I look at Theo, I feel a flicker of doubt.\n\nOnly now do I realize that I’m the one who betrayed Theo. By refusing to see him for himself, to respect the choices he’s made and the loyalty he’s shown, I’m betraying him this very second.\n\n“That Paul isn’t our Paul,” Theo says. By now he’s so mad he seems to be staring through me, like I’m beneath even being noticed. “Just like I’m not that Theo. He didn’t blame me for something an entirely different Theo did, and I won’t blame him for what happened in New York. Dammit, Marguerite, I’m the one who got shot! If I can let it go, why can’t you?”\n\nHe rises to his feet and shoves his chair to the table. Apparently the grand duchess will dine alone tonight.\n\nTheo continues, “Believe what you want to believe. Doubt me, doubt Paul, hide in fin de siècle Paris if it makes you feel better. But if you won’t save Paul, I will.”\n\nWith that, he stalks out of the private dining room.\n\nNow it’s just me and the flickering gaslight. I lost Paul three times over—when Lieutenant Markov died in this dimension, when Wyatt Conley splintered his soul, and when I saw Paul shoot Theo. Now I’ve lost Theo, too.\n\nNever, in any world, have I been so alone.\n\n21\n\nWHEN DAWN BREAKS THE NEXT DAY, I HAVEN’T SLEPT MORE than a few hours. Exhaustion weighs down my body and paints dark circles beneath my eyes.\n\nPartly this is because of my pregnancy. At least I assume that’s why I have to get up to pee about every two hours.\n\nI thought babies only kept you awake after they were born.\n\nMostly, though, my insomnia comes from guilt. The many reasons boil inside my mind, hot and agitated, and as soon as I’ve set one aside, another bubbles up to take its place.\n\nI got the grand duchess pregnant. The worst thing I’ve ever done. Hopefully the worst thing I’ll ever do. How much worse than that could I even get?\n\nTheo thinks I’ve spent the last three months hating him. I could never hate Theo. Not even after what the other one put me through, with his careful lies, the way he set up my entire family and Paul too, or how he cozied up to me by flirting and leaning close and calling me “Meg.” (Even the thought of that nickname makes my skin crawl.) After the past few days, I know more than ever how much Theo’s done for me, how much more he would give. How could I ever have doubted him because of something that happened to him? He was the main victim of the Triadverse’s Theo—not me, not my mom, not even my kidnapped father.\n\nTheo and I didn’t move on to the home office. Conley probably thinks we’ve abandoned Paul. I haven’t—I never would. Even if I’m not sure how to be with him again, there’s no way I’m not going to bring him home.\n\nI’m letting the actions of another Paul affect my emotions about my Paul, the one I love. After Theo’s blistering lecture last night, I realize how cruel and unjust that is. Yet my heart remembers the homicidal dullness in Paul’s eyes as he shot Theo over and over again.\n\nAfter what feels like an endless weak sunrise, I finally accept sleep isn’t going to happen. I wrap myself in the velvet robe and wander through the palatial Suite Imperial, wishing for some way to kill time. Sure, there are books on the shelves—histories and encyclopedias of this alternate timeline that would probably fascinate my parents. The kind of thing I ought to take notes on, but I can’t, not with my mind racing like this.\n\nNo TV or computer, obviously. Life before Wi-Fi was a barren time.\n\nFinally, I look at the grand duchess’s sketchbook and pastels. I’ve avoided opening the sketchbook, because I’m completely certain Paul’s portrait is on those pages. I’m not ready to see his face looking up at me, not yet. But I remember Lieutenant Markov giving me the box of pastels—the light in his eyes as he realized how much I loved his Christmas gift. Surely I could draw one picture with them, just one.\n\nI pick up the sketchbook, determined to flip through quickly to a blank page so I won’t see anything drawn within. But as soon as I take it from the desk, folded papers fall out onto the floor. As I squint down at them, I see how many of them are letters.\n\nAm I violating the grand duchess’s privacy if I read them? Compared to the fact that I’m walking around in her body, which I also got pregnant, going over the mail doesn’t seem like a big deal. Besides, maybe the letters will tell me what she’s planning—what’s going to become of her.\n\nThe first one I open, written in badly blotted ink, is from Katya, the bratty little sister who might have saved my life during the rebellion by tackling an enemy soldier twice her size:\n\nI told you to be quiet about that “shadow world” stuff, but you never listen to me. Simply tell them it’s all a story you made up, so you can come home. Papa says it’s not proper for me to attend balls while you’re seeing your French doctor, and I’m tired of sitting around every night. Will you at least be home by the time we go to Tsarskoye Selo for the summer? You always enjoy that.\n\nI smile softly; Katya misses me, though she won’t admit it. I’ve missed her too.\n\nBut—summertime. I do what the other Marguerite must have done the first time realization set in, counting off weeks and months to late September. How can I possibly hide this pregnancy for so long?\n\nIf I could solve these problems for her, I would—but I can’t. I’m not sure anybody can.\n\nThe next letter turns out to be more comforting; it’s from my little brother, Peter.\n\nMargarita, I wish you were here. I’m studying hard and Professor Caine is helping me draw a map of Africa. Papa has a lion skin from the time he went shooting in Africa when he was young, but I think it was mean to kill the lion just to take its skin. If I ever go to Africa, I’ll take photographs of the animals, because that way the animals will be happy and I can still look at them forever. Also the lion skin smells nasty now. Please come home from France soon. I love you.\n\nA laugh bubbles up in my chest as I envision Peter’s sweet little face while he labored to write each word. He’s so tiny for his age, or he was; maybe he’s grown since.\n\nI pick up the next letter, relieved and grateful to recognize my father’s handwriting. Though, of course, this letter is signed from my “tutor,” Henry Caine.\n\nYour Imperial Highness,\n\nI’m glad to hear that your time in Paris has proved beneficial, as we discussed. Although the tsar has expressed impatience, I’ve endeavored to convince him that psychotherapy has genuine medical value, and that your convalescence should not be rushed.\n\nAs we speculated, the king of England appears to have turned his attentions toward the Rumanian princess for his son’s bride. The tsar feels this keenly, but your health outweighs all other considerations. Besides, now that Vladimir is courting that Polish princess, I suspect Tsar Alexander has matchmaking enough for now."

Let me know how you’re feeling, and whether I can send you anything you might need.\n\nThis letter says far more than it first appears to.\n\nIf this world’s Marguerite remembers her night with Paul, that means she also remembers the truth about her parentage, which was the result of a brief, clandestine affair between the late tsaritsa, my mother, and the royal tutor, Henry Caine. She’s kept the secret, and she and Dad have built a relationship.\n\nThe Grand Duchess Margarita finally has a dad who loves her. I cling to this, the one thing I’ve given her after taking so much else away.\n\nDad clearly knows about the pregnancy, too. A grandchild, he wrote. Probably he helped devise this plan to get the grand duchess out of the tsar’s sight for a long while.\n\nBut if my father has any ideas about what happens next, they’re not in this letter.\n\nHearing from Katya and Peter warms me more than I could have anticipated. I’ve missed them ever since I left the Russiaverse, which was one thing none of the others ever fully understood. You only knew them for a month, Josie said once, irritated. They weren’t your siblings like I am. Come on!\n\nThey weren’t, and they were. There’s a kind of magic to seeing yourself reflected in this entirely new person. When you’re related to someone, you wind up sometimes connecting in ways that go beyond logic. I didn’t just fall in love with Paul in Russia; in some ways, I fell in love with my other family, too. All of them.\n\nI go through all the fallen letters time and time again, searching for one from my older brother, Vladimir, heir to the throne. It breaks my heart when I don’t find one.\n\nHe’d write. He would. Vladimir’s kindness was nearly the first thing I noticed about him. Whenever I wished I had a protective, loving big brother instead of the big sister who wouldn’t let me use her skateboard, I envisioned someone exactly like Vladimir. And this Marguerite is close to her brother—that was obvious from the beginning.\n\nThey’re close enough that she would have told him about the pregnancy.\n\nAnd he’s said . . . nothing.\n\nVladimir hardly seems like the Scarlet Letter type, but I have to remember what a different world this is. Their morality resembles that of a century back, when people thought racism was A-OK but freaked out about premarital sex. Would he hate her for that? Even if he didn’t, Vladimir might feel that he had to cut her off, possibly forever.\n\nDid I cost this Marguerite her brother, too?\n\nThroughout the day, I keep expecting Theo to call—not literally, as the Suite Imperial doesn’t have a phone, but by sending a message via the hotel. I check the appointment book, hoping to see more restaurant bookings, but there’s only one note, and that’s for tomorrow: Word from Cousin Karin. Though I search my memories, I can’t recall writing a note to any “Karin” when I was in this dimension in December; then again, I’m supposedly related to half the royal families in Europe, so that could be anyone.\n\nNot one line tells me when—or if—I’ll see Theo again.\n\nCould I ask one of the security guards to track down the chemist Theo Beck? Maybe. But I’m not sure how much they know about the grand duchess’s friendship with this world’s Theo, or how much they’ll report back to the tsar. I need to be discreet if at all possible. If only I had some idea where Theo might be, or when—\n\n—but then I realize, I do know. Really, I should’ve been able to guess on my own, but Theo himself told me in one of his letters in December.\n\nSo when night falls, I eat an early supper in my room and have my maid fix me up to go out (this time a dress in dark red velvet, with kimono-style sleeves, subtle gold embroidery on the chest, and black fur trim at the hem). Then I call for my car.\n\n“Where to, Your Imperial Highness?” the chauffeur asks.\n\nIt’s kind of a thrill to reply, “The Moulin Rouge.”\n\nWhen we drive up, I hardly know what to look at first: the red windmill sign, the mix of hoi polloi and bohemians streaming through the doors, or—holy cow, a ginormous statue of an elephant with a pagoda on its back. I thought that was something made up for the movie. Guess not.\n\nAs I walk inside, I spot clues that I haven’t merely stepped back in time. I see several people of color—black, East Asian, Indian—and while a few are obviously entertainers, others are well-heeled guests. I bet that wasn’t as common back home; points go to this universe for not being as racist. Plus there’s a vivid poster on the wall in a kind of Art Nouveau style, featuring a beautiful woman with dark skin wearing a golden dress that glitters with a thousand lights; her hair curls around her in sinuous curves that remind me of Medusa’s snakes. The name written at the top, in flowing elaborate type, is Beyoncé. At the bottom of the poster are the dates of her next performance.\n\nMostly, though, the scene is pure bacchanal. The club is enormous—and hundreds of people dance on the wooden floors or cheer from the balconies. A full orchestra crashes its way through a number that it takes me a moment to recognize as a Taylor Swift song, which in this universe she apparently wrote for the cancan.\n\nMy guards don’t look thrilled to have escorted me anyplace so bawdy, but at least one of them has fetched a person in charge. I nod politely as he welcomes me, then say, “Can you show me where Mr. Theo Beck is? The chemist? I know he comes here often. Is he in tonight?”\n\n“But of course! Let me show you to the Jardin de Paris.”\n\nThis turns out to be the back patio of the Moulin Rouge. The elephant towers over the scene while frilly-skirted dancers cavort on an outdoor stage, brightly colored feathers in their hair. Everyone around us is eating, drinking, laughing, smoking cigarettes, smoking stuff that might not be cigarettes . . .\n\nSitting at the end of the farthest table with nothing but bottles and a glass for company, is Theo. His ascot is askew; his hat is missing. I’d guess he’s already sampled the bottles.\n\nI motion for my guards to step back. They’re not thrilled, but they obey. Alone, I go to Theo’s table and take the seat closest to him.\n\nHe doesn’t look at me as I approach, but he must have recognized me just from the corner of his eye. “Interesting place,” he says. “Paris.”\n\n“If you know where to go,” I reply.\n\nTheo points at the elephant. “For the price of one franc—just one franc!—I can go inside the elephant. It has stairs in one of its legs, you see. If you climb up there, you’re entertained by belly dancers who’ll give you all the opium you want.”\n\n“You’ve gone up already?” The last thing I need is Theo getting high while we need to concentrate.\n\nBut he shakes his head. “Just what I’ve been told.” Then he pulls himself together, or tries to. “Can I fix you a drink?”\n\nInstinctively, my hand covers my stomach. “No, thanks.”\n\n“C’mon. You’ll never have another chance to drink absinthe like this. Yeah, you can get it back home, but they don’t brew it the old way, with the wormwood. So you don’t get the hallucinogenic quality.” As if he hadn’t heard my refusal, Theo slides his empty glass between us, then pours in what I assume is absinthe—a pale green liquor the exact same shade as peridot. Then he puts a strange, perforated piece of silver atop the rim, and sets a single sugar cube atop that."

        "content": "“Next comes the ice water,” Theo says as he lifts a bottle, frosted by its inner chill. “You have to go slowly if you want to do it right. Drop by drop, until the sugar cube dissolves.”\n\n“How long have you been practicing this?” I demand.\n\n“Most of the night,” Theo admits. Though he never takes his eyes off the water dripping onto the sugar cube, he adds, more quietly, “Listen—some of the stuff I said yesterday—I was out of line.”\n\n“No, you weren’t.” After I finally admitted it to myself, admitting it to Theo is easy. “I’ve been unfair to you. I let the things that other Theo did keep me from seeing you. The real you, I mean. This whole trip, you’ve proved that you’re one of the most courageous, loyal, good people I’ve ever met.”\n\nTheo’s never been shy; he loves being praised. That’s what makes it so astonishing when he actually blushes. “Thanks. You’re not so bad yourself.”\n\n“Please. I’ve been such an idiot.”\n\n“Hey. None of that.” His laugh is sloppy from the absinthe, but the sincerity comes through. “Seeing you in action like this—Marguerite, it’s been incredible. The way you jumped in after the bomb during that air raid; you were bandaging wounds while I was still pissing myself with terror.”\n\nI can’t help laughing. “Not literally.”\n\n“Close. You don’t want to know how close.” By now Theo has begun to smile, a lopsided, absinthe-tilted grin. “You size up these dimensions so fast. You hit the ground running. Hell, you got kidnapped by the freakin’ Russian mafia and you escaped on your own!”\n\n“You pried off the metal grid.”\n\n“Okay, you only did ninety-nine percent of it.” He takes a deep breath. “Yeah, you drive me crazy sometimes. But you’re amazing. I think you’re the most incredible person I’ve ever known.”\n\nThis conversation feels like it’s going in a direction it maybe shouldn’t go in. So I say, “You’re right. We should go on to the home office, so we can reach the last dimension with Paul.”\n\n“Always Paul. You keep finding him in dimension after dimension. That’s got to be destiny, right?”\n\n“Maybe,” I say, though it’s hard for me to believe in destiny right now.\n\nTheo’s eyes meet mine. “But it seems like you find me almost as often.”\n\n“Yeah. I guess I do.”\n\nSuddenly I want to tell Theo about the pregnancy. Talking it over with someone would help, and he’d understand more of why I’ve been feeling so confused. As I open my mouth, though, Theo puts down the water bottle—sugar cube only halfway dissolved—and takes one of my hands in both of his. “Listen,” he says. “I’m just drunk enough to say this, so I’m going to say it, and then we can move on. Okay?”\n\nOh no. But I can only answer, “Okay.”\n\n“I love Paul as much as if he’d been born my brother. And—and I think you know by now that I love you too. Not exactly like a sister.”\n\n“Theo—”\n\nHe holds up one hand, determined to finish. “Hopefully we’re always going to be a part of each other’s lives. You, me, and Paul, all three. If you and Paul work this out, if you end up together, then I’m happy for you. And I’ll be your good buddy Theo forever and ever, et cetera.” Theo takes a deep breath, as if trying to clear his thoughts from the fog of absinthe. Nearby, accordions play and people dance, the hubbub swirling around me and Theo without ever touching us. “But maybe—maybe you and Paul don’t end up together.”\n\nEven two weeks ago, I would have laughed at the idea of Paul and me drifting apart. We were destined, I thought. Fated. Eternal. Now the future stretches before me, blank and unknowable.\n\nTheo speeds up as he gets the final words out. “I’m not the kind of guy who’d try to break up someone else’s relationship, even if the ‘other man’ wasn’t my best friend. And I am one hundred percent positive that you shouldn’t split up with Paul because of what some other guy with his face did in another dimension. But—if that’s not all there is to it, if your relationship with Paul isn’t what you thought it was and you walk away—well. After the so-called ‘decent interval,’ if you think you might be interested . . .” Our eyes meet again, and he smiles, and then his voice breaks. “I know I would be.”\n\nPeople talk about their heart being torn in two, but I always thought it was a metaphor, no more. But it really feels like that, like something precious at the core of me is being ripped into halves, neither of them complete.\n\nHe lifts my hand to his mouth. The brush of his lips against my fingers is featherlight—the ghost of a kiss, over in an instant, and then he lets go.\n\n“That’s enough serious talk for tonight,” Theo says, suddenly glib again. He laughs—too loud and hard to sound real—as he resumes pouring the water over the sugar cube. “See how the absinthe is turning that milky color? Like an opal. That’s how you know it’s ready to drink. Can’t wait to give you your first glass of this stuff.”\n\n“I’m not drinking,” I say.\n\n“Hey, no legal drinking age here. Or if there is one, we’re both over it.”\n\nI just blurt out the words: “I’m pregnant.”\n\nTheo laughs again—but then his face falls as he realizes I’m serious. His jaw drops, and he whispers, “Oh, my God.”\n\nThe music and laughter around us seem to taunt me, and all I know is that I want out of here. I push back my chair and return to my guards. “Take me back to the Ritz immediately.”\n\nThey begin shepherding me out under the watchful eyes of the elephant. Only once do I glance over my shoulder at Theo, just in time to watch him down the glass of absinthe in one gulp.\n\n22\n\nTHE ENTIRE DRIVE HOME, I TALK TO MYSELF. IT’S NOT LIKE you didn’t know Theo had feelings for you. He’d said so before.\n\nI also argue with myself. Not like that! Theo never laid it out there like that, not even once.\n\nTheo’s confession moved me, but it changes nothing. I hurt for him without longing for him; I love him without wanting to be with him romantically. Even when I reached out for him in London that one night, I just wanted comfort and closeness, and in my drunken grief, sex was the only way I knew to ask for that. His feelings tear me apart inside because they force me to hurt someone I care about so much.\n\nBut that’s not the only reason I was so shaken tonight. Not the reason I reacted so strongly to the relationship between the Marguerite and Theo of the Warverse. It’s not that I want to choose Theo instead of Paul—it’s that I’ve seen another choice is possible.\n\nDo Paul and I truly share a destiny in every world, every life? Or is he just one of a thousand potential paths for my life? Theo Beck may be another path, another choice made by Marguerites in other worlds; I understand that now, but my heart still tries to deny it. Paul believes in destiny. I want to believe too.\n\nEven after the blood and the betrayal, the emptiness inside me yearns for Paul. Only Paul.\n\nAnd the way I told Theo about the pregnancy—could that have been any clumsier? I don’t think so. Not without my actually vomiting or something. At the time I felt like I had to say something, anything, to change the subject from Theo’s confession. Well, it worked."

        "content": "Maybe it’s just as well that I got it over with quickly and left Theo to deal with it on his own. By the time we discuss my pregnancy again, Theo will have had time to come up with some jokes and some theories and all the other things he uses to shield himself. He’s more vulnerable than he lets on.\n\nWhat will Paul say when I break the news? Although I know him more intimately—more than Theo, more than anyone else—I can’t imagine his reaction. But of course I have to tell him. My Paul was within Lieutenant Markov, a part of him, when this child was conceived.\n\n“Your Imperial Highness?” my driver says. “Are you well?”\n\nOnly then do I realize I’ve started crying into my handkerchief. I just shake my head. Let the chauffeur make what he can out of that.\n\nWalking back into the Suite Imperial at the Ritz feels like stepping within the walls of a gilded fortress. In some ways, I’m locked in, but at least the rest of the world is locked out tonight . . . or so I think, before I see the potted orchids on the desk next to a small yellow envelope. A card on the flowers says: With regards.\n\nI rip open the envelope. When I pull out the thin yellow paper inside, I realize it’s a telegram, the first real one I’ve ever seen. Each word is written in flat block capitals. Yet before I read anything else, I see the name of the sender: WYATT CONLEY, NEW YORK CITY.\n\nHe’s a millionaire inventor in this dimension, someone this world’s Marguerite has never had the slightest contact with. So I know the sender isn’t this universe’s Conley, and the message isn’t meant for the grand duchess. It’s for me.\n\nYOU FOUND A LOOPHOLE IN MY RULES -(STOP)- VERY CLEVER -(STOP)- DON’T TRY MY PATIENCE -(STOP)- COME TO MEETING AT THE HOME OFFICE WITHIN 48 HOURS AND THE FINAL SPLINTER WILL BE RESTORED TO YOU -(STOP)- DELAY ANY FURTHER AND WE WILL RENEGOTIATE TERMS LESS IN YOUR FAVOR -(STOP)- BETTER TO WORK FOR ME THAN AGAINST ME MARGUERITE REMEMBER THAT -(STOP)- GOOD WORK SO FAR -(STOP)-\n\nThe last sentence sickens me—or maybe that’s pregnancy nausea again. I don’t know. Maybe both.\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether I feel ready. I have to save Paul, and that means I leave tomorrow.\n\nI’d go this moment, if I didn’t feel like I should speak to Theo one more time before we face Conley again. We need to present a united front—and right this second, if I leaped out of this dimension I’m not sure Theo would follow.\n\nNo, of course he would. He’d do it for Paul.\n\nAfter I climb into bed, and only the one glass-shaded lamp beside my bed is lit, I take a deep breath. Finally I pick up the grand duchess’s sketch pad and open it. Drawn on the top page is the portrait I couldn’t look at before: Lieutenant Markov. Paul. The man who made me fall in love.\n\nShe’s etched him in the softest, most precise lines. Only hinted at color. Yet she has captured something in him that blazes with life.\n\nI know the expression on his face; I even know where he’s standing, from the quality of the light. She drew this thinking of Paul leading her to the Easter Room where she could admire the Fabergé eggs. The portrait of my mother hung in the heart of a wine-colored egg he placed gently into my hands; I remember looking up from the intricate gold mechanism inside to see his face—strong, yet uncertain. Just like this. Like my Paul, too.\n\nThe next page is Lieutenant Markov again, this time standing at attention beside my door, the military uniform he wears outlining his broad shoulders and narrow waist, the scale revealing how tall and powerfully built he is.\n\nWas.\n\nOne evening last month, when Paul and I were alone at the house, I asked him to sit for me. Since I’d ripped up the first portrait I’d painted of him, I needed to paint another one—a better one, that would capture the man I now knew so much better than before.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Paul wasn’t a natural model. “I feel strange,” he said, sitting stiffly on the chair.\n\n“Just relax.” I made sure the drop cloth covered my bedroom floor, then took up my pencil to start sketching. “It’s only me. Right?”\n\n“Right.” But he stared forward as if he were facing a firing squad.\n\nLaughing, I said, “It could be worse, you know.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“In my Life Drawing class last year, we had nude models.”\n\nI expected him to be relieved that I was sketching him with his clothes on. Instead, Paul’s eyes met mine, and—very slowly—he reached for the hem of his T-shirt.\n\n“Paul—” But my voice died in my throat as he pulled his shirt off and tossed it to the floor where it fell almost at my feet.\n\nWe’d taken things so slowly after the Russiaverse, and Paul had let me take the lead every step of the way. Or he had until this moment, when he began stripping down in front of me. I’d never imagined that shy, reticent Paul would take a step so bold—or that I’d find it so incredibly exciting when he did.\n\n“You’ve already seen me naked,” he said with a shrug that wasn’t as nonchalant as it was meant to be.\n\n“No, I haven’t.” There’s been a lot of touching since we got together in January. A lot. But relatively little looking.\n\n“You’ve seen another me, then. And we’re the same, aren’t we?”\n\nI started to argue with him, then wondered why I would do something so stupid. Besides, I told myself—I’m just drawing him. That’s all.\n\nHe continued, “You’re only painting me from the chest up, like most of your portraits, right?”\n\nThat had been the original plan. But as I tucked a curl behind my ear and tried to act casual, I said, “In Life Drawing, we usually tried to, uh, capture the entire figure. The whole body.” Then, more boldly, I added, “If you dare.”\n\nPaul raised one eyebrow, rose from the chair, and unbuttoned his jeans; I stood there, pencil in hand, my cheeks flushed with heat. He let his jeans drop, but kept his boxers on—at least, for the moment.\n\nBefore this moment, I’d been smiling. No longer. Difficult to smile with your mouth hanging open. Don’t drool, I told myself. Keep it together.\n\nBut Paul’s body—he’s a big guy, and well proportioned, but it was the rock climbing that did it. All those hours scrambling up cliffs had carved muscles into his back, his abdomen, his thighs. Not in a creepy bodybuilder way—in an ohmigod freakin’ hot way. Even if he’d been some anonymous model from class, I would’ve been speechless at the sight of him all but naked, submitting to my gaze.\n\nIn Life Drawing, we sometimes asked the models for specific poses. At first it was awkward, but everybody got over the weirdness after a little while. Facing Paul that day, however, I wasn’t as cool. “Um, could you—if—um, could you sit on the corner of the chair, your back toward me?”\n\n“You get to look at me, but I don’t get to look at you?” Paul said, even as he did what I asked.\n\n“You get to look at me. Just—over your shoulder.” Slowly he glanced back toward me, gray eyes intense. When his face was at the ideal angle, I said, “There. Right there.”\n\nFor several long, silent minutes, Paul remained as still as any of the professional models. I sketched his perfect body with loving attention to every single detail: his broad shoulders, long-fingered hands, tapered waist. With my index finger, I smudged the lines slightly to create shadows and dimension; it was so easy to imagine really touching him."

        "content": "Just put everything down, take five steps, and then you can put your hands on him, ask him to put his hands on you—\n\nAs I looked into Paul’s eyes, I could see the answering echo of my own desire. He was breathing faster, unsure but willing. I hadn’t known I could want someone so much it made me dizzy.\n\nBut as I took that first step forward, I heard the front door—and Dad’s voice. “Marguerite? Are you home?”\n\nShit. I threw Paul’s T-shirt at him; he was already leaping into his jeans in a quick change worthy of Clark Kent. Through some miracle, he was fully dressed again by the time my father got around to checking my bedroom. Luckily Dad couldn’t see the sketch on my easel; I made sure to hide it afterward, too.\n\nThe grand duchess must hide her drawings of Lieutenant Markov. Even now, when her secret love for him has already been exposed, the tsar would be furious if he had to confront the evidence.\n\nIt’s brave of her to draw these, I think, flipping through a few rougher studies of Paul’s hands, his profile. Brave of her to keep them.\n\nThen I come to a drawing in an entirely different style from all the rest—far softer, the lines less certain, as if the grand duchess were trying to paint an image within a cloud. Paul again, but lying naked in bed, the sheet tossed aside, his arm outstretched toward the artist. Toward her; toward me. The memory comes back to life so vividly that I can almost feel the heat of the wood stove, hear the wind whipping outside the dacha, and taste Paul’s mouth against mine.\n\nWiping at my eyes, I set the sketch pad aside. As I do so, one more letter falls out from between the pages. When I look at the envelope, it proves to be unimportant—a staggering bill from a couturier for the gowns I’ve purchased here in Paris. Yet seeing this makes me realize this universe’s Marguerite has never received a letter from the person she needs to hear from the most.\n\nI find the fountain pen and a blank sheet of paper, and begin:\n\nTo the Grand Duchess Margarita,\n\nHow do I begin to tell you how sorry I am for what I’ve done to you? I never meant to stay so long in Russia the first time, and I promise not to stay more than another day here.\n\nI should not have spent the night with Lieutenant Markov. As much as we loved each other, his love was more for you than for me, and I never should have stolen your only chance to be together. Most of all, I should have been more careful. Causing your pregnancy is the single worst thing I’ve ever done in my life, and there’s no way for me to begin making it up to you.\n\nMaybe you don’t care how awful I feel about it. I wouldn’t blame you. But what I can promise is that, after this, I’ll never return to this dimension again. (“Dimensions” are what you seem to have called “shadow worlds.”) From now on, I swear: Your life is your own. Your body is your own.\n\nI’m glad that at least you’ve gotten to know Dad. Hopefully that helps, having someone who’s always on your side. Because he is, in my world just as much as in yours.\n\nBack home, Mom is alive and well. She’s a groundbreaking scientist, happy with Dad and with her life. I don’t have your siblings—who I miss so much—but I do have an older sister. Her name is Josephine, and I’m not sure what you’d make of her. She’s another scientist, and so tough and strong she could probably outfight most of the cavalry officers. But I bet the two of you would hit it off.\n\nAnd Paul—\n\nI hesitate, pen in hand. What can I possibly say?\n\nAnd Paul is alive too. He studies physics with Mom and Dad, which is how I met him. Although he and I were already close before I came to your dimension, this is where I realized how much I love him.\n\nWriting down the words reminds me of a hundred beautiful moments: Paul and me standing beneath the redwoods, staring up at the canopy of green leaves so impossibly far overhead. Making out in his dorm room, hearing his breath quicken as he pulls me closer. His giving me a bouquet of pink roses on Valentine’s Day, which I should’ve thought was cheesy but instead reduced me to a giddy puddle. Sketching him that evening, totally overcome by his physical presence.\n\nMaking lasagna together the night before Thanksgiving.\n\nTalking about my paintings, and how he thought they always told the truth.\n\nLearning that he’d risked everything to protect me and rescue my father.\n\nHere, now, this moment, recognizing how much of what we are is truly between him and me alone.\n\nAs much as I loved Lieutenant Markov—what I feel for Paul is even more powerful. The love for him I’d tried to bury lives again inside me.\n\nShakily, I write the final paragraphs of my letter to the Grand Duchess Margarita:\n\nYou’ve given me so much—more, even, than I took from you. I don’t only need to atone for what I’ve done to your life; I also need to thank you for some of the most beautiful days I’ve ever known.\n\nFor the greatest love I’ve ever felt, and even for giving that love back to me.\n\nI fold the letter and slip it into her sketch pad. She’ll find it when the time is right. My apologies have to be meaningless for her, but surely she’ll take some comfort from finding out she’s not one bit crazy. The shadow worlds, everything she went through in December: All of it was real. I hope knowing that helps. It’s the best I can do.\n\nI curl up in bed and turn out the light. Even with all the emotions churning within me, I’m tired enough to pass out within moments.\n\nBut then I feel something weird in my stomach. It comes and goes in an instant, the kind of thing that’s easy to forget.\n\nI feel it again, though, and this time the sensation is weirder. Honestly, it’s as though a goldfish is swimming deep inside me—\n\n—which is when I realize the truth, and my eyes open wide.\n\nThe next morning, once I’m done getting sick, I send a note down to the management, telling them to send a summons to Theodore Willem Beck. No, it won’t be easy for them to find him—but dammit, in this dimension I’m a grand duchess of all the Russias. What’s the point of being royalty if you can’t make impossible demands once in a while?\n\nMaybe not so impossible. Either the hotel had Theo’s information on file after all or the Ritz Paris is extremely dedicated to customer service, because they soon reply that they’ll have him here by noon.\n\nThat’s still a few hours away. Maybe I have time to create a portrait of my family back home, using the grand duchess’s pastels and sketchbook. She’d probably like to see what Mom would look like if she were still alive in this dimension. The pose for the family group requires some care; if anyone else ever sees this, it’s probably best if the late tsaritsa and the royal tutor aren’t in each other’s arms. So I put us on the sofa—Mom and Dad on the ends, me next to Mom, Josie by Dad.\n\nJust as I’m shading in Josie’s chin, there’s a rap on the door. That must be Theo, though I’m slightly surprised the hotel simply sent him up to the Suite Imperial. “Come in!” I call, just as I remember the notation in the appointment book, something about news from a Cousin Karin—\n\nBut my visitor is someone else entirely.\n\nDizziness washes over me again, but this time it’s only from astonishment, and maybe joy. “Vladimir?”\n\n“Marguerite!” He crosses the room and scoops me into his arms; his camel-colored overcoat is still cool from the outside air. “Oh, look at you. Are you well?”"

        "content": "“I’m better. I’m so much better, I promise.” Why did I ever think Vladimir would have abandoned his sister? Instead, he crossed most of Europe to visit me. I pull back from his embrace enough to look at him again. In some ways it’s still strange, seeing a guy’s face that reminds me so much of my mother’s, and my own. But this is Vladimir—same curly hair, same mustache, same open grin. I missed him even more than I knew.\n\n“Better?” he says, then lowers his voice. “But you are—you remain—”\n\nHis eyes flicker down toward my belly.\n\nVladimir knows. He’s known all along. Of course he still loved her; of course he’s still on her side. Why did I ever doubt him? Relief washes through me again, even more powerfully. “Yes.”\n\n“Then we stick with the plan.” Vladimir brushes my hair back from my forehead. “I’ve spoken to Karin. She will be discreet—you needn’t doubt her, she’s kept many secrets in her sixty years. Her house is in the Danish countryside, and she has only a handful of servants, all loyal to her. I’ll explain to Father that you’re still unwell, but tell him he was right about therapy being useless. When I explain that you need several months to recuperate in the country air, with family, he’ll accept it.”\n\nSeveral months. Through late September. “And after? What about after?”\n\nMaybe the other Marguerite already understands this. I have no rational reason to ask. But I have to know what will become of this child I helped create.\n\n“Karin will prove her generosity and adopt an orphan child. A new little cousin of ours, whom of course you will come to cherish during your time in Denmark. Naturally you’ll want the child to visit often. Perhaps to live with the family in Russia in a few years, when Karin becomes old enough to wish to return to Copenhagen.”\n\nA cousin. A visitor. Already I feel myself rejecting this, thinking, It’s not enough. This Marguerite has to have felt the same way; if she didn’t want this baby, desperately, she wouldn’t have asked Vladimir to find a solution.\n\nBut this is probably the best answer available in her world. The royal family pride will be preserved. The tsar will never learn of the pregnancy. And the child will live with this other me soon. The grand duchess will help to raise her, or him. They’ll love each other, and someday . . . someday maybe she can tell the truth about how the baby came into this world.\n\nTo the small person-to-be inside, I think, Your mother is going to tell you all about your dad. She’s going to tell you he was the best man we’ve ever known.\n\nVladimir cuddles me protectively. “You look so pale. Have you packed your things? Do you need someone to help you?”\n\n“I haven’t packed.” Because I had no idea I was leaving. “And there’s someone I should say goodbye to before we go. He should be here before noon.”\n\n“Very well. I’ll settle your bills. Of course you had to shop to convince the tsar you were doing well in Paris, but I must say, you made a thorough job of it.” He cups my chin in his hand, the way he must have done when I was a little girl. “Before I forget to say it, I’ve missed you terribly.”\n\n“I’ve missed you too.”\n\nBy 11:00 a.m., Vladimir has helped me pack almost everything. I make sure my note to the grand duchess is folded in the back of the sketchpad, next to the portrait of my own family, before I tuck that into her trunk. Vladimir, meanwhile, is shaking his head at my new collection of broad-brimmed hats. “Honestly, Margarita. How can you need so many?”\n\n“They’re the only clothes that will still fit me in a few months’ time,” I say, which makes him laugh.\n\nThen the concierge rings to tell me my guest is waiting for me in the garden. Vladimir gives me a look. “Your mysterious farewell?”\n\n“Yes. I’ll be right back, all right?”\n\nNaturally the Ritz has made sure its gardens are as elegant as the rest of the hotel. Even though spring is only now settling upon Paris, the wide lawn already shines a light, vivid green. White marble neoclassical statues stand on pedestals throughout the long, narrow length of the garden, and the branches of the trees around the edges are already heavy with buds that will soon become flowers. Only a few flowers have appeared so far—tulips, mostly.\n\nTheo waits for me in a corner of the garden, gray overcoat buckled rakishly tight at the waist, hat at a jaunty angle. Once he sees me, he immediately hurries to my side. “Oh, my God. Sit. You have to sit. How do you feel?”\n\n“Still capable of walking. But thanks.” Despite everything, I have to laugh.\n\nHe guides me to the nearest bench, his hands gentle on my shoulders as if I were made of spun glass. Once we’re seated, he looks into my eyes and whispers, “Holy shit.”\n\n“I know. I know!”\n\n“I can’t get over it.”\n\n“You can’t get over it?” I’m the one who’s had morning sickness.\n\n“It’s just—there’s a little Paul in there. Or a little Marguerite.” He stares at my belly like it’s a viewscreen directly into my uterus, then shakes his head, visibly pulling himself back together. “This makes me Uncle Theo. The responsibility takes some getting used to.”\n\nHe’s overdoing his reaction—trying to cheer me up, because he realizes how overwhelming this must be. And maybe he’s trying a little too hard to be happy about something that might be hard for him to hear. But I can tell his emotions are genuine, and it touches me in a way I wouldn’t have expected.\n\nI’ve never understood how anybody could be in love with two people at the same time. Your heart can only sing one song at a time.\n\nWhat I’ve learned, though, is that being in love doesn’t make everybody else in the world invisible. Someone you found attractive before? Yeah, they don’t magically turn hideous when you fall in love with another person. You don’t stop thinking their jokes are funny; you don’t stop being interested in what they have to say. You don’t stop caring about a human being just because he’s not the one you care most about in the world.\n\nIt’s not the same as being in love, of course. If anything, I’m more aware than ever before of the wide gulf between mere chemistry and actually loving someone. Even when I have these moments of profound connection with Theo, he stands on the other side of a line I have no desire to cross.\n\nAnd finally Theo has accepted that line.\n\n“I’m going to buy you your first beer,” he whispers as he leans forward, addressing my belly. “Way before you’re legal. Don’t tell your parents.”\n\n“You’re in the wrong universe for that. Here, I think you’re off the hook.”\n\n“You never know.”\n\n“Theo, it’s been so strange, the past couple of days. Every time I remembered Paul shooting you, I didn’t know what to think. But now—this—” I pat the slight swell of my stomach. “Late last night I was thinking about Paul, and the baby moved, and everything I ever felt for Paul came rushing back.”\n\n“That’s Paul’s baby,” Theo says in wonder. He’s talking to himself, not to me. “Man, I wish I could see this kid.”\n\n“Me too.” It feels so strange, knowing I’ll never once look at this child, or hold it in my arms."

        "content": "Theo’s smile is sincere, but somewhat twisted. “I was glad to get the call from the hotel this morning. After last night, I wasn’t sure you’d still be talking to me.”\n\n“Why wouldn’t I be talking to you?” How stupid. We both know why.\n\nHe says only, “Might’ve crossed a certain line there. Definitely, I have some apologies to make to Paul.”\n\n“Well, you don’t have to apologize to me. You spoke from the heart, and you have the right to tell the truth about what you feel.” Here in the gardens, beneath the bower of the trees, we are in the heart of Paris and yet somehow all alone, too. I’m grateful for the privacy. “Listen, I need to be completely clear.”\n\n“It’s still Paul,” Theo says. “For you, he’s the one. I know that.”\n\nI try to find the right words. “Last night, it was like it hit me all over again, how much I wanted to be with him. I need to work this out, but with Paul.”\n\nTheo smiles at me, cocksure as ever. Nobody would ever guess that he’d just confessed his love, then unflinchingly put it aside.\n\n“I’m not only in love with Paul because of Lieutenant Markov. That’s not even how it began, really. Just what made me admit it. What I saw in New York scared me, and I still don’t understand it, but it’s like you said. I can’t blame him for something another Paul did, just like I don’t blame you anymore for everything we went through with the other Theo.”\n\nHis lips press together tightly before he says, “You’ve promised that before.”\n\n“No, I mean it,” I say, and even though it might be the wrong moment for this, I take his hand. “I doubted you because of things the other Theo did, and I was wrong.”\n\n“The price of forgiveness is steep,” Theo says. “Because when you forgave me—you forgave Paul.”\n\nIt wasn’t quite that simple, but it’s close enough. “In some ways, I feel closer to Paul now than ever.” My hand steals over my belly again.\n\n“I should hope so.”\n\nQuietly I say, “You didn’t have to ask whose baby it was, when I told you.”\n\n“Remember how I told you Paul and I had a sex talk?”\n\nYes, I do. And I so do not want to know any more about that.\n\nMy expression must look sour, because Theo misinterprets it. “Listen, if you’re not ready, I could do what you told me to do in the first place. If I head on to the home office with our information, then we’ve fulfilled the terms of Conley’s agreement. He’d have to tell me where Paul is, hand over my potential cure, all of it.”\n\n“Conley wants me there.” I take a deep breath. “I’m ready to move on.”\n\nTheo reaches under the collar of his shirt and withdraws the chain of the spare Firebird, which has been around his neck since New York. I duck my head, and he places it around my neck—a silent, almost solemn transfer of responsibility.\n\nI whisper, “Theo—thanks.”\n\n“For what? Following you around the multiverse? Just part of the service.”\n\nIt feels like I have so many things to thank Theo for; I could start listing them and never stop. So I stick to the most important one: “For believing in Paul.”\n\n“Hey, this works for me too, you know. Like I said, if you forgave him for blowing my legs away, you’ve forgiven me for attacking you in a submarine that time.”\n\nWhich is true. Finally I can let it all go.\n\n“Happy endings almost all the way around,” Theo says. One of his hands lets go of mine, to reach for his Firebird. “Are we out of here?”\n\n“You go on ahead. I want to see Vladimir one last time.”\n\nTheo shakes his head, probably at my fondness for a brother I didn’t know about before December. “Okay. Just catch up with me PDQ, okay?” He smiles—slow and almost sneaky. “So, we’re headed back to the home office, the Triadverse, the same dimension that sent that other Theo here to spy on you guys.”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“He stole my body for months, and now I get the chance to steal his. If I have the chance, that son of a bitch is going to get the ugliest haircut of his life.” I burst out laughing. Theo grins wickedly as he continues, “I’m serious. If anyone in the entire multiverse deserves a reverse Mohawk, he does.”\n\n“Do your worst.”\n\nAs I rise to my feet, he takes my hand. For one moment, I remember everything he told me last night, and how much we are to each other in so many worlds I don’t yet know. “Do you really think this Theo might find this Marguerite again?”\n\n“Maybe.”\n\nI find myself hoping he will.\n\nWithin half an hour, I’m in the car with Vladimir, leaning my head against his shoulder as we head to the train station. I need to go—I’m ready to go—but it’s hard leaving my brother for good.\n\n“Do you blame me?” I murmur. “For loving Lieutenant Markov?”\n\n“Sometimes our hearts are wilder than we know.”\n\n“But you fell in love with the ideal girl. A Polish princess, no less.”\n\nVladimir’s grin can be nearly as rakish as Theo’s, sometimes. “I’d love Natalia if she were a chambermaid. When you meet her, you’ll see.”\n\n“Can’t wait. Thanks, by the way. For everything.”\n\n“That’s what family is for.”\n\nGoodbye, Vladimir, I think. In my mind I imagine them all: Peter, Katya, this world’s version of my father. And the baby, too, whose face I’ll never see. Goodbye.\n\nTime to stop looking back. Time to leap forward. Time to rescue Paul.\n\n23\n\nMY HAND CLOSES AROUND THE FIREBIRD, PRESET TO THE coordinates Wyatt Conley gave us for the home office, and—\n\n—I slam into myself, rocking backward into a broad, thinly padded chair. After the initial dizzy rush of traveling through dimensions, I immediately realize three things. One, the way I’m sitting in this chair, arms and legs braced.\n\nMy other self was prepared for this. Waiting.\n\nTwo, Theo is nowhere to be seen.\n\nThree, I’m in some kind of office or lobby in what must be the top floors of the tallest skyscraper in the world. No, taller than anything in my world—or the Triadverse.\n\nI thought Conley was bringing us back to the home office. Instead, he’s thrown us into a dimension I’ve never seen before.\n\nWhere the hell am I?\n\nThe room I sit in could be found in any corporate headquarters, if that corporation wanted to come across as chilly and forbidding. Brushed metal tiles shine dully on the walls; the large black chair I’m in, like the rest of the furniture around me, forms sharp dark angles and sits a bit too close to the floor.\n\nBut the city stretching out before me looks nothing like any city I’ve ever seen. Nothing like any city in the world I know. This has to be the hundredth story of this building, at least—but outside are dozens of buildings nearly as tall. When I went to the Londonverse, I saw strange, futuristic skyscrapers with spires and angles in every direction. At the time I found it intimidating. Now I look out at structures that all form the same darkly mirrored rectangles across the sky, the small windows giving off only the tiniest pinpricks of light. The buildings are so tall, so tightly pressed together, that I can’t see the ground at all. Brilliantly colored company logos stretch down most of the buildings in letters that must be fifteen stories tall, and yet the black hulks of the high-rises themselves dominate the view. The sliver of sky above it all glows a pale, febrile red—cinnabar, I think, or rose madder. That must be dawn."

        "content": "My body is once again its usual bony self, my belly no longer curved. The watery sensation in my abdomen I’d begun to recognize as pregnancy has vanished. It’s not like I didn’t expect it to happen, but for a moment I can only feel that sudden absence.\n\n“I see our visitor has arrived,” says a cool female voice. As soon as I register the English accent, I recognize who it is.\n\n“Romola.” I turn to see her standing near my chair, wearing clothes that look subtly, imperceptibly off—the long-sleeved shirt and pants are made of a fabric that seems stiff, even though the cut is formfitting, and everything from her collar to her shoes is the exact same shade of midnight blue. Belatedly I realize I’m wearing something very similar, but all in black.\n\n“You recognize me?” She smiles with what appears to be real pleasure. “I’m not placed well in most of the important dimensions. I so rarely get the chance to travel.”\n\n“Where am I?”\n\n“Precisely where you ought to be. Do you need some coffee? Our Marguerite didn’t sleep a wink.”\n\nI do feel tired, actually. But I don’t want anything she’s offering me, coffee or food or anything else. It feels like a fairy tale, one of the old scary ones: If you drink or eat in the mysterious realm, you never get to go home. “I don’t understand. Conley promised me that if I did what he wanted, he’d show me to the final dimension where Paul is hidden.”\n\nOr—is this the place? Instinct tells me it isn’t.\n\n“Naturally Mr. Conley intends to fulfill his bargain. After your meeting, of course.”\n\n“The meeting was supposed to be in the home office.”\n\nRomola laughs. “Where do you think you are?”\n\nAt that moment, I see the faint green glow reflecting on the skyscraper nearest us, and I recognize it as Triad’s trademark emerald.\n\nI thought the Conley I’d been dealing with—the Theo that screwed us all over so badly—I thought their universe, the Triadverse, was the home office. But the core of the evil, the plot to dominate the multiverse: It all began here.\n\nThen I realize how stupid we’ve been not to guess that another dimension was in on it, running the whole thing. We should have known that from the beginning. Because Triad means three.\n\nRomola turns brisk. “We should get started. Sure you won’t take a coffee? No? Then I’ll take you to the conference room now.”\n\n“Wait. Where’s Theo?” Did Conley even give us the same coordinates? Maybe Theo’s already rescuing Paul. Or maybe Conley sent him off in another direction entirely, or into oblivion.\n\nShe reacts to Theo’s name in a way I wouldn’t have expected. Her lips press together in disapproval. “You needn’t trouble yourself on Theo Beck’s account.”\n\n“I’ll make that decision on my own, thanks. Where is he? Did Conley kidnap him?” Dread swirls inside me. Does Conley intend to give me back Paul only after he’s abducted and splintered Theo in turn? Will I spend the rest of my life working for Triad to protect the people I love?\n\nBut Romola shakes her head. “Mr. Beck is entirely beyond our control.”\n\nI’m not sure what that means, but I like the sound of it. I imagine him down in the stark metal city, looking up at this green-tinted building and flipping it off.\n\nAs for me, I appeared within a Marguerite who seemed to be prepared. She was waiting—willing—to let me enter her body and take her over, right here in the heart of Triad headquarters. Slowly, I say, “In this dimension, I know about all this, don’t I? About Triad’s plans.”\n\nRomola smiles at me, fond and yet condescending, like someone talking to a very small child. “You’ve worked here for a while now.”\n\nSomehow, Conley is able to force me to do his bidding in this world, too.\n\nI’ve spent all this time wondering whether the constants in the multiverse are destinies, or souls, or love. Now I realize the one constant in my infinite lives might be Conley’s inescapable control.\n\nPaul and I talked about this once—the constants in the universe. The things that change, and the things that don’t.\n\nBack in early February, we drove to Muir Woods to see the redwoods. The drive to Muir Woods always terrifies me; the only way up there is a narrow, winding road that seems to be barely hanging on to the hillside. Paul kept both hands on the wheel of my parents’ new car, eyes locked on the road while I gripped the sides of the seat like that would help. At one point I laughed shakily. “This probably isn’t as scary for you. I mean, you go rock climbing. You’re used to heights.”\n\n“Yes, but when I’m climbing, I’m in considerably closer contact with the terrain and can judge my safety accordingly. Here, we have to trust a car with which I’m relatively unfamiliar.” His eyes narrowed as we neared another curve. “Our levels of fear are probably identical.”\n\n“You really didn’t have to tell me that.”\n\nHe was silent, trying once again to figure out the rules of human conversation. “I meant—we’ll be okay.”\n\nI nodded, and tried to believe him.\n\nOf course, we were okay. We got to the top in time for lunch, ate cold sesame noodles we’d brought along, and then went wandering through the forest hand in hand. (The way his large hand almost covered mine—it made me feel safer than anything else I could imagine. More than that—treasured. Like Paul held on because he never wanted me to drift away.)\n\nStanding among the redwoods does strange and beautiful things to your brain. You’re reminded of your own insignificance in the vast universe by these mammoth trees towering overhead, their leaves so far up that they seem to form a second sky. These trees live hundreds upon hundreds of years; some of the ones growing in Muir Woods today sprouted back in the Middle Ages. They’ll still be there long after the entire civilization I know has changed into something I wouldn’t recognize. Yet you don’t feel meaningless. Instead, you remember that you’re part of these trees’ history—part of the whole story of this world—connected in ways you can’t even guess.\n\n“Is that what you see?” Paul said to me after I explained this. We walked up to one of the tallest trees; I let go of his hand to press my palms against the reddish bark. “The trees as a . . . bridge to infinity?”\n\n“Yeah.” I ducked my head. “Maybe it’s the artist in me.”\n\n“You see more than I do. It’s your gift.”\n\nI smiled at him as I kept walking around the enormous circumference of the tree. “What about you? When you look at the redwoods, what do they make you think about?”\n\n“The fundamental symmetry and asymmetry of the universe.”\n\nWhen I hear something like this, from Paul or my parents or anyone else, I know not to ask any more questions unless I’m absolutely positive I want to hear the crazy-complicated answer. With Paul, I usually do. “What do you mean?”\n\nHe lifted his hand, two fingers mirroring the lines of two redwoods in the near distance. “Every one of these trees has a unique genetic code. They differ from each other in countless ways—the number of branches, the pattern in the bark, their root systems, so on. Yet they mirror each other. Parallel each other. The commonality overcomes the differences.”"

        "content": "“And that’s how the universe works?” I thought of all the different selves I’ve met, all the different paths that have led me to Paul. “We mirror each other over and over again?”\n\nHe nodded. “Down to the subatomic level. Quarks come in pairs—always—and if you try to destroy one, another will instantly appear to take its place and maintain balance.”\n\nQuarks are smaller than atoms. Smaller than electrons. I swear, that is all you ever have to know about quarks. But when Paul said it like that, the subject caught my interest. “Like, the universe knows the mirrored pairs have to exist?”\n\n“Yes, exactly.”\n\nOne thing I’ve learned from my parents is that the physical universe seems to understand a lot, in ways you’d think would require consciousness. Information between particles appears to travel faster than light. I knew better than to ask Paul about it, though, because that’s a mystery not even he can solve. I like that it’s a mystery—that the universe always knows something we won’t.\n\n“So symmetry is one of the fundamental forces of the universe.” I kept pacing around the tree. Paul, standing in place, vanished behind the trunk as I wound my way to the other side. “Unbreakable.”\n\n“No. Not unbreakable.”\n\n“But you just said—”\n\n“Physics sometimes violates its own rules.” From the pitch of Paul’s voice, I could tell he was looking upward at the branches swaying in the wind. “Luckily for us. Or else the world wouldn’t be here.”\n\n“Okay, you have to explain that one.”\n\n“One of the symmetries in the universe should be between matter and antimatter,” he says. “But you know what happens when they meet.”\n\nThis much I understand. “They annihilate each other.”\n\n“So if the universe contained exactly equal amounts of matter and antimatter, it would self-destruct. Actually, it would have self-destructed almost immediately after forming. At some point at the very beginning of creation, the symmetry broke. Nobody knows how or why. That break allowed our universe to come into being.”\n\nI came around the curve of the tree and peeked over to see Paul. His hands were jammed in the pockets of his waterproof jacket; his thrift-store jeans showed wear that had nothing to do with being “distressed.” The vivid dark greens of the forest outlined his strong profile, and his gray eyes remained focused—not on the leaves, I realized, but the one patch of blue he could see through them.\n\nI don’t know why that moment was so special, but it was. That image is one of the first I remember every time I think of how I feel about him. It was like I loved him so much in that instant, like he was part of my blood and my bones.\n\n“So that’s why the whole world is here. Asymmetry saved us,” I said as I walked back toward him. “But symmetry keeps the universe moving forward.”\n\n“More or less.” Paul turned toward me and smiled, holding out one hand.\n\nInstead of taking it, I pulled his arm around me so I could snuggle against his side. “So it’s symmetry that keeps bringing the same people together in world after world? That makes sure you and I always find each other?\n\n“Maybe,” he said. His expression clouded over. At the time I thought he was lost in thought about subatomic particles or the seconds following the Big Bang. Now I wonder whether he was thinking about the fact that the universe always seems to make sure we run into Conley, too.\n\nRomola and I ride downward in an oddly cube-shaped elevator. Long narrow screens halve each wall, and each one flashes the exact same Triad Corporation motto I know from two other worlds: Everyplace. Everytime. Everyone.\n\nAt home, the motto is in an attractive serif font that’s supposed to look quirky and creative. Here, it’s in block letters you’d see on signs in a prison. In this dimension—the Home Office—nobody’s even pretending this is about reaching out and providing fun new products for people to love. The motto’s real meaning shows through. It’s about control.\n\n“Why isn’t Conley’s office on the top floor?” Most CEOs get the prime real estate for themselves—at least, in my extensive experience of watching TV shows where corporate titans always seem to have a spectacular view.\n\nRomola gives me a look. “Not very secure, is it? The principals of Triad Corporation work from the very center of the building, of course.”\n\n“What do you mean, secure?”\n\n“Market-share rivals could launch an assault at any time. Of course we use the upper rooms—the better to keep an eye on the competition—but that’s no place for vital officers of the company.”\n\nOther companies might attack? “If—if some other company tried that—I mean, they’d go to jail, right?”\n\n“I forget.” Romola makes a tsk-tsk sound. “Your dimension still maintains the illusion of nation-states as the prime political and economic entities. In this world, we’ve outgrown such notions. Corporate allegiance is a very serious matter for consumers, who should not switch sides lightly.”\n\nI can’t even wrap my head around that. Hopefully I won’t be here long enough to have to worry about it.\n\nWhen the doors slide open, Romola leads me down a long corridor and through a series of reception rooms—all deserted, at this early hour of the day. (I left Paris around lunchtime; if it’s sunrise here, then this must be the East Coast of the United States.) Each room looks sleeker and more forbidding than the last. These are the barriers visitors have to cross if they want to see the big man himself.\n\n“You must have been looking forward to this,” Romola says. “Finally getting to the root of it all.”\n\nI laugh once, a bitter sound. “Before five minutes ago, I had no idea this dimension was even involved. I should’ve known, though. Triad means three. Three dimensions are in on it.” We all thought Triad was just a name, any other cool-sounding noun chosen at random by a bunch of twenty-something tech entrepreneurs. Why didn’t we ever question whether it meant something more?\n\nRomola gives me an odd look. “The name of the company has nothing to do with the dimensions. How could it? This branch of Triad has existed for years longer than any of the others.”\n\n“Then the name actually doesn’t mean anything?”\n\n“It does. Triad stands for the three founders of the company. The geniuses behind it all.”\n\nWith that, she presses a panel and the final doors slide open, revealing a spacious but windowless office. Behind the long, narrow desk is Wyatt Conley, his hair longer and tied back in a sort of tail; he nods by way of greeting. Sitting on either side of him are the two other founders of Triad—the two other masterminds of this conspiracy.\n\nMy parents.\n\n24\n\n“HELLO, MARGUERITE,” MY MOTHER SAYS. “YOU MUST HAVE many questions.”\n\nThousands. But I can’t ask them. I have no voice. My body reels, and I need to sit down before I fall. The room contains only three chairs, however, and all three are occupied.\n\n“Sweetheart?” My father gets to his feet—concerned and gentle and so like Dad that it makes everything even worse. “You don’t look well. I told your other self to take it easy earlier; we didn’t know when you’d get here. Of course she stayed awake the entire time, didn’t she, Miss Harrington?”"

A kitten, maybe. “As if anyone could stop Marguerite from doing what she’s set her mind to.”\n\n“Stop talking about her.” Those are the first words I can force out. “You’re dealing with me now. Talk to me.”\n\n“She’s right,” Dad says, stepping aside to make room for me. He’s wearing the same sort of stiff-yet-formfitting clothes as Romola and I are, but in a deep oaky brown. “Come on, sit down.”\n\nNumbly I walk toward his chair. As I sink into the seat, Conley motions to Romola. “Get Marguerite some water. Maybe a cup of tea. I think she could use it.”\n\nIf Wyatt Conley thinks I’m going to thank him for that, he’s living in a dream world. I look past him, directly at my mother, who sits calmly with her hands folded across the desk. To her I say, “Romola told me you were the founders of Triad Corporation. All three of you, together.”\n\nMom smiles. “Yes, that’s true.”\n\n“That’s impossible.” My voice breaks, so I make fists beneath the table, digging my nails into the heels of my hands until it hurts. I’d rather claw myself bloody than let Conley see me cry. “You wouldn’t. You and Dad would never—you wouldn’t want to make a ton of money or rule over the multiverse. That’s not who you are.” They wear the same sweaters until the wool unravels; Mom wouldn’t know “this year’s handbag” if someone hit her with it. It’s not that they’re stingy, and we’re not poor—my parents just don’t care about things very much.\n\nThey all exchange glances, before Mom replies, “Money matters more here, I’m afraid. In your world, and so many others—they pretend other elements of existence are more important. Here, we’re more honest. Everyone needs to prove their value to their sponsor or employer. Unwillingness to maximize profit is often considered a moral failing.”\n\n“Not by us,” Dad chimes in. “We recognize the shades of gray involved. But Triad employs tens of thousands of people. Their welfare is in our hands. Their futures, too. We wouldn’t want to let these people down.”\n\nMy initial reaction is to snap at them: Oh, so you’ll betray me, not to mention yourselves, just so Triad’s office workers get a slightly higher Christmas bonus. I guess that makes it okay to ruin people’s lives. However, Romola’s words of warning echo inside my mind—there’s no such thing as a nation here. Only corporations. Your fate rises or falls with your employer.\n\nIt’s an incredibly messed-up way to live, but at least I see how my parents could’ve gotten involved.\n\nDad pats my shoulder. “Triad isn’t only about profit. That’s simply the only part you’ve had a chance to see. I told you we should have called her here before.”\n\nThat was directed at Conley, who nods. His clothes are all in a dark emerald color, the shade associated with Triad and its logo. “I understand why you’re upset with me, Marguerite. My other selves can be . . .” He searches for the right words, then finishes, “total assholes.”\n\nI can’t help it; I laugh.\n\nConley smiles, overly encouraged. “I apologize for the way they’ve been acting. Their worlds don’t even have the same demands for money. For them, it’s nothing more than a power trip. And I’ll be the first to admit their methods leave much to be desired. We began this collaboration assuming that we would all benefit, but I’m the first to admit that it’s turned—exploitive.”\n\n“Why do you work with them, if you think they’re so awful? Why did you even start this—this conspiracy?” Collaboration, my ass. I push my chair back from the table, farther from Conley, and look past him to my mother. “Why didn’t you stop when the other Conleys started kidnapping people?”\n\n“Oh, darling.” Mom’s eyes fill with tears. “You have to understand. Your father and I—all three of us—by now we’re doing this for the same reason.”\n\nDad quietly adds, “We’re doing this because this is the only way we’ll ever get Josie back.”\n\nThe curving, blank walls of this room turn out to double as enormous viewscreens. On each one, a different video of Josie plays.\n\nOn the left: A family video from when Josie and I were younger, one with all of us sightseeing in some kind of glass-domed hovership. Dad’s holding the camera. He goes back and forth from focusing on the seashore below to pointing the lens at each of us in turn. Everyone dresses in monochrome, all pink or all yellow. I’m wearing my hair back in a ponytail—as unflattering here as it is at home—and wearing gray. Onscreen I try to ignore Dad’s filming while I take my own pictures, maybe to use as sources for artwork later. Mom keeps talking about how coastal irregularities always mirror fractal patterns. Josie just turns her face toward the sunshine, soaking it in.\n\nOn the right, Josie and Conley are at some kind of fancy party. To me his clothes don’t look that different from what he’s wearing now, but Josie’s wearing a long, melon-colored sheath dress, which wouldn’t look out of place back in my own world; the fact that she’s not wearing jeans would be enough to prove this is a very special occasion. Candlelight flickers from tapers mounted on the wall. Josie’s chestnut hair is pulled back on one side with some sort of tropical flower pinned at her temple; it ought to look ridiculous, but it doesn’t. Instead, she reminds me of some 1940s movie goddess—sultry and luminous. Conley’s arm is linked with hers, and he gazes at her like she’s the brightest light in the room.\n\nThe broadest screen, the one behind us, plays a video with the Triad Corporation watermark on the lower right-hand side. The brilliant aquamarine color of Josie’s formfitting outfit reminds me of one of the wetsuits she wears to go surfing. Around her neck hangs a slightly different version of the Firebird. She’s sitting at a desk, talking with her hands; I realize this is a post-mission debriefing. Josie sounds efficient, but enthusiastic. “Apparently Greco-Roman paganism had survived in dimension 101347. Temples to Zeus, Apollo, Athena, and Aphrodite were located on most major streets, but I also saw worship of other cultures’ deities, such as Odin and Isis. Various forms of paganism must have coalesced over time as . . .”\n\nI can’t take it all in. Overshadowing all these videos, all this information, is the cold truth my parents have told me: in this dimension, my sister is dead.\n\n“She volunteered,” Dad says, in a way that makes me think he must repeat this to himself very often. “Josie wanted to travel through the dimensions. Her sense of adventure . . . nothing was ever entirely enough. Always, she wanted more.”\n\nConley keeps staring at Josie’s face on the screen. “So when she offered to be our first traveler—to be this dimension’s perfect traveler—it seemed so natural to say yes. Who could do it better? Who would love it more?”\n\nNobody, I realize. Josie has always looked a little wistful when we talked about our travels in different worlds. At home, though, she’s on her own scientific adventure, immersed in oceanography—pun intended, since it makes her and Dad laugh every time. She never volunteered to be a part of our parents’ work. In this world, however, she followed in their footsteps."

        "content": "Until—\n\n“If it had happened in one of the more dangerous dimensions, I think we might have been better prepared for negative outcomes.” My mother’s voice sounds thin. Strained. “But Josie was in a world similar to yours. Technology was more primitive, but she enjoyed the easier pace of life. The access to forests, and the sea. So she kept returning—supposedly to test the effects of repeated reentries into a dimension. Really she went just because she liked it.”\n\nConley closes his eyes. “I let her. I encouraged her. It seemed harmless. She did so much work for us. Why not let her have her fun? I—I never could deny her anything she really wanted.”\n\nNobody offers the next part, so I have to ask. “What happened to Josie?”\n\nNone of them wants to be the one to say it. Dad breaks down first. “A random accident turned—horrific.”\n\nWhen it seems like Dad can’t go on, my mother speaks up. “No doubt you’ve wondered what happens if a traveler is within another self at the time of that self’s death.”\n\nI’ve definitely had reason to worry. The thought of Josie dying like that—it’s terrible, but I’ve faced dimensions without her. Dimensions where either or both of my parents are dead; dimensions where all of them died while I was still a child. It never stops hurting, but I’ve learned how to endure that. I think of my own family back home and remind myself, I’ll be with them soon.\n\nFor these versions of Mom and Dad—and Wyatt Conley, weird as that is—there’s no such comfort. “That’s how Josie died?” I speak as gently as possible. “An accident where she didn’t have time to leap out again?”\n\nMy mother shakes her head. “In some ways, yes. But the truth was so much worse.”\n\nRealization strikes. “She splintered, didn’t she?”\n\nConley answers me. “Josie attempted to leap out at the very moment of death. She didn’t quite make it. Pieces of her mind traveled to at least a hundred dimensions she’d visited earlier, as if . . .” He struggles for the right words. “As if the Firebird was trying to find a safe place for her but couldn’t. She probably made an error with the controls—she had no time, and she would have been so afraid—”\n\nBy now Dad is sitting, his head in his hands. Conley breathes shallow and fast through his nose, the way guys do when they’re trying not to cry.\n\nThis seems like a problem with an obvious solution. “Can’t you just put her back together again, using the Firebirds? The way I’m putting together my Paul?”\n\n“No,” Mom says. “We tried. We knew the splinters were too small—that we’d never find them all, and they’d be too difficult to extract from the other Josephines—but we tried anyway.”\n\nMy parents have always dreamed big. But they don’t attempt the impossible; instead, they stretch the limits of the possible. For them to keep trying when they had no chance of success? That was desperation. Or maybe it was the insanity that sometimes follows deep grief, the same madness that made me chase Paul across the dimensions when I thought he was to blame for my father’s death. Thinking of how I felt then—how shaken, how raw—cracks open something inside me.\n\nThese sad, deluded people are what’s left of my parents in this dimension. As angry as I am about everything Triad has done, I can’t help feeling sorry for them, even for this version of Conley, a little.\n\nI remember what it’s like to hurt that much. I also remember that it fades. Grief never dies—I still have nightmares about the night a cop came to our house and told us Dad had been killed, even though he turned out to be fine. But grief changes. It softens, adapts its shape to become a part of you. That kind of sorrow never gets any lighter, but you grow accustomed to the weight as you carry it on.\n\nIn time, maybe, this world’s Mom, Dad, and Wyatt Conley might snap out of it. They could realize how crazy this has become.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I say. For some reason, that seems to hurt Dad even more; he actually flinches. “I know it’s hard. I do. When I thought my dad was dead, seeing him in other dimensions . . . it helped me, for a while. If you need to keep visiting Josie—different versions of her—that’s okay. But that doesn’t mean you let the other two Conleys do whatever they want. I mean, they splintered Paul on purpose! Think about what they’re doing, would you? Splintering Paul and holding each piece of his soul hostage, letting Theo get sick from the Nightthief—even kidnapping another version of you, Dad—that’s so far over the line that nothing could ever make it right.”\n\nThey all exchange glances, and Conley sighs heavily. “Things are at the point where we intend to step in. Within a few weeks, the other two of me shouldn’t be a problem for you anymore.”\n\nThat ought to be a huge relief. Why does it make me tense instead?\n\nMaybe it’s because they’ve done a lot of explaining, without giving me the answers I need most. Time to make my demands. “I want what I was promised. I want the coordinates to find Paul, and I want the cure for Nightthief.”\n\nI expect evasion, or some kind of further bargain. Instead, Conley smiles as if in pride, and my mom and dad give each other the look that means they forgot something again. (The phrase “absentminded professor” exists for a reason.) Conley’s hand moves across the tabletop—which I realize now is also a sort of touchscreen—and after a moment, both of the Firebirds against my chest buzz slightly, receiving new data.\n\n“There you go,” my father says. “You’re programmed with your next coordinates, plus we sent you a data file with information about the Nightthief treatment. The minute you move on, you can collect Paul, head on to your home dimension, and see if you can’t put Theo right. It is Theo who’s suffering the adverse effects, isn’t it?”\n\nHe acts so kind yet is so totally oblivious to the consequences of his actions. “Yes. It’s Theo.”\n\n“The formula for the solution you’ve been given isn’t a cure,” Mom explains. It takes me a second to realize she means solution in the chemistry sense. “However, it greatly diminishes the toxicity within the body, and gives the patient’s immune system a chance to heal itself.”\n\n“Yes,” I say dully. “I know.” All this, and the best I can give Theo is a chance. I think of his face at the Moulin Rouge, the naked vulnerability I saw there, and my throat tightens.\n\nMy mother comes to me and puts her arms around my shoulders. “You’re tired. Come home with us for a while. Rest. Learn a little more about our world.”\n\nThe tightness around my chest loosens slightly. Something about this still feels wrong to me, but I know I’d rather deal with my parents than any version of Wyatt Conley, anywhere. “Okay. That sounds good.” I toss off the next in an effort to sound casual. “Just us?”\n\nConley laughs. “Don’t worry; I’m not coming with you. I don’t blame you for mistrusting me, Marguerite. In fact, I’d say it’s proof of your intelligence.”\n\nI get to my feet, and my parents begin leading me out. Dad’s hand touches my shoulder, maybe seeking comfort from the one daughter he has left. But I can’t bring myself to walk away from this room just yet."

        "content": "To Conley I say, “You’re in love with Josie in New York too. The New York I just visited. If the other Conley had that kind of access, why didn’t he go to that dimension and sabotage the Firebird project himself?”\n\n“I told him not to.” His voice is sharp. “Any dimension where Josie and I have a chance at a happy life—they’re not allowed to interfere with that. Not ever. And I’ve already warned them away from Josie in either of the other two dimensions of Triad.” His eyes search mine, and for once I see no hint of his usual arrogance. In this moment, he aches for Josie as much as I do. “Neither of them deserve her, do they?”\n\nFor once, Wyatt Conley and I agree.\n\nMy parents and I travel to their home via monorail. The monorails I’m used to, though, are slow-moving, sedate things meant to shuttle people between airport terminals or around a theme park. This one is sleek, and it moves at terrifying speed.\n\nAs I peer out the window, I see a tangle of buildings below us—skyscrapers on skyscrapers—but not one patch of ground. “Do I want to know how high up we are?”\n\n“Probably not,” Dad says, smiling, with only a shadow of his usual good cheer.\n\nDawn came less than an hour ago, which means only a few other passengers board the monorail car. They, too, stick to monochrome outfits, though now I begin to notice small details of cut and shading—which seem to correspond to the brand names stitched into the collars or cuffs, in thread almost the same shade as the clothes themselves. And the interior of the monorail car is all in tan, without even a single poster trying to sell soda or shoes or anything else.\n\n“Where are all the ads?” I ask.\n\nOne of the other riders shoots me a look like I just said something obscene. Mom whispers, “Public transit was declared neutral territory in the last treaty.”\n\nOkay, then.\n\nAs the monorail snakes higher and the daylight brightens, the forbidding shadows of this world fade, revealing the sparkle of metal and glass. The tall buildings and skybridges now reflect silver or bronze, and I can see how this place might almost be pretty, if you lived and worked up this high.\n\nLower down, closer to the ground? I wonder if those people ever even glimpse the sun.\n\nThe relatively still skies around us suddenly burst into life; a thousand small silvery flying vehicles take to the sky, almost simultaneously. I think of blowing away a dandelion’s fuzz with one hard puff. Dad notices my reaction. “Individual transport is restricted to certain times of day.”\n\nDoes that mean Theo might now be on the move?\n\nOnce again, I take my Firebird in hand to search for Theo. This time, I get a more conclusive answer; he’s not far from here, just a whole lot farther down. No doubt he’s getting a very different perspective on this dimension. We ought to compare notes.\n\n“Can we go get Theo?” I ask. When my parents stare at me blankly, I wonder whether they’ve met him in this universe, though they should be aware of him from everything else that’s already happened. I’m pretty sure he asked about Theo. Even Romola knew him, after all. Just in case, I specify: “Theo Beck? The one traveling with me? And—I don’t know if you guys work with Paul here or not—”\n\n“We don’t,” Dad says. That would be a relief, if not for the short, clipped way he says it.\n\nMy father only talks like that when he’s angry.\n\nMom leans closer to me and says slowly and firmly, “Paul Markov and Theo Beck have no role in the current Firebird project. You can coordinate with them as you move forward through the dimensions. It’s unnecessary here. Do you understand?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nI understand more than they meant for me to.\n\nMy parents wouldn’t act that way if they simply didn’t know Paul and Theo in this world. Mom wouldn’t specify the current Firebird project. All of them worked together here, until Paul and Theo turned against them. Exactly why or how, I don’t know. If this world’s versions of Theo and Paul are as screwed-up as my parents, they could have left Triad for the wrong reasons. Very wrong reasons.\n\nAlready I know I have to find Paul and Theo, no matter what my mother and father say. But when I do—will I be able to trust them?\n\nIn this dimension, I might be on my own.\n\n25\n\nTHE MONORAIL RISES HIGHER AND HIGHER. I’VE NEVER been overly phobic about heights, but when we begin zooming over the tops of skyscrapers, my gut starts to churn with dread.\n\nThen again, that might not have anything to do with heights.\n\nMy parents sit on either side of me, both of them comfortable and seemingly content. I don’t doubt their love—both for their daughter from this dimension and even for me. Yet with every passing second, their cold words about Paul and Theo echo louder in my memory.\n\nPaul and I aren’t the only ones destined to meet; the countless symmetries of the multiverse touch everyone, in different ways. I seem to find Theo nearly as often as I find Paul. Josie and Wyatt Conley often come together too—even though I wish they didn’t.\n\nAnd the mysterious currents of fate and mathematics bring Paul and Theo to my parents.\n\nThey invent together. Create together. The technologies they develop shape the multiverse itself. I’ve seen it in countless dimensions. Even in the Warverse, where my parents were awkward with Paul because of me, they still worked with him and understood the brilliance of his mind.\n\nIn this universe, Mom and Dad claim Paul and Theo don’t matter.\n\nWhy are they lying to me?\n\nI steal a glance at my father, who smiles at me with his usual gentleness. They don’t intend to hurt me; I feel sure of that. But they also didn’t mean to hurt me when they founded Triad, when they collaborated with the Wyatt Conleys, when they allowed Paul to be kidnapped and Theo to be poisoned. Their intentions may be good, but their judgment isn’t.\n\nAgainst my chest, the weight of the Firebird reminds me that I have the information I came for. I want to learn more about this universe, and what the founders of Triad intend to do next; for once, I’d like our dimension not to be the one kept in the dark. Hearing someone else’s perspective would be good.\n\nAnd if that perspective came from Paul, or Theo, I have a feeling I’d learn a whole lot more.\n\nThe monorail slips into misty shadow, reminding me of morning fog on San Francisco Bay. Only then do I realize we’ve glided into a cloud. We are too far up. When we begin to slow down, for a moment I think the driver agrees with me—but then we arrive at another station. My parents stand; this must be our stop.\n\n“We live this high off the ground?” I’m grateful for the cloud, because at least I can no longer see exactly how far we’d have to fall.\n\nMom shakes her head, which is a relief until she says, “We take the lift up from here.”\n\nI hope our house doesn’t have windows.\n\nBy now, only a handful of people remain on the monorail, and most of those disembark at our station. The majority of the crowd heads right, while we go left. I glance at my father, confused, and he explains, “Most people take the lift down. They like to get off at the highest station they can still reach their homes from. It’s the only way people can broadcast their status, in public transit space.”\n\n“I thought it was safer in the middle of the buildings,” I say, recalling Romola’s shock at the idea of an executive office on the top floor."

        "content": "“For corporate headquarters, of course,” Mom says. She sounds incredulous, as if she were having to explain why ovens aren’t installed in bedrooms. “But the Intercorporate Conventions provide for severe sanctions if employees are targeted at home.”\n\nThis dimension puts the whole Coke-versus-Pepsi thing into perspective.\n\nHere, the station gleams an almost pearly white; someone must polish this floor pretty much every hour. But the relative swank factor of subway stations isn’t important. What hits me now is that if I want to see the part of this dimension Triad will never show me—to find Paul and Theo—this is my last chance to vanish into the crowd.\n\nTo our far right, I glimpse two signs that read TOILETS—one in blue, one in pink. This is as good a chance as I’ll get. “Hey, I should—”\n\nMy mother waves me off as my father smiles. They’re so unsuspecting that I feel a little guilty. But as I walk toward the pink sign, I hear Mom call, “Marguerite? Where are you going?”\n\nOh, crap. I half turned and tried to smile. “The little girls’ room?”\n\nShe points toward the blue sign. “Isn’t blue for girls in your world?”\n\nHere, pink is for boys. It’s the little things that get you. “Oh, okay. Thanks.”\n\nI walk away from them, not too fast. My path intersects with the crowd headed toward the down elevators, and I have to angle my shoulders, step carefully, to keep from bumping into anyone. That gives me a perfectly natural reason to glance backward, and I see my parents talking intently to each other.\n\nI shift direction to merge into the crowd. I walk as quickly as I can without drawing attention to myself, because I won’t be in the clear until I get on one of those elevators. Will I be safe even then? Can my parents track the Firebirds around my neck? Probably, but I have to chance it.\n\nOnce I think I’m out of sight, I push forward, earning myself a few glares. But nobody says anything as I edge into an overstuffed elevator just in time for the doors to slide shut only two inches in front of my face.\n\nMy heart pounds. My ears tighten and pop with the pressure of descent. At any moment I expect the lights to turn red—or maybe Triad green—and start broadcasting some kind of futuristic APB. But it doesn’t happen. Stop after stop, we keep going down. I decide to get off at the very last stop, wherever that might be. The farther I get away from Triad’s space, the better.\n\nFinally, when I’m one of only three people left inside, the elevator settles with a thump that I know means the end. I walk through the doors, out of the smaller, danker station—and into chaos.\n\nElectronic billboards and signs cover every single surface, all of them shining in colors so strident it almost hurts to look at them. They clash with each other, as do the tinny recordings playing from speakers as ubiquitous as they are invisible:\n\nApollo Greek Yogurt! Up to 50 percent real dairy!\n\nExplore Your World: Viking Supersonic Air Cruises.\n\nSentinel upgrades 10 percent off this week only! Isn’t your family’s safety worth it?\n\nRevlon EverLash—Wear Him Out!\n\nOverwhelmed, I tilt my head down, but that doesn’t help; the floor is thickly papered with adhesive posters for shoes, flying cars, movies. (Leonardo DiCaprio again.) Above is no better—it’s the same posters, just less dingy from footprints.\n\nAt first I can’t decide whether this is a mall or a street, but then I realize that, in this world, there seems to be no difference. Some stretches are open to the outside, but the stores and the pathways seem to meld into each other. Walking more than five steps without seeing a new product display is impossible.\n\nI think of the trip our family took to Las Vegas for Josie’s high school graduation; it was supposed to be kitschy and hilarious, but instead, we all hated it. I’d envisioned a casino as . . . well, a casino. A distinct building, a place you would enter. Instead, the minute we got off the airplane—still in the airport terminal!—we were bombarded with slot machines. You couldn’t check into the hotel without being surrounded by gift shops and restaurants. Couldn’t get to the elevator after check-in without walking past roulette tables. Vegas was just one big outstretched hand, waiting for your money. That’s what this entire dimension has become.\n\nWhen I’ve got my bearings, I tuck myself into a corner between two rotating cases of refrigerated, brand-name sandwiches. Then I take up the Firebird and check again for Theo.\n\nThe signal suggests he’s right where I am—almost exactly—and I feel a burst of hope before I realize he’s lower than me.\n\nLots lower.\n\nWith a sigh, I fight my way back through the crowd to the next series of down elevators—and the layer under that—and the layer under that. Each time I switch, the ads become more garish; the products they advertise seem cheaper. And the light through the mesh screens dims further at every stop.\n\nWhen I finally go to what must be the final elevator, someone says, “Young lady.” I turn to see a guy in a vivid pink uniform, which I guess looks super-butch here. “Are you sure you want to do that?”\n\nWhat, get on the elevator? “Uh, yeah.”\n\n“Below is no place for anyone your age.” The way he says it, I know Below is their name for whatever awaits.\n\n“I’ll be okay,” I say, and I get on the elevator alone. Through the narrowing gap of the closing doors, I see him frown and shake his head.\n\nWhen the elevator doors open again, only a handful of electronic billboards are here, and they glow dimly, as their images play without sound. The floor is just a floor, and the platforms are open to the air.\n\nOutside, it’s as dark as night.\n\nI walk to the railing and look down; by now, I’m only twenty-five or thirty feet from the ground. Cracked asphalt—more like rubble—is all that remains of what were once sidewalks, or streets. Nobody walks down there. A few people hurry along these almost-deserted walkways beside me, but none of them appear happy to be there. They give me appraising glances; clearly my black clothing sets me apart from the shabbier taupe-and-tan material I see down here. I wonder if I’m about to get mugged. My hand closes around my Firebirds, protectively.\n\nThen I hear the thumping of footsteps—many of them—and hear someone say: “If I’m reading this correctly, she’s just around the corner.”\n\nIt’s Theo. I begin to smile as I walk forward to meet them. “Thank God you’re—”\n\nMy words trail off. Just from the way he looks at me, hard and flat—I can tell this isn’t my Theo. The one who came here with me is asleep within this world’s version, who doesn’t seem to know me at all. Is this Theo simply tracking an intruder from another dimension?\n\nHis whole group goes still. So do I. Because Theo just pulled something black and angular that I’m pretty damn sure is a weapon.\n\nAnd he’s pointing it at me.\n\nTheo grins. “Not as much fun this time, is it?”\n\nNot one person intercedes on my behalf. The few others walking along this stretch of road determinedly look away, not wanting to get involved. There are no pink-suited cops anywhere near.\n\nI should probably be even more scared than I am, but my brain keeps repeating one phrase over and over.\n\nThis time?\n\n“We’ve got her!” Theo calls. He wears his hair longer here, but it sticks up and out rather than growing down; he looks a little like a punk Beethoven. His clothes are baggier and more layered than the stuff worn above, but again it’s all the same color—in this case, a dark burnt orange. “Come on, man, you have to see this!”"

        "content": "Even before the figure far behind him steps into the light, I know it’s Paul.\n\nHe wears a gray so pale it almost seems white. Unlike most of the men in this dimension, Paul keeps his hair short—even shorter than at home. His long coat hangs past his knees; his boots are the first shoes I’ve seen in this dimension that look like they’ve touched the ground.\n\nPaul gives Theo a look. “Is the gun really necessary?”\n\n“How can you even ask that?” But when Paul gestures, Theo hmmphs and puts the weapon away.\n\n“Thank you,” I say.\n\nPaul acknowledges this with only a nod. “We need to talk. Obviously you understand that, or you would never have come Below.”\n\n“Yeah, we do.” I glance upward, imagining I’d be able to glimpse some pale sliver of the sky—but nothing. Down here the world is black on black. “Can my parents trace me through the Firebird? Could Conley?”\n\n“It would take awhile for them to manage it, this far down,” Paul says, with approval for my caution. “Come on. We’ll talk.”\n\nTheo looks at the two of us, almost comically angry, but he makes no move to stop us, or oppose Paul. The other members of their gang—four women, three men—don’t seem much happier than Theo, but none of them protest.\n\nThey lead me down the final set of steps. When I first set foot on the ground, it feels momentous. Forbidden. Maybe it is. But Paul’s gang is used to it, quickly taking me along the crumbling, uneven path to the base of one of the huge monolithic skyscrapers. Apparently whatever corporation is housed there doesn’t use their lower floors—and hasn’t for years. I see squatters’ laundry hanging on lines, smoke coming from windows, perhaps the product of makeshift stoves.\n\nWe walk into the low-ceilinged, dark rooms, which are lit only by a handful of small lanterns. The air smells familiar and almost comforting: dirt, leather, old books. Theo leans against the wall, folding his arms across his chest in exaggerated satisfaction, “Now what?”\n\n“Now,” says Paul, “we talk.”\n\nHe steps closer to me, lantern light slowly illuminating his features. This is the first time I’ve been able to really look at Paul’s face, and I draw in a deep breath. A pale, jagged scar runs along one side of his jawline, but otherwise, he reminds me so much of every other Paul I’ve known.\n\nAnd yet this moment I don’t see the Paul of the Mafiaverse, who shot Theo’s knees. I don’t see Lieutenant Markov. I don’t see the besotted soldier I betrayed in a San Francisco under siege; I don’t even see my own Paul.\n\nI see one man—one unique person, a stranger to me. This is the person I need to understand.\n\nBecause we have an opportunity, one none of us should waste.\n\n“You know I’m not the Marguerite from this world,” I say. They couldn’t have found me without Theo’s Firebird, otherwise; they wouldn’t have known what to look for.\n\nPaul nods. “You are, nonetheless, Marguerite Caine, the daughter of Doctors Henry Caine and Sophia Kovalenka, and a traveler through the dimensions.”\n\n“Just like you’re Paul Markov, my parents’ protégé and Triad’s enemy.” I nod toward Theo. “When do I get my version of him back?”\n\nSlowly, Paul smiles—a genuine smile. “Not long now. You like your version better?”\n\n“He never had a gang, or let anyone hold a gun on me.”\n\nThis world’s Theo has begun to scowl. “What are you doing with all the chitchat? We need answers from her, little brother.”\n\nAgain, they’re that close. I might not like this armed-and-dangerous Theo, but at least there’s something within him I would recognize.\n\nPaul says, “Be patient, Theo.”\n\n“What answers do you want?” I offer. “If you guys are anti-Triad, and I’m guessing you are, then we’re on the same side.”\n\nTheo, Paul, and the others all exchange glances. It’s Paul who says, “They’re your parents. Conley was your sister’s fiancé.”\n\n“My parents are grieving, and misguided. Wyatt Conley can’t be trusted, no matter what his motives are. And Triad—they’re trying to yoke together three dimensions so they can dominate all the rest. That’s not going to happen. Not if we help each other.”\n\nTheo shifts on his feet, restless. “She’s just saying what you want to hear.”\n\n“Doesn’t mean she’s not telling the truth.” Paul gestures toward a battered metal chair.\n\nI don’t sit until he does, too. His chair is farther away than I’d like for a conversation—it makes this too much like an interrogation. But I can work with it. This room obviously has no designated purpose; the furnishings in here run from office desks to these metal folding chairs to an honest-to-God wooden four-poster bed in the far corner. These guys are winging it too, which gives me more confidence when I ask, “What do you want to know?”\n\n“Your story, as you’d tell it.”\n\nSo I hit the basics: My parents being opposed to Conley, in this world and the other tied to Triad. The kidnappings. The hijacking of Theo’s body, and the subsequent Nightthief poisoning. Paul’s deliberate splintering. Conley’s demands that I work for him, and his ultimate plan. Deciding to finish with a flourish, I say, “In my universe, you and I are in love.”\n\n“In love.” Paul shakes his head. I can’t tell whether he doesn’t believe me, or he simply can’t picture it.\n\n“Madly. Deeply. But somehow, this is the second time in a few days that guys working for you have held me at gunpoint,” I add. “Which I’m sick of.”\n\n“You came looking for your Theo,” Paul says. “You’ll have to excuse ours for being so cautious.”\n\nApparently Theo doesn’t like being spoken about in the third person any more than I do. “We still don’t understand what she wants.”\n\nPaul nods as he gives me an appraising look. “If you’re so in love with this other version of me, why haven’t you run to rescue him yet? Obviously your Theo doesn’t need saving. We wouldn’t keep him here even if we wanted to.”\n\n“Which we don’t,” Theo adds. He gestures at the Firebird around his neck with disgust. “Knowing that guy’s all zoned out inside me? Creepy as hell.”\n\n“I didn’t come here to save Theo. Just to talk with him, and—” How do I put this to make them comprehend? “This is the Home Office. The universe where Triad started. That means the whole conspiracy started here. My parents and Conley have told me what they want—and I believe they told me the truth—but not the whole truth. There’s more to this, isn’t there? And this dimension is the only place I’ll ever get the answers. You guys are the best source I’ll ever have.”\n\nTo my satisfaction, that catches Theo short. But then he switches tactics. “We could use more Firebirds, and she’s wearing an extra.”\n\nI put one hand over my chest; the Firebirds press against my palm. “The second one isn’t extra. It’s for putting my Paul back together, and bringing him home.”\n\n“On behalf of my other self, I appreciate your commitment.” Paul leans forward, studying my face by lamplight."

        "content": "Hope flickers inside me. “Wait. Do you think—could you be the one with the last splinter of Paul inside?”\n\n“I doubt it,” he says evenly. “Your Conley gave you a final set of coordinates. He’s trying to win your trust, so I doubt he’d falsify that information.”\n\nProbably so. I slump back in my chair, disappointed.\n\nPaul remains focused. “You sabotaged the Firebird technology in one world, but made sure it survived in another.”\n\nI nod. “It’s not much. Still, we have to start somewhere. You guys are closer to the source. Maybe you know how we could get at Triad? Really take them down?”\n\nPaul and Theo exchange another glance. Theo says, “She could be spying on us for Conley.”\n\n“Or she could be telling the truth.” Paul’s eyes meet mine, searching.\n\nHe wants to believe in me. I wonder if that’s strategy or desperation.\n\nWhen Paul speaks again, he asks me the last question I would’ve expected: “Which version of me did you trust the most? And the least?”\n\nI don’t even have to think it over. “The Paul from my own universe.”\n\nHe cocks his head. “For which?”\n\n“For both.” My first leap into a new dimension comes back to me, as vividly as if I were still standing in London, rain spattering my face and hair, scrawling my mission on a poster: KILL PAUL MARKOV. “I trusted him the least, because it took me too long to understand him. When Triad framed him for my father’s death, I believed it.”\n\nPaul forgave me for that—no. To forgive me, he would have had to hold it against me in the first place. He never did. I would have walked away from a love like that.\n\n“But he’s also the one you trust the most?” Theo sits in a chair of his own, arms slung slightly backward, legs stretched before him.\n\nI nod. “Once I understood my Paul, I knew he would never knowingly hurt me, or anyone, except in defense. He’s always going to do what he thinks is the right thing—and yeah, sometimes we don’t agree on what that thing is, but his intentions are always good. He’d been lonely so long, before he found us. Every time I think about how lonely he was, it kills me a little inside.” Why couldn’t I have said all this to my Paul? I will, the first chance I get. The next universe over. My vision blurs as I blink back tears, refusing to cry as every other Paul I’ve known flickers through my mind, from a mobster’s son to my cherished Lieutenant Markov. He’ll have a place in my heart forever, and there are others I could have cared for, but . . . “I could go to a million universes and never find someone else who could make me feel this way. Only my Paul. Only him.”\n\nTheo makes a sound, totally familiar from my own Theo, like Spare me the sap. But Paul gives him a look that silences him instantly.\n\nTo me Paul says, “One thing’s certain—you’re not this world’s Marguerite Caine. Even if you’re not telling me everything, I can tell you hate Triad as much as we do.”\n\n“Great, here we go,” Theo groans. There’s no fire in his voice, though; he might gripe as he follows Paul’s lead, but he’ll follow.\n\nPaul rises to his feet. “Yes, we’re working with her, and with the other you. So brace yourself for a reminder.” Theo swears under his breath.\n\nI stand up too, happy to no longer be a captive. Paul’s understanding makes me suspect: “Did you travel between dimensions, when you were still with Triad?”\n\n“Once or twice.”\n\n“So which one of me did you trust the most, or the least?”\n\nIt’s supposed to be a lighthearted question, to break the tension. But Paul’s expression hardens, like the mobster’s did right before he fired. “I’d have to say you’re the version I trust the most.”\n\nMe? He hardly knows me.\n\n“Tell her the least,” Theo demands as he sits down, preparing himself for the painful jolt of a reminder. Paul says nothing. Theo laughs. “Fine, I’ll tell her.”\n\n“Tell me what?”\n\nTheo smirks up at me and says, “The version of you we trust the least is this one. Our own Marguerite Caine, the most loyal follower Wyatt Conley ever had—and the coldest bitch in the entire multiverse.”\n\n26\n\nI KEEP WAITING FOR PAUL TO TELL ME THEO IS JOKING, OR for Theo’s expression to finally shift into his usual cocky grin as he tells me the look on my face is priceless. They don’t.\n\nAlready I knew I was working for Wyatt Conley. But willingly? Why would I do that? As soon as I ask myself the question, though, I realize the answer. “It’s because of Josie,” I say. “My sister. I don’t know if you knew her—”\n\n“We did.” Paul speaks quietly, but whatever’s lurking behind his words, it isn’t sympathy.\n\n“My parents aren’t like this. Not in most dimensions. You must have seen that for yourself, right?” When Paul nods, and Theo’s smirk vanishes, I know I’m on the right track. “Here, they’ve lost one of their children, and they’ve fallen apart.”\n\nTheo folds his arms across his chest. “That’s no excuse.”\n\n“No, it’s not. Still, we just have to bring them around. All they want to do is see Josie again.”\n\nTheo snorts. “I’ll say.”\n\nThis version of Theo is kind of a snot. “What’s that supposed to mean?”\n\nIt’s Paul who replies, not with an answer but with another question. “You really don’t know, do you?”\n\n“Mom and Dad explained.”\n\n“Not everything. Not if you’re still defending them.” Paul looks at me as if—as if he feels sorry for me.\n\nIn the first moment I realized my parents were cofounders of Triad, shock and horror almost overwhelmed me. Those emotions well inside me again, deeper than before. “Tell me,” I whisper.\n\nPaul shakes his head. “If it comes from me, you won’t believe it. You’ll have to hear it from them yourself.”\n\n“It’s not all about Josie,” Theo shoots back. “For you, I mean. The Marguerite Caine in this universe loves screwing with all your minds. The power she has over her other selves—she gets off on it. Lives for it.”\n\n“How would you know?” I shoot back.\n\nPaul steps between us, maybe fearing what would happen if we really got into it. “I’m sorry, Marguerite, but it’s true. You say so yourself. You manipulate the lives of your other selves, just because you can. I’ve seen you quit schools, ruin paintings, wreck cars, pick fights.” After a long moment, he adds, more quietly, “Sleep with other guys. Other girls, once in a while. Whoever. It doesn’t matter to you, as long as it hurts someone.”\n\nHe won’t meet my eyes. He’s felt the emotions of another Paul who went through that.\n\nI keep my head high. “That doesn’t sound like me.”\n\nAgain with the snort from Theo. Paul at least has the decency to look sorry about what he has to say. “It sounds like the Marguerite Caine we know. She always says playing with other selves—seeing just how much she can change or destroy—she calls it an art form. Says it’s sculpting, but instead of clay, she uses lives.”\n\nA hollow feeling opens up in my belly, but I don’t let myself believe it. “Whatever. I’m not her, so deal with me. What do you want?”"

        "content": "“To keep Triad from expanding their power and taking over every world we could possibly reach.” Paul walks slowly around me, assessing me. Judging. “We know they brought you here deliberately.”\n\n“They’re trying to recruit me. They’re going to fail.” I step forward, breaking his orbit; he’s not the only one who decides whether we go forward here.\n\n“But you did their dirty work,” Theo says. “Apparently the other version of me told everyone that, before he went under.”\n\n“Then he also told you why. I did what I had to do to save you both. And at least once I was able to figure out how to turn Conley’s plan against him.”\n\nPaul gives Theo a look, like, You should’ve remembered that. “You’re right. If we’re going to defeat Triad, we’ll have to work together. As a perfect traveler, you should be able to fight off our Marguerite, if she ever came to your world—”\n\n“Which she won’t, because it wouldn’t be any fun for her, entering a body she couldn’t steal,” Theo says. For once I don’t mind the smug tone of his voice; I’m too relieved to hear that the wicked Marguerite won’t be knocking around in my head.\n\n“We work together,” Paul says, a little louder, an obvious hint to Theo that he shouldn’t interrupt again. “That may mean you come here to interfere with our Marguerite’s plans—even though they’ll be on the lookout for you.”\n\n“Fine. But how am I going to know when we should meet? Or where?” Our secret rendezvous could take place anywhere in the entire multiverse.\n\nAfter a moment, Paul says, “How do you think your Paul Markov would react to my entering your dimension for brief periods of time, only to communicate our plans?”\n\nLet my Paul be taken over by this one? I have no right to make that kind of deal. But if this is truly the only way . . . “I’m giving you permission to come once. When you do, I’ll let you know whether Paul has consented.”\n\nPaul’s expression shifts slightly, into something that might even be respect. “Agreed.”\n\nWe can do this. Finally, we’re one step ahead of the Home Office—\n\nRealization sweeps through me, wrenching and terrible. The other Marguerites I leap into remember everything that happened while I’m within them. Right now, I’m inside a Marguerite who’s on Triad’s side.\n\nWhen I tell Paul this, however, he’s unfazed. “It doesn’t matter. You had no other way of reaching out to us, and Conley would’ve suspected we’d try something like this anyway. We’ll change locations immediately after you leave.”\n\n“That’s enough to protect you?” I ask.\n\n“We’re as safe as we were before. Which is to say—not much, but enough.” Paul shakes his head, perhaps in wonder. “You actually care.”\n\n“I always care about you.” Lieutenant Markov’s words flicker in my memory—and despite everything I’ve seen on this journey, I can say them back to Paul now and mean them. “I would love you in any shape, in any world, with any past.”\n\nHe doesn’t reply right away. Anyone who didn’t know him as well as I do would think he’s unmoved. Instead, he’s both touched and doubtful. “You don’t love me in this one.”\n\nNot yet? Not ever? I say the only thing I absolutely believe to be true. “I could love you, then.”\n\nPaul breathes out heavily, as though he were weary. He doesn’t contradict me, though, and I know he recognizes the same thing I do—the potential. The eternal possibility. The kindling only awaiting a spark to burst into flame.\n\nHope brightens inside me. Three dimensions, three versions of Wyatt Conley are conspiring against me and my family. Now, finally, we have a conspiracy of our own. We have sources in the Home Office, and maybe beyond. The Conleys won’t always be one step ahead of us anymore.\n\nWhatever else he’s planning—we’ll get a chance to stop him.\n\n“You can ask my version for permission to visit his dimension right now, I guess.” Theo steadies himself as he holds up the Firebird. “Go on. Do it.”\n\nHe’s speaking to Paul, but I’m closer. So I duck down, take the Firebird from Theo’s hands, and hit the reminder sequence before he can protest. Although I manage to drop the Firebird just in time, some of the jolt burns my fingers. Theo winces and pushes back, his chair scraping on the floor—but when he looks up at me, he’s my Theo once more.\n\n“Whoa.” He leans forward, elbows on his knees, to let the rush pass through him. “If I remember the last few minutes correctly—first, I was being a jackass. Sorry about that.”\n\nI attempt a smile. “Apparently neither of us is much fun to hang out with in this dimension.”\n\nPaul’s tone changes when he’s speaking to my Theo; it’s more polite, yet more distant. “Do you recall our proposed plan?”\n\n“I think so. Work together. Two dimensions united against Triad. Which means letting this world’s Theo periodically take over my body.” Theo looks sheepish. “Seeing as how I’m in his body at the moment, I have to admit it’s a fair trade.”\n\nWhy only two dimensions? The Warverse might help, if we asked . . .\n\nBut I abandon this idea. How could we possibly get every world to cooperate? We’d have to visit back and forth so much that we’d hardly ever know who we were speaking to, and it would be easy for our ranks to be infiltrated by still other versions of ourselves.\n\nConspiracies make my head hurt.\n\nI focus instead on the best part of this. Between our two worlds, we might have the information and access needed to take Triad down, once and for all. It would be a relief, if it weren’t for Paul’s dark hint about my parents’ true agenda.\n\nTurning to Theo, I say, “Do you remember what this world’s Theo knows about my parents? What they’re up to?”\n\nHe shakes his head. “What they say and do is a lot more memorable than what they think. You get—emotional impressions, more than a recording of what’s going on in the cranium.”\n\nSo much for that plan. “Then we have to go to them and make them tell us.”\n\n“No,” Paul says sharply. “Not Theo. If your version leaps out and strands our version there—where he can be tracked—Triad will have him in jail within the half hour.”\n\n“I’ll go on my own, then. Though I actually don’t know where I live in this dimension.”\n\n“I can give you the address,” Paul says. “We have that information.”\n\nTheo gets up from the chair; even the way he stands is different. He’s steadier, more confident, but not as wary. “I don’t like this. You’re sending her alone, so her parents can tell her something you know but oh-so-conveniently won’t share.”\n\n“I’ll tell you now,” Paul says. “But as I said before, neither of you will believe me. Marguerite won’t rest until she hears it from them.”\n\nI step closer to him. “Try me.”\n\nHe pauses, and I wonder if we’ve caught this Paul Markov in a lie. Then I realize he’s hesitating before the words because he thinks they’ll hurt me. “Your parents—” Paul takes a deep breath, then finishes. “They don’t just want to visit Josie in other dimensions. They want her back in our world, for good.”"

        "content": "I would’ve known that even if Mom and Dad hadn’t already told me. “Wouldn’t you want your child back? But it’s impossible. Josie splintered into too many pieces. My parents know there’s no way they can ever re-create her again.”\n\n“There’s one way,” Paul says. “One thing they can do to every dimension Josie ever visited, to make sure each splinter of her consciousness returns home.”\n\nTheo and I glance at each other; he’s as bewildered as I am. This outstrips any of our research at home. I ask Paul, “What do they have to do to all those dimensions?”\n\nPaul speaks gently, as if he could soften what he says next. “Destroy them.”\n\nTwenty minutes later, I’m standing face-to-face with versions of my parents gone pale as ash.\n\nPaul gave me the directions to find them. This apartment must be what counts as luxury in this dimension, but to me it looks bare and soulless: no houseplants, no chalkboard wall scribbled with equations, no piles of books. I could almost believe my parents had chosen to live in a hotel room instead of a family home—it’s that impersonal and cold.\n\n“You tried to find your version of Theodore Beck, didn’t you?” Mom is doing that thing where she’s really mad but is trying to hold it back for a Reasonable Discussion. “Below is dangerous, sweetheart. You shouldn’t have—”\n\nI don’t need to hear it. “I found Theo. And Paul.”\n\nMy parents exchange a glance. Dad says, “I suppose you’re not going to tell us where they are.”\n\n“No, I’m not. You’re going to tell me what . . . what you’re going to do about Josie.”\n\nI don’t repeat what Paul told me out loud because I still don’t believe it. I can’t.\n\nMy father looks like he doesn’t know what to say, or that he’s too ashamed to say it. Mom, however, has regained her poise. The only sign of her discomfort is the way she hugs herself, as if she were trying to keep back the nonexistent cold. “Journeys through the dimensions are dangerous, even for a perfect traveler. Of course we don’t have to tell you that; you’ve faced considerable dangers yourself. Surely, at some point, you’ve asked yourself whether these journeys shouldn’t be abandoned completely.”\n\nI have, but the doubts have never been more than a whisper in the back of my mind. The amazing things I’ve been able to see—the different selves I’ve been, and gotten to know in other worlds—for me, that outweighs the scary parts. So far.\n\n“After Josie’s death, we first thought we should abandon the project altogether,” Mom continues. “The risks were too high to justify mere curiosity, or even technological advancement. But then your father and I spoke with Wyatt Conley, and we realized we had a new goal. One worth any cost. Worth every sacrifice.”\n\n“You want Josie back,” I say. “But what are you going to do to make that happen?”\n\nI want them to contradict me, to repeat that re-creating Josie after her splintering is an impossibility. Or if it isn’t, to tell me the solution is something justifiable.\n\nBut from the way my parents go still, I know Paul told me the truth. Triad may be motivated by sincere love for my sister—but their plans are more horrible than anything my Wyatt Conley ever dreamed of.\n\nMy mother walks closer, standing directly in front of me. “Marguerite, the splinters of Josie’s soul are scattered too widely for us to collect. But if that dimension could no longer contain her—”\n\n“Because it ceased to exist?” I ask.\n\nAfter a moment, my dad nods. “Nothing less would work.”\n\nI’m unnerved in a way that feels like physical disorientation, like the entire planet began spinning on a completely new axis. My whole life, I’ve joked about “Mom’s crazy theories,” though I always knew they weren’t crazy, just way out there. But what I see in my mother’s face now—and in my father’s, too—it’s insanity.\n\nNot the metaphorical kind. Real, true madness has claimed them both.\n\n“You can’t destroy an entire dimension.” I explain this slowly, like somehow that will help them understand. “Even if it weren’t completely evil—I mean, how? There’s no bomb big enough to take out a universe, much less several of them.”\n\n“Marguerite, think.” Mom goes into professor mode, startlingly familiar in this bizarre moment. “Resonances between the dimensions are remarkably sensitive, as you should know. Remember, they can only be altered to create a perfect traveler once in each dimension.”\n\nI’ve never understood the scientific explanation behind “resonances,” but the implications are clear. “Sensitive means—fragile. Breakable.”\n\nDad smiles, encouraging despite his strain, the way he acted when I kept having trouble learning to ride a bike. “And each universe strains to achieve perfect balance. All we have to do is return it to its fundamental symmetry.”\n\nThe memory of my walk in Muir Woods with Paul comes back so vividly I can smell the forest air. He stood in one small patch of light as he told me about the way that fundamental symmetry broke at the very dawn of creation. If it hadn’t—if matter and antimatter were equal, gravity and antigravity too—then the universe would destroy itself in an instant. We wouldn’t even know the disaster was happening—had happened—because time would collapse too.\n\n“How do you do that? How is it even possible?” I whisper.\n\n“The device is surprisingly simple,” my father says. “Bit of a surprise nobody thought of it before. Then again, if anyone did think of it, they had the sense not to build it.”\n\nI grab at the only hope I see. “But you can’t bring a device to another universe! Only consciousness can travel between dimensions. Not matter.”\n\n“Not most matter.” My mother points to the Firebird hanging around my neck. “We’ve been experimenting with various alloys and compounds. It won’t be long before we’re able to construct a device that can travel as easily as the Firebird. Though, of course, not just anyone can activate it. Most people would be erased in the universe’s collapse, without being able to escape.”\n\n“Only a perfect traveler,” I say.\n\nFinally it all makes sense. I knew Conley was too fixated on me, that there were too many other ways for him to get his dirty work done for him. What I didn’t know was just how dirty the work would be.\n\n“Wait, wait, wait.” I form the time-out sign with my hands. “You mean, you want me to destroy entire universes?”\n\n“Josie shattered into many pieces, too fragmentary to collect. But it wouldn’t be impossible to travel to each of those worlds. After all, you needn’t stay long.” Mom puts a hand on my shoulder, a touch meant to soothe that instead makes my skin crawl. “You won’t be killing anyone, Marguerite. The entire dimension will simply be erased from the multiverse. No one will feel any pain. No one will even know.”\n\nWhen a dimension died, it would take its entire history with it. The people within it wouldn’t die; they would never have been born.\n\nI think of the Warverse, of Josie as a fighter pilot. Or my parents as military researchers trying their hardest to keep their country’s hopes alive. Of Theo as the soldier who sneaked into my room at night and searched for moments of romance in that gray, scary time."

        "content": "Of that world’s Lieutenant Markov, who loved me so deeply, even when he knew I’d played him for a fool.\n\nI don’t dare return to that dimension, which means I’ll never see any of those people again. But they deserve to lead their own lives and find their own fates. To have their chance to win the war, and survive.\n\nAnd as much as it would hurt to learn that any of those people in the Warverse were dead, it would be infinitely worse to know that they had never been.\n\n“You don’t even understand what you’re asking me to do.” My voice shakes. “Destroying a dimension—that would be worse than genocide.” They want me to destroy entire species, planets, stars, countless galaxies.\n\n“Perhaps destroy is the wrong word,” Dad says, like a change in vocabulary would fix this. “Think of it as ‘unmaking’ the dimensions, and that’s really much closer to the mark.”\n\nThey’re so far gone they can’t even see it. I strike out with the first thing that comes to mind. “Josie would never accept this. Even if you succeeded, and you put her back together again, she would hate you for what you’d done.”\n\n“I feel sure Josephine will see reason,” my father says, with the same tone of voice he used when he and Mom didn’t let Josie get her ears pierced a third time.\n\nMy mother adds, “Keep in mind that Josephine traveled far longer than you have. She’s seen how many versions there are of us, in all the worlds. One version more or less in the multiverse makes very little difference, mathematically speaking.”\n\n“This is bigger than math! You can’t just swap one of us out for another!”\n\nMom seems almost irritated by my lack of comprehension. “All versions of us are the same person, on a very important level. Haven’t you seen that yet? Your Paul Markov—isn’t he the same one you love in every world, everywhere?”\n\nOnce I would have said yes. Now I know the truth is more complicated. As much as each version has in common with all the others, we’re still unique. Every single one of us, everywhere, is irreplaceable.\n\n“Your universe is safe,” Mom says. That shouldn’t make me feel better on any level, but it does. I’m coward enough to be glad we’re not first on the chopping block. “Perfect travelers are a scarce resource. We can’t go unmaking them right and left.”\n\n“You can see now why we need to keep the technology under wraps,” Dad chimes in. “If every dimension had this power, can you imagine the warfare that would result?”\n\nI shake my head. “But if you’re the only dimension with this power, it’s not a war. It’s just a slaughter.”\n\n“You make it sound so diabolical,” Dad says, as if it isn’t.\n\n“Please, sweetheart, think this over after you’ve had a chance to calm down.” My mother is openly pleading with me, in a way she never has before. Despite everything, she’s enough like my real mom that seeing her this way makes my heart hurt. “We want to work with you. We want to make this the best it can be for everyone involved. And we can give you so much.”\n\n“Like what?” The technology to turn our dimension into a hideous collage of Goya and Warhol, like theirs? That’s supposed to make up for turning me into a mass murderer?\n\nShe pauses; her eyes meet my dad’s. So Mom isn’t looking directly at me when she says, “We want to protect you, Marguerite. You’re our daughter too. But—if it came to it—Conley could travel to a new dimension and create another perfect traveler there.”\n\nI know what she means the instant she says it. But it’s like my brain refuses that knowledge. Instead, I flush hot all over, and my stomach cramps, as if I drank poison that has to get out of me now, because if it stays inside it will destroy me.\n\nMy parents would kill my universe. They would kill me. All because one version is as good as another, because they think we’re all fungible, replaceable, disposable—\n\n“You know that wouldn’t be easy for us,” Dad says, straightening. “We didn’t bring you to this dimension on a whim. You needed to learn the truth, though we’d hoped to break it to you more gently than this.”\n\nI spit my reply back at him. “There’s no ‘gentle’ way to tell me to kill billions of people.”\n\nHe continues as if I hadn’t spoken. “Take your time. Think things over. Discuss it with us back at home! When you fully comprehend the difference between death and nonexistence—that none of those people would suffer the way Josephine suffered—”\n\nDad’s voice chokes on a sob. My mother grabs his hand as he closes his eyes tightly. Somehow this is the worst of all—seeing that they’re still my parents, still capable of love and compassion, and yet willing to order the death of worlds.\n\n“I’m leaving,” I say, backing toward the door. “Don’t come after me.”\n\nBy this I mean, don’t follow me to the hallway, and definitely don’t follow me to my own world. But they don’t chase me. Mom and Dad simply stand there, looking sadder than I’ve ever seen them look in their lives.\n\nThey’re not only feeling sorry for themselves, though, or for the daughter who died. Mostly they feel sorry for me.\n\nI could jump out of this universe where I stand; instead, I go out the door. That way I can slam it behind me and create the illusion that they can’t chase me, that I can leave everything I’ve learned here behind.\n\nBut they can follow me anywhere, and they will, until they get what they want. Or else they’ll destroy my entire world.\n\n27\n\nWITH SHAKING HANDS, I SET THE COORDINATES MY PARENTS gave me—the ones that are supposed to lead to the final splinter of my Paul’s soul. I close my eyes, press down—\n\n—and slam into myself just in time to wobble out of control.\n\nI’m riding a bike, I think, in the split second before I crash into a ditch.\n\nGroaning, I scoot out from under my bicycle to see my knee red and raw, tiny droplets of blood beginning to bead up. Someone walking nearby says, in an English accent, “You all right, love?”\n\nHonestly, at the moment, it’s almost a relief to have my biggest problem be a skinned knee. “I’m fine, thank you.”\n\nThat came out with an English accent too. Do I live in London in this world as well? Seems really green for that . . .\n\nI look up and recognize where I am right away. Most people wouldn’t, but most people didn’t grow up surrounded by graduate students, who often carried brochures from the best physics departments in the world while they tried to figure out where to do their postdoc work.\n\nWhen I see the Bridge of Sighs, I know I’m in Cambridge.\n\nThis makes sense. Both my mother and my father could easily have wound up teaching here; in this world, they did. Now I have to figure out what else has changed.\n\nMy first task on leaping into a new dimension is always to understand the essentials as best I can: where I am, who I am. In this case, I desperately want to find Paul right away. I need him more than I ever have before. But for a moment I can only sit there in the grass, shaking, thinking of the lunatic versions of my parents I just left behind and what they want from me.\n\nGreen trees. The beautiful old university. Faraway sounds of traffic. Students laughing as they run across the grass. Triad might destroy this universe too."

        "content": "Focus, I tell myself. Freak out later. Find Paul now. Start by learning about this world.\n\nFirst I take a look at what I’m wearing: denim skirt, knee socks, Mary Janes, and a scratchy gray woolen sweater (should I say jumper)? Ordinary enough, if a little plainer than what I’d usually pick on my own. I like the floral scarf around my neck, though. The bicycle looks like one I’d pick in my world too—old-fashioned with fat tires, painted a happy shade of turquoise.\n\nMy purse is a cross-body bag in black leather; I open it up to see what I find. My hand and arm hurt as I riffle through things; maybe I banged myself up worse in the crash than I thought. This Marguerite must be more practical than I am, and thank goodness, because one of the first things I pull out is a Band-Aid. I put it over the skinned place on my knee, then go back to searching. Lipstick: some brand I don’t know called Sisley, but about the same color I’d wear at home. Sunglasses, cheap drugstore version, which is what I always buy because I never go more than two months without losing a pair. An e-reader—not a model I’m familiar with, but I can figure out how it works later. My phone, rock on. When I check to see whether it’s a tPhone, however, I’m momentarily confused; in this world, I seem to own something called an iPhone. I wonder who makes this one.\n\nAnd, yes, a wallet. I open it up to find a driver’s license, complete with address. Plenty of British money, the queen staring serenely at me from bills in different sizes and colors.\n\nA red mark mars the skin of my right wrist. When I push up the sleeve of my sweater, I reveal a long, livid scar. It’s not grotesque or anything, but the sight still makes me wince in sympathetic pain. From the look of it, this happened sometime in the past several months; maybe the scar will fade over time.\n\nBut when I close my fist, I feel the ache quivering up my arm and realize how serious the injury was. More than the skin was broken. This tore through muscle and bone.\n\nStill, it’s obviously healing, and for now I can manage. I start spelunking through the phone, which turns out to have as intuitive an OS as my own tPhone back home. The camera shows plenty of pictures of my family—Josie too, I’m relieved to see—and various friends I haven’t made in my own dimension.\n\nBut a quick search shows no pictures of Paul, and none of Theo.\n\nTime to search contacts. Nope, neither of them is listed.\n\nJosie is, though—and after learning what happened to her in the Home Office, I need to talk to her. So I go ahead and hit dial. After a few rings she answers, out of breath. “Marge?”\n\nMarge? Thank God my Josie never thought of that nickname. “Hey. How are you?”\n\n“Well, I’m fine.” She sounds so weird with an English accent. “Is something wrong at home?”\n\n“No, no!” Hopefully that’s true. “I just—I don’t know—I wanted to talk to you.”\n\nHer voice gentles. “Is everything okay?”\n\n“Yeah. Sure. But I was wondering how things were with you.”\n\n“I’m having the greatest time.” It’s as if I can see Josie’s grin. “The River Findhorn is seriously underrated for its whitewater rafting—it’s brilliant, Marge. Absolutely brilliant!”\n\nDoesn’t matter how different the accent is. This is definitely the Josie I know. “Glad you’re having fun.”\n\n“You’ll have to come up with me next time. I know you’re not sporty, but I promise, you’d adore it. And—I really do think you could manage. Despite everything.”\n\nOnce again I glance at the nasty scar on my wrist. “Next time’s a promise.” What the hell. I bet this Marguerite would enjoy rafting too. And surely whatever’s wrong with my arm will improve sooner or later.\n\n“You’re sure everything’s all right?” Josie obviously finds it weird that I called her in the middle of her big adventure for no reason.\n\nI try to cover. “Really, it is. But—um—last night I had this weird dream where you were gone, and I guess it made me miss you.”\n\nAfter a long moment, Josie laughs. “You’d never admit that to my face.”\n\n“Nope. So enjoy it now.”\n\nA little more chitchat—mostly about the smoking-hot Scotsman leading the rafting party—and then Josie hangs up. Simply hearing her voice for a few minutes was enough to make me feel better; it’s like I have her back again.\n\nFor now, I think, remembering what the Home Office wants. What they might do to this dimension, or another like it.\n\nA shiver passes through me. I stand up, righting my bike, because it makes me feel a bit stronger—but I don’t ride off yet. First I open a web browser and search for Paul Markov, physicist. The results light up immediately, and I smile. He’s here, at Cambridge.\n\nHe’s here. I’ll be with him before the day is out, maybe even as soon as I get home. I don’t understand why I don’t have any pictures of him yet—but maybe he didn’t begin grad school quite as young in this universe. Paul might be new here.\n\nI’m going to make everything right, I think. If you ever thought I didn’t love you for yourself, Paul, you’re wrong. And you can help me figure out how to stop Triad.\n\nThen I search for Theo Beck, physicist, because Theo should have jumped into this dimension right after I did. While I trust that Paul’s mercenary group in the Home Office meant what they said, I’ll still feel better after I’ve spoken to him. When the results come up, though, I frown.\n\nTheo’s in Japan?\n\nI email him, trusting that his leap into his other self will have woken him up. Sure enough, my phone rings only a few moments later.\n\n“The hell?” Theo says, instead of Hi there. “I’m sleeping on the floor in some kind of group lodge. There aren’t even any beds—”\n\n“That doesn’t sound like any Japanese dorm I ever heard of.” Not that I’m steeped in the legends and lore of Japanese dormitory life, but if their students all lived communally without beds, I think I’d have heard about it.\n\n“Hang on. I don’t want to wake anyone up. Let me get out of here.” I hear some shuffling, and the sliding of screens. Finally, Theo speaks again. “Okay. I’m on a porch. Proverbial dead of night, and—hang on, there’s some kind of brochure or something out here in a few languages—holy crap.”\n\nHe sounds freaked out. My hand tightens around the handlebars of my bike, until my wrist aches and I have to relax. “What? What is it?”\n\n“I’m on Mount Fuji.”\n\n“How are you—” Giggles bubble up inside me. Some of the terrible tension drains away. “What are you doing climbing a mountain?”\n\n“I do not know. But for some reason, I decided to do it today.” Theo sighs. “In related news, I’m not going to be able to reach you anytime soon. From your accent, I’m guessing you’re back in London?”\n\n“Cambridge.”\n\n“Got it. Is Paul there?”\n\nThe faint strain in his voice would be inaudible to most people. “Yeah. I mean, he’s not here right this second, but he’s at Cambridge too. I should be able to get to him today.”\n\n“Good. That’s good.” There’s a long pause before Theo says, “Did you get any clarification on the collapsing-dimensions thing?”"

        "content": "Tension returns, a dull weight on my chest. “It’s true. In the Home Office, my parents think—you know, what’s a few universes more or less?”\n\n“That is as effed-up as it gets. How close are they to being able to do it? They’d need a device that could move through dimensions like the Firebird, one that could affect fundamental resonance—”\n\nHe’s already theorized that far ahead. It gives me hope that we might be able to outfox the Home Office yet. “They don’t have the device, but they’re heading into tests. So not long.”\n\n“Damn. Maybe I ought to head back home. The sooner I get there, the sooner I can tell Henry and Sophia what’s happening.”\n\n“They need to know.” But it feels weird to say, Sure, fine, go on without me.\n\nTheo’s been by my side this entire trip. More than that: I’ve realized how much more we can be to each other. Paul is the only one I love, but I’ve connected with Theo on an entirely new level. The friend I cared for so much before the Triadverse and the Home Office started screwing with our lives—I have that Theo back. And I’m so glad.\n\nI can’t talk about any of that here and now. Theo wouldn’t want to hear it, not this way, not yet. So I say only, “If I don’t get home within twenty-four hours, come back and get me, okay?”\n\n“Always,” Theo says.\n\nThe tone in his voice is supposed to sound casual. It doesn’t. Just beneath the surface lurks a kind of longing I still don’t know how to deal with—but I don’t have to. Theo hangs up without even waiting for my goodbye.\n\nFor a moment I stand there, staring down at my phone screen. I wish I could call him back; I almost wish I could say what he really wants to hear. But I shouldn’t, and I can’t.\n\nInstead, I find the Maps app and plug in the address on my driver’s license. It’s time to go home.\n\nMy trip takes me along the side of the River Cam almost the whole way, so I’m able to enjoy the scenery and the new warmth of a spring day. Gripping the handlebars makes my right arm ache beneath the red scar, but I can deal with it. In this dimension, it seems we live in a Victorian town house not very far from the university and city center—not far over the river at all. Parked in front is an absurdly small car in brilliant apple green. At first the grand yellowstone edifice of the town house looks so much like someone else’s home that I’m reluctant to walk inside.\n\nThen I see tangerine orange sparkle in one window: a suncatcher, dangling mid-pane just like it does at home. Reassured, I cycle up the driveway, lock my bike, and head inside.\n\nThe moment I open the door, I hear this strange jangling sound—and then a black pug runs into the hallway to greet me, all scrunchy nose and dangling tongue. Laughing, I duck down to pet him.\n\nAt last a dimension where my parents let us own a dog! I’ll have to figure out how this Marguerite and Josie managed it.\n\n“Who is it, Ringo, buddy?” My father’s voice comes closer with every word. “Has Xiaoting come to see us—oh! What are you doing home already, sweetheart? Did the first showing sell out?”\n\nHe looks so like my dad back home, with his fusty cardigan and permanently mussed hair, that I want to melt. No more strange, crazy Dad manipulating and threatening the dimensions—just one like the Dad I know and love. “Yeah,” I say, having no idea what movie I was going to see. “I got there too late.”\n\n“All right, then.” He gestures for me to come farther into the house, as Ringo the pug runs to his side, panting happily. “At least you’re here in time to tell Susannah goodbye.”\n\nSure enough, as I walk into the small but bright kitchen, I see my aunt Susannah, wearing a leopard-print wrap dress and her trademark fuchsia lipstick. My mother—looking entirely like herself—is nodding in genial incomprehension as Aunt Susannah says, “And if you’re not flying business class, I say, it’s hardly even worth it. Because in coach, you might as well be cattle, you know— Oh, Marguerite, darling? Back so soon?”\n\n“The movie was sold out.” I stick to the excuse Dad supplied; no point in overthinking anything. Besides, I’m truly glad to see her. At home, it’s been years since we visited—but Aunt Susannah was my guardian and caretaker in the very first new dimension I visited, and after hearing about her death in the Warverse, it’s good to see her standing here, alive, well, and flamboyant as ever. “When do you leave?”\n\n“Your dad’s driving me to the train station at quarter past. So I get to tell you goodbye twice!”\n\nShe holds out her arms. Normally I’d try to dodge this, but now I walk into her embrace and hug her tightly. Her overripe perfume has never smelled better.\n\nAunt Susannah laughs, surprised but pleased. “Aren’t you a dear? Henry, Sophia, you must send her to London with me this summer. We can go shopping for all the latest fashions, so you knock ’em dead at Oxford come fall.”\n\nOxford? I applied to the Ruskin School of Fine Art and got in? Pride and hope swells within me. If this Marguerite could get in, maybe I could too. I don’t know if they take students starting in January—but I could go to their next SoCal portfolio review and find out.\n\n“I think a London trip could be arranged,” Dad says. “But if we’re going to make the six-forty-five train, you and I had better hoof it.”\n\n“Right-o.” After a couple of pats on my shoulder, Aunt Susannah lets go. I’m surprised to feel a lump in my throat as she waves. “We’re off, then. See you soon, my dears.”\n\n“Goodbye, Susannah.” My mother always has this look on her face when she’s around my dad’s sister—slightly overwhelmed, slightly confused—but in this dimension, there’s also a deep fondness.\n\nOnce Dad and Aunt Susannah go, it’s just me, Mom, and Ringo the pug. While my mother is busy putting together dinner—a Bolognese sauce by the smell of it, yum—I do some quick reconnaissance of the house. This looks like a place we’d live: books, plants. And my room is filled with oil portraits in a style very like my own back home. Josie, Mom, and Dad form a triptych on the wall, each vibrant in their own way. Yet I recognize the brushstrokes, the blended colors, the light. I could have painted any one of these myself.\n\nPaul wasn’t just being encouraging that night we talked in his dorm room; he was telling me the truth. Have I really been selling myself short this whole time?\n\nIf I could get into Ruskin, Paul could do his postdoc either there or here at Cambridge. It doesn’t take very long to get to Oxford from Cambridge, or vice versa. We’d be able to see each other every weekend at least. It can all work out, if we only try.\n\nSo I don’t let it bother me that Paul’s portrait isn’t hanging on the wall.\n\nWhat’s weirder is that my easel isn’t out. I don’t see a box of paints; when I look in the hamper, it contains exactly zero paint-stained smocks. (I’m supposed to wash them separately, but sometimes I forget, with disastrous results for the rest of the laundry.) I’m supposed to be starting at Ruskin soon. Shouldn’t I be practicing?\n\nI head back to the living room, which is smaller than the one we have at home, but equally comfy. Plopping down on the overstuffed red sofa, I’m immediately joined by Ringo, who wants a belly rub. As I oblige him, Mom walks in from the kitchen, drying her hands on a tea towel. “There,” she says as she sits near me. “We’ll put the pasta on when your father gets back.”"

        "content": "“Sounds good.” If Paul’s a physics student at Cambridge, even if I haven’t met him yet, my parents must have. “Have you seen Paul Markov lately?”\n\nMy mother sits up straighter. “Have you seen him around?”\n\n“I—uh, no. I haven’t.”\n\n“Oh, sweetheart.” She scoots closer to put her hands on my shoulders. “Are you still upset? I don’t blame you.”\n\nUpset? “I’m fine. Really.”\n\n“You wouldn’t be asking after Paul, if you really were.” Mom sighs. “Your father and I begged for more stringent measures, but the university code is as clear as it is lenient. Technically, he’d broken no university rules. So we couldn’t expel him from the program. I almost wish we hadn’t already canceled the Firebird project, so we could’ve had the satisfaction of tossing him out of that, at least. But other professors are supposed to be working with Paul from now on! They should have kept him out of your way—”\n\n“I didn’t see him! Okay? It’s all right.” It’s beyond weird to see my mother talking about Paul without a trace of affection, or even grudging respect.\n\nWhat I see in her eyes is pure loathing.\n\nShe rubs my shoulder gently. “I promise you, Marguerite—I absolutely promise—Paul will never come near you again. Never.”\n\nJust when I think I’m home safe, the whole world turns upside down again.\n\n28\n\nTHIS TIME I GO THROUGH THE BEDROOM LIKE A FORENSICS team scouring a crime scene. Her closet is emptied out across the bed, every pocket in every coat or pair of jeans searched through. Each and every drawer gets inspected. The spines of each book on this Marguerite’s shelf, and the titles of all the ones in her e-reader, are reviewed. I learn a few things about her—she’s confident wearing heels, she shares my mother’s passion for yoga, she’s a bigger fan of the surrealists than I am. But I don’t find the stuff that would tell me what I want to know.\n\nWhat happened with Paul?\n\nNo blog. No journal. I don’t keep those at home either, but why couldn’t this have been another way she’s different from me? The various apps on her phone show me the photos she’s shared, her latest updates; all of it looks much the way it does on my own phone at home, except that, of course, she has lots of dog photos.\n\nWhen I scroll all the way back to January, I finally see a picture of Paul. In it, he’s sitting on our red sofa, Ringo happily in his lap. Paul looks completely at ease. At home. And now my parents don’t even want to see his face.\n\nSlightly heated by the exertion of ripping up this Marguerite’s bedroom, I push up the sleeves of my sweater. When I do, beneath my thumb I feel the crooked ridge of the scar on my right arm. The scar seems darker now, which I know is my mind playing tricks on me because the ache has returned.\n\nWell, if I can’t find out anything else about this world’s Paul, I can at least learn how to contact him.\n\nA little time on her tablet turns up Paul’s contact information without too much trouble. The university lists his housing and his email address, at least his school account. With a flick of my fingers, I open a window to write to him, then hesitate.\n\nMom wanted Paul thrown out of Cambridge—the same guy they practically adopted in at least a dozen dimensions. Anytime my parents and Paul have wound up at odds, Paul was the one who drew the line between them.\n\nThe fourth and final splinter of my Paul is here, sheathed within the body of this other Paul Markov. No matter what he’s done, or what he’s capable of, I have to face him. We have to be alone.\n\nUntil then, I refuse to worry. During my time traveling through the dimensions, I’ve been kidnapped, held at gunpoint, bombed from the air, nearly crushed in a submarine, exposed to the Russian winter until I nearly died of hypothermia, and chased by a torch-bearing mob intent on burning me for witchcraft. Every time, I’ve kept myself together. Every time, I survived.\n\nWhatever happens next, I have to believe I can handle it. For Paul, I will.\n\nThe email I send to Paul is simple and direct.\n\nYou and I should talk, soon. Are you free tonight? If so, let me know what time, and I’ll drop by your flat.\n\n(At the last minute, I remembered to use “flat” instead of “apartment.”)\n\nIt would be easy to spend the next however-long staring at my in-box, hoping every second to see his reply. But that would only drive me crazy, and besides, Mom made spaghetti.\n\n“Susannah keeps insisting we should visit her in London this summer,” Dad says as he covers his plate with more Parmesan than most people could eat in a month.\n\nMom looks nonplussed. “But we go every summer, at least for one or two of the plays. I think I read that they’re putting on Julius Caesar at the Globe in June.”\n\nMy father shakes his head. “Oh, no, she’s having none of our weekend jaunts. Susannah wants us for a fortnight at least.”\n\nMore than a weekend sounds like a very long time to stay with Aunt Susannah, let alone two weeks or however long a fortnight is. To judge by the sound my mother makes, she agrees. It’s kind of sweet that my aunt wants us there, though. At home, our relationship is so much more distant, because my dad and his sister are practically scientific proof of just how different two offspring of the same parents can be. I like that we all found a way to get along here.\n\nAs I eat, it’s tough to keep my aching fingers tightened around anything as slender as a fork. My mother is watching me, her face falling as she sees me struggle with my utensils. Quickly I change the subject. “I had the strangest dream last night.”\n\n“Oh, really?” Dad raises an eyebrow in mild curiosity. At his feet, Ringo sits, panting, alight with hope that one of us will drop food.\n\nI try to sound casual. “Yeah. In my dream, we all lived in San Francisco, and we looked and acted like ourselves but had these different lives—and then I realized, this wasn’t my dimension. I’d traveled to another dimension with the Firebird, to see how we lived there. It was so weird how I knew the Mom and Dad and Josie I saw there weren’t you guys, but at the same time they kind of were. I felt like I remembered the whole house, the whole neighborhood, everything.”\n\nMom and Dad give each other a wistful look. “I suppose it might have been like that,” she says, idly twirling her fork in her pasta. “Sometimes I still daydream about it—truly standing within another dimension.”\n\n“It could still happen,” I venture. “Couldn’t it?”\n\nDad sighs. “No point in going back to it now. The Firebird project might have been our greatest glory, but it could also have been our greatest folly. Better to turn our energies to more productive ends.”\n\nOh, come on. No way Mom and Dad would give up on their dream just because they thought it was impractical.\n\nAt least now I understand why Conley sent the final splinter of Paul here. Since the Firebird technology had been scrapped, there was no chance my parents would figure out what was going on—and no chance they could have used devices of their own to get him back home.\n\nThen my mother says, “Sending information will be so much more useful than sending consciousness.”\n\nI pause, spaghetti slithering off my fork as I hold it above my plate. “How, exactly?”\n\nShe looks dubious, and I wonder if I’ve exposed myself; this world’s Marguerite would surely know more about her parents’ current research. Instead, Mom says, “You’re right to insist that I keep explaining myself. If we don’t revisit our first principles, we run the risk of losing our way.”"

        "content": "Dad goes into professor mode. “Now, Marguerite, what do you know about information? What is the most peculiar thing about it?”\n\nMaybe that sounds like a really broad question, but I understand what he’s driving at. “Information is the only thing we know of capable of moving faster than the speed of light. The universe knows things it shouldn’t know, before it should be able to know them. Like—like when a quark is destroyed, and another is created instantly to take its place.” Paul told me this, too, as we stood in the redwood forest, looking up into infinity.\n\n“Exactly,” my mom says. “Transferring consciousness—as exciting as it would be, and as revolutionary as it would be even to identify and isolate consciousness—it’s not the best way of learning more about the other dimensions of the multiverse. We can structure ‘messages’ in the form of asymmetrical subatomic sequences and see how other quantum realities respond.”\n\n“If we figure out how best to handle this, we might even be able to speak directly to other versions of ourselves—or, at least, to the other scientists doing our kind of work,” my father adds. “Much better than popping into someone else’s body unannounced.”\n\nI think of the Grand Duchess Margarita, even now hiding out in a Danish country house until she gives birth to a baby—one I conceived for her. Of a Theo in New York City who’s still in the hospital, wondering if he’ll ever be able to walk again. Of Lieutenant Markov dead in my arms. I admit, “The ethics are a lot better.”\n\nMom nods, but I can tell to her this is only a theoretical consideration, one she’s never had to truly face. “We’ll have far better reach, as well. Instead of only visiting universes where we ourselves exist, we should be able to learn something about virtually any dimension in the multiverse— Henry. Stop giving noodles to the dog.”\n\n“He likes noodles,” Dad says, as Ringo slobbers down his one strand of spaghetti.\n\nMy parents the illustrious scientists begin debating whether or not pasta gives the dog gas. It offers me a moment to consider what I’ve just learned, the possibilities expanding in my mind every moment.\n\nThe Home Office and the Triadverse must have dismissed this dimension as a threat because Mom and Dad abandoned the Firebird project. What Conley never realized was that they would instead turn their attention to another way of contacting other universes. If we got that power—my world, and the Warverse, and even the Paul and Theo from the Home Office—and we could communicate with each other constantly, without the risks of jumping dimensions . . . we could form an alliance much larger than Triad’s conspiracy. Much more powerful. We could prepare ourselves against any attack the Home Office could make.\n\nThis could be how we take them down.\n\nAs precious as the treatment for Theo is, as eager as I am to rescue my own Paul, I now know I’m bringing home a third treasure—or, at least, a chance. The coordinates to this dimension could save us all.\n\n“How long?” I ask.\n\nMom huffs, “Until the dog begins stinking up every room he’s in? Two hours at most.”\n\n“No. I mean—how long until you can communicate with other dimensions?”\n\n“Sweetheart, you know we can’t pinpoint these things,” my father says, but with a smile. “Of course, if next month’s test goes as well as we hope . . . wait and see.”\n\nIt’s all I can do not to laugh out loud.\n\nAs I walk back to my room, I’m already strategizing. I’m not going to “de-cloak” yet; first I should talk with my parents back home about everything we’ve learned. But as soon as I do that, we can start planning my return to this dimension. Then we can tell the truth, the whole honest truth, and get these versions of ourselves to join forces with us. Exhilaration bubbles inside me until I want to spin around and do some stupid victory dance. Once I’m alone in my room, I might.\n\nHowever, when I look at my email, every other thought fades, replaced only by the sight of Paul’s name in my in-box.\n\nWhen I open his reply, it says only 8:30 p.m.\n\nHe’s not exactly Mr. Talkative in my dimension either. This is all the information I asked for, the only thing I need.\n\nStill, when I remember Mom’s distrust of Paul, her fear for me, Paul’s terseness becomes . . . unnerving.\n\nBut it won’t stop me from going to him, and bringing my own Paul home.\n\nCambridge must be a relatively safe place, because when I tell them I want to go to the theoretical late show of whatever movie it was this world’s Marguerite wanted to see on campus, Mom doesn’t even look up from her reading as she nods. Dad says only, “Wouldn’t you rather take the car?”\n\nOf course he lets me drive only in a universe where I’d have to stay on the left side of the road. “I’m good.”\n\n“I’m glad you’re exploring your interest in film,” he says. “Definitely something to pursue.”\n\nMom chimes in, suddenly much more interested. “So many people talented in one art form prove to be talented in another.”\n\nMaybe this world’s Marguerite is thinking of becoming a movie director. I can’t quite imagine it, but that’s kind of cool.\n\nAs I cycle through the streets of Cambridge, my phone chirpily tells me where to turn and how far to go. Not all of the city is as picturesque as the university; I cross a few busy roads lined with buildings more blandly modern. The chain store signs lit for nighttime bear unfamiliar names: BOOTS, COSTA, PIZZA EXPRESS. But my directions keep me near the university and finally steer me toward a group of small, basic apartments immediately recognizable as the kind of place where students live.\n\nI lock my bike, walk straight to Paul’s door, and ring without hesitating.\n\nBefore my hand is back at my side, Paul opens the door.\n\nHe looks thinner in this dimension, and not in a good way; his clothes are the same shabby stuff he wears at home, but they hang on his frame, like he doesn’t even care enough to get stuff that fits. Still, he’s neat, and from the faint smell of shaving foam, I can tell Paul cleaned up for me. He’s trying.\n\n“Hi,” he says. “Thanks for reaching out. It—it means a lot.”\n\n“Can I come in?”\n\nPaul seems astonished. Did he really think I’d stand here and question him from the doorstep?\n\nBut he stands back for me to walk into his apartment. It’s as small and plain as I would have thought, with worn, mismatched furniture bought at the Salvation Army or whatever the British equivalent is. Tidy, though—especially for a male college student. My Paul keeps things neater than virtually any other guy I’ve ever known; I wonder if the white-glove cleanliness of this room is something this world’s Paul shares with mine, or whether it’s the subconscious influence of my own Paul peeking through.\n\nI ought to just press the Firebird against him now, get my Paul back, and get out of here. But something about this Paul’s quiet misery touches me. He’s hurting—terribly—and he seems to think talking with me would help.\n\nI can give him that. His body has kept the last part of Paul’s soul safe; we owe him.\n\nInstead of hi or how have you been, Paul says, “Will you let me explain?” When I blink, surprised, he continues, “I guess that’s why you’re here. If it’s not—”"

        "content": "“It’s complicated.” About a thousand times more complicated than you could possibly guess. Still, I ought to hear this. “Yeah, go ahead. Explain.”\n\nPaul stands there, looking lost in the way that always makes me want to shelter him. “It was an accident. Even your parents must know it was only an accident. I hate myself for it more than they ever could. Even more than you.”\n\nHis eyes don’t meet mine; instead, he’s looking down at my forearm, at the ragged red welt I noticed earlier today. The ache has sunk down to the bone. I glance down at the scar, then back up at him.\n\n“I was upset. We both were. So I shouldn’t have been driving. You’re not wrong to blame me for that.” By now Paul is pleading. “But your dad seems to think I did it on purpose. Marguerite, I would never, ever have wanted you to get hurt.”\n\nWe were in a car accident while Paul was driving. It screwed up my hand. But why do my parents hate him? A car accident could happen to anybody. Why have I refused to even see him?\n\nThen I remember what Paul said first. I venture, “We . . . were upset.”\n\n“It all seems so stupid now,” he says. “I wasn’t going to come around the house anymore, and you said I should get over it. Deal with my disappointment, forgive your parents. God, I wish I had. Then you’d be fine, and we’d be happy, and you could still—”\n\nPaul chokes on his own words, then sits down heavily, too upset to notice my confusion.\n\nSlowly I say, “If you could do it over—without yelling this time—if we were back in that car, what would you tell me?”\n\nHe wasn’t expecting that. But he tries to work with it. “I would say that just because I disagreed with Sophia and Henry about the Firebird technology didn’t mean I felt any differently about you. When I avoided the house, I wasn’t avoiding you. Only them. I felt like the greatest work of my life had been taken away from me.”\n\nOf course. Paul would have hated their decision to abandon the Firebird project. Once he tackles a question, he doesn’t want to rest until he has the answer.\n\nPaul continues, “I shouldn’t have said angry things about your parents—at all, but especially not in front of you. It put you in a terrible position. And I guess it made it easier for them to hate me afterward.”\n\nIf I’d had time to calm down after this awful argument in the car, honestly, I probably would have understood. As much as I love my parents, they still drive me crazy sometimes. And I would have realized what a crushing blow this was to his research and his hopes. So I still don’t get why he’s so freaked out about the accident.\n\nUntil he says, very quietly, “Are you any better? I mean—have you been able to paint?”\n\nIt all comes together, then: Paul’s crushing guilt, my parents’ anger. The lack of any art supplies or new paintings in my room. Spaghetti falling off a fork that hurts to hold—a fork that’s still wider than most paintbrushes. My parents encouraging my new “interest in film,” because they’re afraid I’ll never be able to paint again.\n\nThis tragedy belongs to the other Marguerite, not me. When I go home, my arm will be fine—unmarked—and I can paint as much as I need. But still, I feel the pain of this Marguerite’s loss. Art is the only thing I’ve ever wanted to do. It’s my vocation, my passion. And dammit, I’m good! Not many teenagers get their own gallery showings. Not many have the skills that could get them into RISD, much less Ruskin. As hard as it is to make a living as a professional artist, I honestly believe I have a chance.\n\nIn this world, Marguerite’s chance has been taken away.\n\nMaybe my hand will get better, I think. But already I know this Marguerite’s doctors don’t hold out much hope. If there were hope, Paul wouldn’t be sitting here in misery. My parents wouldn’t hate him.\n\nAnd this Marguerite wouldn’t either.\n\nI say the only thing I can think of. “It didn’t help that we were arguing when it happened. That I was already mad at you.”\n\nHe shakes his head. “No, it didn’t. But you’re not wrong to blame me. I drove the car. It was my responsibility to pull over if I was—distracted. I didn’t, and I hurt you, and I swear to you, if I could go back in time and change things—even if I had to get between you and the other car, take the hit myself—I’d do it. I would.” Paul makes a small sound, something that might have been a laugh but didn’t quite make it. “Too bad we never tackled time travel.”\n\n“Mom and Dad shouldn’t have tried to throw you out of the department. Not for that.”\n\n“Sophia and Henry felt guilty for not protecting you. For bringing me into your life.” Paul meets my eyes only for a moment. “No, they weren’t—reasonable. But there are worse things parents can do than loving their child so much that it made them unreasonable.”\n\nWorse things, such as being mixed up in organized crime, and being more loyal to the mob than to your own son. His betrayal by his parents makes him willing to forgive mine for turning on him.\n\nI remember the way my mother talked to me after I first told her Paul and I were together. She said that as much as they cared about Paul, they’d always be on my side—even if I was wrong. I guess she was telling the truth. And now, after the Home Office, I’ve seen how my parents react to grief. It twists them up. Makes them lash out.\n\nPaul dismisses the near-ruin of his academic career with a shrug. “I’m going to ETH Zurich for my postdoc. I’ll move away as soon as I possibly can. You don’t have to worry about me anymore, or ever again. I promise you.”\n\n“I believe you,” I say. He breathes out, like he’d been holding his breath for a very long time. Paul doesn’t ask for or expect forgiveness or redemption. He only wants me to feel safe.\n\nWhat will happen to this world’s Paul? Will he find other people to love him in Zurich? Mentors who become adoptive parents, like mine, can’t come along that often.\n\nPaul studies my face; I wonder what he sees there. Finally he says, “Is that all?”\n\n“Not quite. Do me one favor?”\n\n“Anything.”\n\nI get to my feet and take the spare Firebird from around my neck. He looks at it, uncomprehending; apparently the project didn’t progress far enough in this dimension for him to recognize it on sight. So I simply say, “Hold still.”\n\nPaul nods, and remains rigid in his chair, not even looking directly at me as I drape the chain around his neck. Once all four splinters of my Paul’s soul are reunited, he should awaken within this body.\n\nPlease let it work. Please let Conley not have lied to me. Please, please, let me have him back again.\n\nI take a deep breath, hit the final sequence and drop the Firebird.\n\nHe jolts, grabs the arms of his chair, and opens his eyes wide. When he looks up at me, he whispers, “Marguerite?”\n\nMy Paul, at last.\n\nWe reach for each other at the same instant, and somehow I wind up in his lap, and we’re embracing each other so tightly we can scarcely breathe. Everything I’ve had to do, everything I’ve gone through—it was all worth it for this. For him.\n\n29\n\nWE HANG ON TO EACH OTHER SO TIGHTLY THAT NOTHING could tear us apart. Paul’s broad hands span my back as he rocks me; I kiss his mouth, his cheeks, his eyelids, his chest. Even our breaths rise and fall in the same rhythm, as if we’d merged together. As if I’d leaped not into another version of myself, but into him."

        "content": "“I was so scared,” I manage to choke out. “You were torn apart. Conley tore you apart—”\n\n“You mean—my consciousness—”\n\n“Splintered. Conley splintered you into four pieces.”\n\nHe swears in Russian. “I only remember this world at all. None of the others.”\n\n“Well, trust me, you were all over the place. Italy and New York and even a terrible world war. You really don’t remember that?”\n\n“I only remember being here. We’ll deal with the theory later. I’m all right now.” Paul kisses my neck, then frames my face in his hands. “I didn’t find the cure for Theo before they caught me.”\n\n“It’s okay! I got it for him. We—well, we had to do some dirty work for Triad, but it’s all right, because I think I know how to turn it against them.”\n\nHe frowns, no doubt wondering just how dirty the work was. But then I see his expression begin to cloud over. “A few minutes ago—the things I said—”\n\n“Forget it. That’s between another Paul and another Marguerite. It doesn’t have anything to do with us.” Knowing that makes me feel so impossibly, perfectly free. Like I could soar on wings, carrying Paul upward with me.\n\n“But I hurt you.” Paul looks down at my scarred wrist.\n\n“Not on purpose. And it wasn’t you, just like it wasn’t me. Okay?” Explaining this to Paul will take time, just like it took me a long while to believe it.\n\nHe doesn’t look like he can fully accept that. “You—she can’t be an artist anymore.”\n\nThat hurts, even if it isn’t me. But I say to him what I hope this Marguerite will someday understand—something I might need to consider myself, really. “There are other careers. Other ways to be creative and lead a good life. She’ll figure it out.”\n\nPaul isn’t comforted. “Theo’s safe?”\n\n“Yeah. He even came on the trip with me, because he said if you’d do it to rescue him, he’d do it to rescue you.”\n\n“That idiot,” Paul says, in a tone of voice that makes it the most affectionate thing he could possibly say. “Where is he now?”\n\n“Japan. I mean, in this universe Theo Beck is getting his doctorate in Japan, but our very own Theo has already leaped home. He’ll be waiting there for us.”\n\nPaul looks around at this apartment. “This Paul—” He laughs slightly, but without humor. I can tell he’s embarrassed by how far this version has sunk. “He needs to get a life.”\n\n“Yeah, probably. Look at it this way; at least you’re not stuck in an apocalyptic war. Is that coming back to you at all?”\n\nIf it is, he might remember me making out with another Paul. Uh-oh.\n\nInstead, he shakes his head. “This world is the only one I have any memory of. I think there was . . . more of me here than anywhere else.”\n\n“Well, you didn’t miss out on much in the Warverse.”\n\nI throw it out merely to distract him, but Paul latches on to the new information. “Conley hasn’t forced you into working with him, has he?”\n\n“Not any more than this,” I promise.\n\n“What aren’t you telling me?”\n\nThere’s so much, and the threat of the Home Office is almost too terrifying to speak out loud. Right now I only want to go home with Paul.\n\nBut Theo’s back where he belongs, safe and sound. He’s telling my parents the risks even now. Paul and I are together in each other’s arms. There’s no reason not to talk, if that’s what he needs.\n\nSo I begin in Italy, with Conley’s announcement of what he’d done, and say it all. If I hold anything back, it will only make it more awkward to talk about later. So I tell him about appearing in the bed beside Theo, in a world where I chose differently. I explain how I flattered him to try and get secrets, and that we kissed—that I hurt that world’s Paul, and he lashed back. But I emphasize the deal we cut above everything else. “They’ll be okay, so I didn’t do any harm. I didn’t have to play Conley’s game. See?”\n\nPaul nods. He looks like he’s in shock. “And then what?”\n\n“Then I went to a New York where—where you went into business with your dad.”\n\nHis entire body tenses. I realize he wants me out of his lap, so I stand; Paul begins pacing the length of the room. “I couldn’t have. I would never.”\n\n“Not often,” I say as gently as I can. “But in at least one universe.”\n\n“How did you know? How did you find out?”\n\n“I might have reached out to you in a way that freaked out your, um, colleagues and—well, they kidnapped me.”\n\nHe blanches. “Oh God. My father didn’t—”\n\n“I wasn’t hurt. Paul—you know you could have talked to me about your dad. I wouldn’t have judged you for the things he’s done.”\n\n“Things I would do.” His voice has gone dull. “In the right circumstances.”\n\n“Don’t obsess over—”\n\n“How did you escape? I know you wouldn’t have left the other Marguerite there.”\n\n“Theo led the cops to my location. I was able to get out.”\n\nPaul steps closer to me. “You’re keeping something back.”\n\n“While Theo and I were trying to get away, you found us. When I retrieved that splinter—I think it made you angry.”\n\n“And?”\n\nDeep breath. “And you shot Theo in the kneecaps. Both of them.”\n\nPaul groans and turns away. He slumps against the wall, facing it, both hands above his head like someone being put under arrest. “Did he die?”\n\n“No! No, the paramedics were sure he’d make it.”\n\n“So he’ll just lose one or both of his legs, then,” he says flatly. “Our Theo had to feel it too.”\n\n“Theo specifically told me not to blame you for that! You’re not the same man as the one who decided to work with your dad. I mean, how could you be?”\n\n“Theo’s a better person than I am,” Paul says. His mood is darkening; looking at him now is like watching storm clouds roll in to blot out the blue sky. “What then?”\n\nThis is even worse—but here, I’m the one to blame, not him. “I went back to the Russiaverse. I wanted to be in a world where you weren’t.”\n\n“I don’t blame you.”\n\n“It was just so I could think things through, someplace where I thought I’d be safe.”\n\nSensing my hesitation, Paul says, “What is it? Is the grand duchess all right? If her father found out about us—”\n\n“She’s kept the main secret.” I force myself to meet his eyes. “Paul, she’s pregnant.”\n\nHe whirls toward me then, almost angry. In one of those flashes of understanding that’s almost like telepathy, I know exactly why: His disbelief is so strong that he wants to think I’m joking, and he wants to hate me for making a joke that personal, that hurtful. Worse is seeing the truth sink in.\n\n“She’s having a baby?” Paul can hardly do more than whisper. “Because of me?”\n\n“Because of me. I’m the one who chose, remember? You were just—a shadow in Lieutenant Markov’s mind.”"

        "content": "“But what if I made the difference? If I pushed him over the brink of what he dreamed about, and what he would actually do?”\n\nI don’t have any comfort for him, not about this. The most terrible mistake I ever made was in someone else’s body, someone else’s life, and I can never, ever put it right. “We both know I’m the one to blame.”\n\n“Is she going to be all right?” Paul’s voice shakes, and I remember that he lived within Lieutenant Markov for nearly a month, loving the grand duchess as much as he loved me. It doesn’t make me jealous, exactly—only reminds me that I’m not the only Marguerite he’d sacrifice for. “She can’t hide that forever.”\n\nI walk to him and put my hands against his chest. He doesn’t respond, even as I say, “She wants the baby. Vladimir knows, and he’s taking care of everything.”\n\n“That’s our child,” Paul says. “Yours and mine.”\n\nI remember that faint goldfish-tickle, and the shivers that went through me as I felt Paul’s baby inside. “Yeah. It is.” I try to smile. “We managed to get pregnant before we slept together. That takes talent.”\n\nHe doesn’t laugh. He shouldn’t. Even having cracked that weak joke makes me feel cheap.\n\nSo I try to bring us back to the here and now. “Listen to me. We have to deal with the consequences of our actions, absolutely. I’m not even sure we can justify doing this.”\n\n“Doing what, exactly?” Paul says.\n\nI hadn’t known I would say this until the moment it comes from my mouth. “Traveling through dimensions at all.”\n\nHis eyes meet mine, and as surprised as he is, I think he might agree.\n\n“We shouldn’t stand around tearing ourselves up about it,” I say. “There are things we need to do as soon as we can. I want to take this treatment to Theo, to see if we can get him back in shape. And we need to talk with Mom and Dad about everything—what the Home Office is, how we might be able to communicate—”\n\nAnd about the Home Office’s plan to collapse as many universes as necessary until they get their Josie back. I need to tell Paul that, too. But not this moment. He looks weary and battered by what I’ve said so far. Wounded. The rest can wait until we get home. When we’re all together, able to make plans for defending ourselves, then he can bear it. Not yet.\n\nI reach up to put my arms around his neck, but Paul pushes me away, gently but firmly. “Marguerite—I’m sorry.”\n\n“For what?”\n\nHe stands there a long moment, the harsh light from his one cheap lamp painting his profile in stark lines and elongating his shadow on the wall. This place smells musty—unclean and sad. The pretty green campus and cozy town house seem to belong to another world altogether.\n\n“You’ve talked a lot about how the dimensions bring us together, time after time. You were the one who made me believe we belonged with each other in any world we could ever find.” Paul takes a deep breath. “I believed in destiny even before I fell for you. I saw it written in the equations. Woven into the fabric of the universe itself. But you helped me understand that we were part of destiny, you and me.”\n\n“That doesn’t mean we’re the same in every single world,” I say. “Yes, there’s something powerful that we share—and maybe that’s a soul. But we’re separate people, every time.”\n\nThis isn’t the game-changing revelation for him that it is for me. “I know. When I traveled, and got lost within the other Paul Markovs—I always sensed the differences. The ways they thought and spoke and dreamed that I never would, or could.”\n\nHe had told me this much before, but I didn’t truly understand until now.\n\nBy this point Paul looks wretched, like he’d rather be anywhere in the multiverse than here. Yet he still gazes at me with a love so strong I can almost physically feel it. “Don’t you see? We find ourselves in worlds so altered we can hardly understand them. When we’re people so different we can’t comprehend how we could ever be made of the same DNA. But so many times—so many—I only wind up hurting everyone around me. And more than anyone else, I hurt you. What if that’s our shared destiny? What if it’s not love but pain?”\n\nThat’s not the journey I’ve taken. Not the Paul I’ve seen. But I look at it through the lens of what I’ve just told him—imagining Theo bleeding in a New York alleyway, and the Grand Duchess Margarita pregnant and in hiding—\n\n“Hey.” I embrace him around his waist. His hands come to rest on my shoulders, though I can’t tell whether it’s a caress or a prelude to pushing me away again. “You don’t only hurt me. You help me, and you love me. You save me. Don’t forget that, because I never will.”\n\n“Look at the scar on your arm.”\n\n“That was just a stupid accident!”\n\n“Yes and no.” His expression clouds over. “I remember the things Paul said to you during that last fight, because he keeps thinking about it, over and over, replaying it like a loop inside his head. That day, it was like—like my father had taken over my body. Like his words were coming out of my mouth. All that anger he threw at me, I kept inside to throw at you. So yes, I’m to blame for what happened to you, and it could easily have been worse.”\n\n“Not you. Another Paul Markov did that, and I’m not worried about him.”\n\nPaul isn’t convinced. I can tell by the sadness in his eyes. But when he brushes his fingers through my hair, I take hope from his touch. He says, “You never know when to quit, do you?”\n\n“I’ll know when the time comes, but it hasn’t yet.” How can he be saying any of these things? After everything we’ve seen and done, how can he believe that he’s only destined to hurt me?\n\nBut then I remember—Paul has spent the past couple of weeks within this world’s version, who is mired in depression and guilt. That sadness lingers inside him; it’s not the kind of thing you can shake off easily. I never should have told him about the shooting or the grand duchess when he was in this state, because now he’s looking at me like it’s the last time.\n\n“Listen to me,” I say. “The multiverse is infinite. So, yeah, we go through some terrible things together, and I’ve seen versions of you who are darker, and damaged, and I don’t care. I want you even when you’re broken. I want you no matter what. Your darkness, your anger, whatever it is you fear inside yourself—it doesn’t matter. I love you completely, don’t you see? I even want the worst of you because it’s still a part of you.” I press one hand against his chest, as if I could send everything I feel straight into his heart. “I want you when it’s crazy, when it’s frightening, when it’s impossible, because there’s nothing within you that could hurt me half as much as not having you.”\n\nPaul struggles for composure; he won’t look me in the eyes. “Nothing could hurt me as much as hurting you, and that’s exactly what I’ve done. I’ve broken your body, attacked your friends, left you pregnant and alone. Don’t you see the pattern? Destiny is real, Marguerite. I have the equations to prove it, and now we’ve both lived it.”\n\n“Paul, no—”"

It didn’t matter to me; nothing mattered to me as long as you were safe. You could lead your life without me. If I have to give you up again, I will. It feels like—like cutting off your own arm—” His voice chokes off as he glances down at my exposed arm and the dark scar there.\n\nOnly then do I realize—Paul may not consciously remember the other versions of himself or the universes they inhabit. His subconscious, however, has been profoundly affected. He can’t see it yet, but I can. This fatalism—Paul’s belief that he could only hurt me—has been built like a wall between us, stone by stone.\n\nFather Paul in medieval Italy thought both God and the church would part us forever. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Markov of the Warverse had already pursued me in vain; he’d resigned himself to watching me love another. The Paul who wound up in the Russian mob? He’s bitter at twenty, surrounded by violence, nearly as much a prisoner as I was, tied up in that cellar. He only knew me as a victim—his victim. And now Paul dwells within the body of a version who lost everything that mattered to him: first the Firebird project, then his close relationship with my parents, then me.\n\nDid Conley do this on purpose? Or was it merely terrible luck? Either way, all the disappointment, anger, and misery of those four lifetimes has taken root within my Paul. He no longer believes in our destiny or in himself.\n\nThe past several days have taught me so much about the impact my actions have on the dimensions—and Marguerites—I visit. Now, in Paul’s sorrowful eyes, I see that they have an impact on us too. Maybe I’ve been protected as a “perfect traveler,” but Paul hasn’t. His splintering has exacted a terrible price.\n\nI’ve spent this entire journey trying to bring Paul back from these other universes. But as he stands here in front of me in this Cambridge flat, he feels farther from me than he has ever been.\n\nTalking Paul down from this bleak place will take time—not minutes, not hours, but days or weeks—and that’s time I don’t want to spend in this dimension. When we’re home, he’ll come back to himself. He has to. “Let’s go home, okay? Let’s just focus on Triad and go over this together. We only have so much time to work against Conley. That’s what matters most.”\n\nPaul nods. Having a concrete goal helps him steady himself. “Yeah. Let’s. But—you should head home first. If the other Paul and Marguerite woke up with you in his apartment—”\n\n“That would be bad. All right.” I can’t yet bring myself to step away, though. “You will follow me. You promise.”\n\n“Yes. I promise.”\n\nThen he pulls me close for a kiss.\n\nWhen our lips meet, Paul clutches me to him—like he never wants to let go. I open my mouth for him, lean into him. The night we planned to spend together, during my parents’ trip: I want Paul to understand that we’ll still have that, and so much else besides. When this is over, we’ll still have each other.\n\nI can tell he’s kissing me this desperately because he thinks it might be the last time. The way I’m kissing him should tell him it’s not. Not even close.\n\nTen thousand skies, and a million worlds, and it still wouldn’t be enough for me to share with you. Nothing less than forever will do.\n\nBy the time we pull apart, I’m shaky. Paul looks heartsick. He puts one hand over the Firebird on his chest. “I’ll see you soon.”\n\n“Okay,” I say as I head for the door.\n\nI refuse to say goodbye.\n\nAs I cycle back toward my family’s Cambridge home, I concentrate on the thoughts I need this Marguerite to remember best. She’ll be my messenger to this world, the world we need on our side most of all. We need to know how to communicate throughout the multiverse. That’s the only way we’ll ever be able to defeat Triad. And since Conley spied on this dimension once, he could come back eventually. If he does, and he sees you have this technology, you’ll be in even more trouble than we are. But don’t be scared. I swear, if we work together, we have a chance to win. To be safe from Triad forever.\n\nI know she’ll believe me; she won’t be able to help sensing that I’m telling her the truth. But what will these versions of Mom and Dad do? Will they stand with us, or tell us to stay the hell out?\n\nAs my bicycle glides into the driveway of our home, I bring it to a gentle stop. I already scraped one of her knees leaping into her dimension at the wrong moment; the least I can do is avoid scraping the other. I settle the kickstand, brace myself, and prepare to leap.\n\nOn impulse, I reach into my bag and pull out a compact. When I flip it open, I peer into the mirror—as close as I can ever come to looking this Marguerite in the face—and I say just one word, “Please.”\n\nAfter that, I snap the compact shut, drop it into my bag. Across town, even now, Paul is preparing to leap through the dimensions with me. It won’t be our last journey together. I have to believe that.\n\nI take the Firebird in hand and watch this world vanish, like watercolors rinsing away.\n\nReturning to my own body is always so much easier than any of the other jumps. Everywhere else the collision of selves jolts me in a way my parents haven’t been able to scientifically explain. But coming home? That’s as easy and effortless as slipping into a warm bath.\n\nI open my eyes to see Theo standing above me. Though his face is too pale, his eyes shadowed, he smiles as he says, “About time you got here.”\n\n“Good, you made it. How do you feel?”\n\nHe makes a face as he scratches the back of his head. “I’ve been better. But, hey, you got the juice, right? The data for the juice, I mean.”\n\n“Right. You’ll be feeling better in no time.” I rise from my bed and walk into the main area of the house in search of my parents. Theo must be as ready as I am to put them to work re-creating this solution. “Where are Mom and Dad?”\n\n“They were out when I got here. Probably at the university labs, trying to figure some other way out of this, or building another Firebird.”\n\nNo doubt. Well, they’ll be back by dinnertime, because they never eat on campus if they can help it. From the slant of the sunshine through the glass door to our deck, I can tell it’s midafternoon. “Have you checked to see if Paul has come back yet?”\n\n“You found him, huh?” Theo doesn’t high-five me, or celebrate in any obvious way. This is kind of odd—I’ve seen him do a victory dance just because he managed to flick a paper clip into his hat from across the room—but then I remember how weak he is. He’s back in this battered body, the one on the verge of failure. We don’t have any time to lose.\n\nA wave of powerful vertigo sweeps over me, making my stomach flip-flop as the whole world goes sparkly and dark. “Whoa,” I say, putting one hand to the side of my head. “What was that?”\n\nTheo puts one hand on my shoulder, only a touch. “You’ve been through a lot. No wonder you’re tired.”\n\nTired is not what I just felt. The Firebird has to have operated correctly; if it hadn’t, I wouldn’t be home now. Whatever this sensation is, it hasn’t left me. At least it’s not so strong that I can’t shake it off."

        "content": "“So Paul was going to come back at the exact same time as you?” Theo asks.\n\n“That’s what he said.” I know Paul wouldn’t break that promise, and yet I won’t feel totally reassured until I’ve spoken to him or seen him, here in our own world. Slowly I get to my feet, slightly dizzy but determined to keep going. “Where did I leave my phone? I want to call him.”\n\n“Don’t worry,” Theo says. He’s already looking on the rainbow table, which isn’t where I usually put my phone, but I guess it’s a place to start. “Take it easy. You’ll find him, Meg.”\n\nMeg.\n\nOnly one person has ever called me that—Theo.\n\nBut not my Theo.\n\nI turn to him, horrorstruck. From the way his smile hardens, I can tell he knows that I know who he really is. The Triadverse’s Theo has returned.\n\n“Was it the nickname?” he says. “I bet it was the nickname.”\n\n“Why are you here?” I demand. “Why did the Triadverse send you? Theo can’t take much more.”\n\n“He’ll have to,” Theo says, maddeningly calm. “Just like you.”\n\nThen he steps closer to me, and I see what he has in his hands: a syringe filled with emerald-green liquid. Nightthief.\n\nI jerk away from him, but he tackles me, slamming into my back so hard it hurts. Landing on the wooden floor knocks the wind out of me, and for a moment all I can do is try to breathe.\n\n“Sorry about that, Meg,” Theo says as he kneels over me, pinning me down. “But, you know. The ends justify the means.”\n\nI feel the needle sink into my arm.\n\nYou idiot, I want to say. Nightthief helps travelers take over their hosts. What is this supposed to do to me while I’m in my own body?\n\nMaybe he’s just poisoning me with the stuff—\n\nThen a shudder ripples through me. Overwhelming—paralyzing. I try to move my hand, but I can’t.\n\nI hear my voice come out of my mouth, speaking words that don’t belong to me. “About time,” I say.\n\nTheo’s smile has become more genuine. “Always a pleasure to meet anyone from the Home Office.”\n\nNo. But I know it’s true. The Marguerite who believes in Triad—who’s willing to kidnap, blackmail, or kill in order to make our dimension obey her own—she’s leaped into my world. Into my body. And because of the Nightthief, she’s in charge.\n\nShe has turned my skin and bones into my prison.\n\n“So,” Theo says. “What’s our first assignment?”\n\n“Figure out what they’re up to.” There is nothing more horrible than the feeling of glee within my captor. This Marguerite hasn’t just captured me; she’s enjoying it. “My parents aren’t the kind of people to surrender even if it’s the smart thing to do, in any universe. But once the versions here have been outsmarted a few times, sabotaged a few times more . . . well, we might be able to bring them in line yet.”\n\nTheo nods as he reaches down to help me—her—to her feet. “And if we don’t get them to work for our cause?”\n\nShe laughs. “Then it’s time for this dimension to die.”"

She wasn’t silent about her imaginary friend during her childhood, and is thus a bit of an outsider in her sleepy English town of Sorry-in-the-Vale. Still, Kami hasn’t suffered too much from not fitting in. She has a best friend, runs the school newspaper, and is only occasionally caught talking to herself. Her life is in order, just the way she likes it, despite the voice in her head.\n\nBut all that changes when the Lynburns return.\n\nThe Lynburn family has owned the spectacular and sinister manor that overlooks Sorry-in-the-Vale for centuries. The mysterious twin sisters who abandoned their ancestral home a generation ago are back, along with their teenage sons, Jared and Ash, one of whom is eerily familiar to Kami. Kami is not one to shy away from the unknown—in fact, she’s determined to find answers for all the questions Sorry-in-the-Vale is suddenly posing. Who is responsible for the bloody deeds in the depths of the woods? What is her own mother hiding? And now that her imaginary friend has become a real boy, does she still love him? Does she hate him? Can she trust him?",

Triệt tiêu ngay\n\n1\n\nRavens in the Kitchen\n\nTHE PIPE UNDER THE SINK WAS LEAKING AGAIN. IT WOULDN’T have been so bad, except that Nick kept his favorite sword under the sink.\n\nHe rescued it, wiped the steel, and absently tested the edge with his thumb while water flowed out onto the kitchen floor. Once he’d laid it aside, he realized the knees of his jeans were already soaked through.\n\nAlan brought Nick his toolbox.\n\n“Care to lend a hand?” Nick inquired without much hope.\n\n“No, I’m too busy cooking,” Alan said. “You do the heavy lifting around here. I’m more the sensitive intellectual type.”\n\nNick raised his eyebrows. “Oh, get in the kitchen and bake me a pie, woman.”\n\nHe peered into the cupboard again. The pipes made an ominous gurgling sound, and the bottom of the cupboard became the site of the world’s tiniest waterfall.\n\n“I can be a sensitive intellectual type as well,” he said at length. “If the other option is drowning under our sink.”\n\n“Save us all from a watery grave or cook your own dinner. It’s entirely up to you.”\n\nIt was a compelling point. Nick could cook his own dinner, but Alan actually worked at being a good cook. He made everything from scratch, and the sizzling sound of food hitting the pan and the sudden rich smell of frying vegetables made his argument for him.\n\nNick glared, which was effective when dealing with everyone but his brother. Then he took the knife out of his wrist sheath, laying it carefully alongside his sword, rolled up his sleeves, and got to work.\n\nAside from the sink, this house was pretty good. It was small, the color of cardboard that had been left out in the rain, and exactly like every other house standing in the military lines of the housing estate. Still, each house was separated from its neighbors by a decent distance. There was nobody complaining about strange noises in the night. That was worth any amount of leaks.\n\nOn the whole, Nick liked Exeter. There was a statue on the high street that reminded him of a knife, and he was learning to map the city out from that point. It was rare for them to stay in one place long enough for the landmarks to become familiar, but they had been here two months with no danger signs yet. They both had jobs, he was just about getting by at school, and Alan had even had time to find a new crush.\n\nHe would be sorry when they had to leave.\n\nThe pipe gave a long metallic groan, like an ancient robot about to fall to pieces, and Nick gritted his teeth and twisted the wrench hard. It was too old to be properly fixed; all he could do was try and hold it together until it could become the next tenant’s problem.\n\n“Someday we’re going to live in St. Leonard’s and get away from all this.”\n\n“Oh, sure,” said Alan easily. The chili was simmering and he was leaning beside the sink, arms crossed over his thin chest, watching Nick work. “When I win the lottery. Or when we start selling your body to rich old ladies.”\n\n“If we start selling my body to rich old ladies now,” Nick said, “can I quit school?”\n\n“No,” Alan answered with a sidelong smile, warm as a whispered secret. “You’ll be glad you finished school one day. Aristotle said education is bitter, but its fruits are sweet.”\n\nNick rolled his eyes. “Aristotle can bite me.”\n\nOver their heads the floorboards creaked in a sudden, sharp sound, like boughs breaking. Nick looked up on reflex, but he knew what it was: It was Mum, pacing the floor in one of her bad spells. By the sound of it she was just getting started, and Alan would spend all his time up there with her.\n\nAlan must have noticed Nick’s glance at the ceiling, because for some idiotic Alan reason he reached out with the obvious intention of ruffling Nick’s hair. Nick shied away.\n\nAlan sighed, then Nick heard him reach for the radio instead, the small click as it went on, and the music that poured out and drowned the sound of Mum restlessly moving in the rooms above. Alan limped over to a cupboard and began to ru&rdd beganmmage around for something, singing softly under his breath. Nick ducked back in under the sink and let the sweet sound rush over him, let his mind relax while his hands were busy with practical work. Dinner smelled almost ready. Maybe his stupid brother would sit down and eat his own food before he saw to Mum, and maybe this would be an okay Thursday after all.\n\nThere was only an instant’s warning.\n\nThe talisman Nick wore always hurt him. It was a constant irritation, an anchor hung around his neck that hummed and stung, but now pain flooded through him like an electric shock with the talisman as its source. The bird bones built around the talisman, woven into a web of crystal and net, shifted to form a new pattern. It felt as if the new pattern were being slowly burned into his skin.\n\n“Alan,” he ground out between his teeth.\n\nThen the window exploded inward, a sharp burst of glittering shards caught in the fluorescent lights. Nick dropped the wrench and shielded his face with his arm, turning and glancing under his sodden sleeve to check that Alan had already hit the floor.\n\nIn through the window came an unkindness of ravens.\n\nTheir enormous iridescent wings were crammed against each other, the kitchen suddenly packed with feathers and the birds’ deep, hoarse cries. The air of the room seemed to be nothing but the wind caused by their wing beats, and they sounded hungry.\n\nNick crawled along the floor until he could grab his sword. The hilt was slick against his wet palms, and he hefted it in one hand and reached out with the other to grab Alan by the scruff of his neck and drag his brother behind him.\n\nAlan lifted his shirt and took his gun out of its holster.\n\n“Don’t pick me up. You’re my little brother, and it’s shameful.”\n\n“You’re a beanpole, and it’s too easy,” Nick returned, watching the birds carefully. They were starting to settle on the kitchen surfaces, the curves of their folded wings hunched forward like shoulders, apparently watching him back. “I can’t believe you’re still using that stupid gun.”\n\n“I like my gun,” Alan protested.\n\n“They don’t always work!”\n\n“Well,” Alan conceded, “that’s why I’ve got three knives on me.”\n\nThere were ravens between them and the door. Nick hefted his sword and swung, feeling a rush of fierce joy when the blow connected and cut deep. One raven fell to the ground with its chest bleeding, and the rest screamed and wheeled on them. Nick hit the floor again, rolling toward the wall with one arm over his head. Alan was beside him, and Nick figured that he could be more or less shielded between the wall and Nick’s body.\n\nThey stayed down, panting, and Nick tried to think through the blood pounding in his temples. These birds were obviously under the control of a demon, and there would be a magician watching to make sure the demon did its job.\n\nDemons almost never possessed animals. They hated being trapped in bodies with such limited brains. Nick wondered how many human bodies the magicians had offered this one in return for the favor.\n\n“You get the magician,” Alan whispered. “I’ll take the demon.”\n\n“I’ll get them both,” Nick said roughly, and shoved Alan for emphasis. “You stay down.”\n\nNick rose and for a moment felt like he was out in the night and in a storm, except that the storm was made of feathers. He had to throw up his left arm to beat away two ravens that went for his eyes. The talons of one bird scored burning lines down his cheek, and Nick knocked it away, forgot all about strategy, and brought the sword around in a brutal circle through feathers and flesh.\n\nThis time none of the ravens screamed. Four more descended on Nick, their talons sinking into his sword arm, and cloth and skin came away in strips. When Nick tried to shake them off, more skin tore away, and when he lifted his face so he could see what he was swinging at, a bird hurtled down toward him. Its curved beak was aimed directly at his eyes.\n\nHe got a sharp elbow in the back from his idiot brother, pushing him to one side. He recovered his balance, then spun and cut two birds down, sending the other three in mad, croaking flight to the ceiling.\n\nBy the time Nick turned back to his brother, Alan was already advancing, and Nick saw he had the leader in his sights. He went to Alan’s side with his sword at the ready, in case the gun didn’t work. Alan’s eyes narrowed behind his glasses. He took aim and fired.\n\nHe didn’t miss. At this range, the demon didn’t have a chance.\n\nThe body of the raven went down, and the demon that had been possessing it went up through the ceiling, its body an insubstantial black plume, rising like glittering smoke.\n\nNow that birds were not trying to claw Nick’s eyes out, it was easy enough to spot the illusion. He was good at spotting magic. He’d tried to explain to Alan once that illusions were sharper, more real than the real world, more real than they had to be, but Alan had never been able to see it.\n\nThere was one bird now that was not milling about frantically like the others, but making directly for the broken window.\n\nNick pointed. “There!”\n\nAlan fired again, and where a bird had been was a man falling.\n\nAs the body fell to the ground, the door leading to the hall opened and Mum stood in the doorway, her magicians’ charms shining with power, her hair falling like shadows over her face.\n\nAlan was checking the man’s pulse, so Nick was the one who looked over at her and said, “It’s dealt with. We don’t need you.”\n\nMum stood in the darkened hallway, watching him with pale eyes, and said at last, “I didn’t come for you.”\n\nShe closed the door, and Nick heard her slowly climbing back up the stairs.\n\nThey both looked around, panting a little, in case there were any more surprises to follow. But after five minutes nothing else happened. Nick let his sword point drop and touch the floor.\n\nIt was over. They were left with about fifteen confused ravens, a dead magician on their kitchen floor, and the sound of their mother’s footsteps fading away.\n\nWhile Alan salvaged dinner, Nick leaned against the kitchen counter and tried to keep out of the birds’ way. They might no longer be under the sway of a demon, but they were still animals with great big go-to-hell beaks and claws, and Nick had never really been much of an animal person. Animals could tell, too. Alan’d had a cat once, and he’d had to give it away after it bit Nick a few times.\n\nThey didn’t have to discuss it: This meant moving. Great. Nick had only just got Alan’s bookshelves up the way he liked them.\n\nThe cuts along his cheek and arm stung. Nick fingered the gash on his cheek and tried to judge how deep it might be.\n\n“Don’t touch that,” Alan said, slapping his hand away without looking at him. “It’ll get infected. Dinner’s done, I think — let me patch you up and then we can eat. We’ll clean up afterward.”\n\nNick saw Alan shiver. The night air was blowing in cold. At least some of the birds were noticing the enormous space where the window used to be. A few had already left.\n\nHis cheek hurt, and he was starving. Nick fingered his talisman and scowled.\n\n“Jump up,” Alan said, sweeping broken glass out of the way with his sleeve pulled down over his hand. Thank God the saucepan lid had been on their dinner.\n\nNick rolled his eyes and slid into a sitting position on the counter. Alan got down the first-aid kit, tilted Nick’s chin up, and started to pour the disinfectant carefully into the wounds. Alan always tried too hard to be gentle, which made everything worse. Nick set his teeth.\n\n“Am I hurting you?”\n\n“No,” Nick said. “That was the stupid birds.”\n\n“They’re very intelligent, actually,” Alan told him as if he was under the impression Nick cared at all. He squinted and pinched the lips of the wound, taping them together. Then he set to work on Nick’s arm. “If you catch them young, you can teach them to talk.”\n\n“I don’t see what the big deal about that is,” Nick said. “I can talk.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nBí mật detox gan và tế bào hóa ra lại cực kì đơn giản và tiện lợi\nTấp nập người mua chiếc đồng hồ bản sao Omega này khi nó giảm 90%\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

Anyway, I think a raven might’ve been easier—”\n\nThere was a noise outside.\n\nNick placed his hand over Alan’s mouth, cutting off all that fond reminiscing nonsense, and slid off the kitchen counter. He pushed Alan aside, put a finger to his lips, and bent to scoop up his sword in one swift motion.\n\nThen he walked quietly to the back door. Alan could not follow him. Alan was not very good at stealth, because of his leg, but Nick glanced behind him before he nudged the door open with his sword point. Alan had drawn his gun.\n\nThe door swung all the way open, and there was a sharp movement in the darkness. Nick lunged.\n\n“Don’t hurt her!” yelped a boy’s voice, and Nick caught himself just as Alan flipped a switch and light flooded the little garden.\n\nNick stopped with his sword poised against a girl’s throat.\n\nShe and her friend had obviously been hiding under the kitchen window. Chances were good they’d seen everything.\n\nTo her credit, the girl did not draw back from the blade. She did not even flinch. She just looked at Nick, her dark eyes large and calm in the sudden light, and Nick realized how all this must seem to her: the window frame with only jagged edges of glass left in it, the ravens winging through the air around them, the dead body on the floor. The boy with the sword to her throat.\n\nAll she did was swallow very gently against the blade and say, “I heard this was the place to come if you had a problem that was…out of the ordinary.”\n\nShe looked familiar.\n\n“Obviously that wasn’t true,” said the boy standing at her shoulder, taking a nervous step away and then back to her. “Obviously this is the place to come if you want to get murdered by lunatics. Um — we’re sorry to have bothered you! Is there any chance we could just leave?”\n\nThere was something a whole lot more familiar about his voice, which was light but wavered at crucial points where it was meant to be lightest and airiest. He was standing in the girl’s shadow, but the light caught his earring.\n\nNick recognized that before he recognized the boy’s worried face, the spiky blond hair that the darkness had turned into a pale crown.\n\n“Wait,” Nick said.\n\n“O-okay. Is there any chance we could get off with a flesh wound?”\n\nNick shifted his stance so he could look back at Alan, and saw the girl brace herself and the boy grasp her shoulder, fingers going white. Alan was standing in the doorway with his gun drawn.\n\n“I know this guy,” Nick said. “He’s harmless.”\n\n“Sure?” Alan asked, squinting behind his glasses.\n\n“Sure,” Nick said. “James Crawford. Trust me, if he was a magician, he’d be able to defend himself at school. He’s harmless. He’s useless.”\n\n“He’s not—” the girl began furiously.\n\n“Let’s not argue with the crazy person holding the enormous sword!” James Crawford said. “And — did you say school?” He stepped away from the girl to look at Nick properly. “Oh my God, Nick Ryves.”\n\nNick still hadn’t lowered his sword. He was a little bit intrigued by the fact that the girl hadn’t moved away either. She was still looking up at him, still determinedly calm.\n\nHe knew her now. She was the weird girl in the class above him, who dyed her hair pink and always wore a lot of pentagrams and crystals. Right now she was also wearing giant chandelier earrings and a violently pink T-shirt that bore the words ROMEO AND JULIET WOULDN’T HAVE LASTED.\n\nHe avoided people like her. He avoided anyone who tried to be noticed. That had been one of Dad’s first lessons: Try to act just like everyone else. If you failed to blend in, the magicians would find you.\n\n“You know him?” she asked James.\n\n“Well, yes,” said James. “He hangs around with a pretty rough crowd at school, Seb McFarlane and that lot, but they’re smoking-behind-the-bike-shed rough. This is different, there were gunshots. My life was going to flash before my eyes, but it decided to hide behind my eyes and quake with terror instead. I think we should just go.”\n\n“I’m not going anywhere,” the girl said. “I saw that bird turn into a man! You saw it too, Jamie. You must have.”\n\n“I don’t know what I saw. It could’ve been a hallucination. You get those from sniffing glue.”\n\n“You’ve never sniffed glue!”\n\n“I’ve smelled glue,” Jamie said after a pause. “In art class.”\n\nNick was about to tell them exactly what he thought of their babbling and exactly what he would do to them if they didn’t go away at once and never breathe a word of what they’d seen, when Alan moved from the doorway into the light.\n\n“Mae?” he said, his voice incredulous, and then quickly, “Nick, put that sword down!”\n\nMae said, “Bookshop Guy?”\n\nNick looked at her, tilting his head and recalling Alan’s wistful speeches on the subject of the pink-haired girl who liked the Beat generation. He put two and two together and came up with the fact that this entire situation was ridiculous.\n\nThis was Alan’s latest crush, then.\n\nNick drew the sword slowly away from the girl’s throat and lowered it until the tip almost but not quite touched the ground, holding himself ready just in case. He let his gaze follow the blade, toward the ground and away from Mae.\n\n“Whatever you want,” he said softly.\n\nJamie was staring at Alan. “You helped me find Catcher in the Rye today and now you shoot people?”\n\n“He only shot one person,” Nick remarked. “But the night is young.”\n\nAlan glanced at him reproachfully, then turned back to Jamie and smiled his slow smile. He’d tucked the gun away under his buttoned-up shirt, along with his talisman, and all trace of the boy who fired to kill and never missed was gone.\n\nThe smile spread just a little bit at a time, coaxing and sweet, persuading Jamie to smile with him. Jamie was wearing a shy, crooked grin before Alan was done.\n\n“Forgive him, he has no manners.”\n\n“I get by on good looks,” Nick said.\n\n“I know all of this is pretty strange,” Alan continued, “but you came here for a reason, didn’t you?”\n\n“We came here because — something really strange has been happening to Jamie,” said Mae, her voice hard. “I was expecting someone who could give us real occult help, though, not a guy who works in my bookshop and a school thug younger than I am. I wasn’t expecting birds that turned into men and weapons and weird necklaces. I don’t know what the hell is going on!”\n\n“If you’re so disappointed,” Nick said, “get lost. We’re busy.”\n\nThe evening was getting colder and colder, as was Nick’s dinner, and he had to board up the window and call the garage to tell them he was quitting. He did not care what these people wanted, or what was going on with them, or why anyone would use the word occult when they didn’t have to.\n\nHe just wanted them to go away.\n\n“No, no,” Alan said at once. “I know all this must look strange, but we can help you. We want to help you.”\n\nNick felt himself bound to correct this misapprehension. “I don’t. And we’ve talked about this, Alan. Don’t you think we have enough going on without opening up a charity shop for people who think they need occult”—he let his lip curl—“help?”\n\n“Dad would have wanted us to help people,” Alan told him, and then addressed the others. “Look, please come in. I can explain everything.”\n\nIt was a testament to Alan’s powers of persuasion that they did not laugh in his face. It was a testament to Alan’s powers of looking nonthreatening that he could manage it with the door open on their destroyed kitchen, with a corpse on the floor. He rumpled his red hair and adjusted his glasses in an anxious sort of way, and he took a couple of steps back to the kitchen. He let them see the limp: He used that, the same way he used everything.\n\nMae and Jamie visibly relaxed.\n\nNick gave up, shaking his head and following his brother inside. Mae squared her shoulders resolutely and crossed the threshold into their home. Nick was standing in the doorway and stepped back about an inch, so she had to brush by him. She looked irritated and uncomfortable doing it, and he smirked at her. He saw her hesitate, as if she was about to turn and run, but Alan stood before her looking honest and inviting.\n\nShe stopped, reached up, and tapped the talisman lying against Nick’s chest.\n\n“What’s this?” she asked, her voice a little softer.\n\n“It’s a talisman,” Alan answered gently. “It warns him when magic is being used nearby, and it protects him from smaller spells.”\n\n“Protects him,” Mae repeated. “So you’re talking about black magic, then? The kind that hurts people — that causes trouble.”\n\nNick laughed, looking at the broken glass and black feathers around them.\n\n“There isn’t any other kind.”\n\n“I have a feeling this is going to be one hell of an explanation,” Mae said, and walked into the kitchen and toward Alan.\n\nJamie still looked wide-eyed and extremely doubtful about what he was doing, but he dashed in after her.\n\nNick closed the door and found himself wondering what had brought this pair to their house. You had to be desperate to come to them.\n\n2\n\nDemon’s Mark\n\nOF COURSE NICK WAS EXPECTED TO GET RID OF THE BODY.\n\nHe always did it, since Alan couldn’t be expected to haul corpses about the place with his leg, but he seldom found it this irritating. He could’ve had his dinner first, if Alan hadn’t been worried about what the guests would think.\n\nHe twisted the steering wheel more viciously than he should have, since making sharp turns in the narrow roads around Exeter was not exactly advisable.\n\nHis foul mood might have something to do with the fact that these two freaks were from his school. People from his school had seen the way he lived, with the sword and the gun and with ravens and demons. It didn’t seem to bother Alan, but it should have. There were a lot of things about their life that should have bothered Alan.\n\nHe drove along the river Exe for a while, the low-lying city lost behind the car, the faint shapes of buildings in the distance looking like no more than the shadows of a larger city he could not see. He waited until there had been nobody else on the road for ten minutes, then pulled the car over to the side of the road and climbed out.\n\nNick bundled the body out of the boot. The man had been tall, he noticed idly, and he wondered if he should check his sigil to see what Circle he belonged to.\n\nHe decided not to. Anyone could come by while he was doing it, and besides, it didn’t matter which Circle had found them this time. All the Circles were after them. It would be a different one next time.\n\nThe presence of sigils on the bodies was good for only one thing. It meant that the Circle would check for the tattoos and take back their own, and the police would not come to Alan and Nick’s asking questions about discovered bodies and shots fired.\n\nAll the same, it was usually a good idea to remove the corpse from their actual property.\n\nNick looked into the man’s slack face. It was also a good idea to get the body into running water as soon as possible. Otherwise the Circle might give their fallen comrade to the demons. A demon could use a dead body for a few days.\n\nThe body was easy enough to haul up onto the parapet, and Nick balanced it there for a moment, looking down at the river. The waters were black and quiet before he dropped the man into them, hoisting the flopping legs over the side as he went. The body hit the water with a splash, sinking almost entirely under, dragged down by the weight of a heavy leather coat and innumerable charms and talismans. Nick watched a pale hand bob at the surface, buffeted by the current so it looked alive.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCứu lấy lá gan của bạn khỏi ung thư với mẹo này!

He hoped that their uninvited guests would be gone by the time he reached home. It shouldn’t take long for Alan to tell them that there were magicians in the world who could call up demons and set them on people. That there were quite a lot of other things happening side by side with the normal world those idiots pretended they didn’t fit into. They had probably just heard the warnings Alan had spread and convinced themselves they needed “occult help.” wop.&rdqu\n\nChances were, after all, that whatever problem the pair had was imaginary. He turned the engine on. It roared to life, and he pulled away fast from the side of the river where the body was sinking.\n\nImaginary problems. Must be nice.\n\nBy the time Nick had turned the curve past St. David’s station, he was sure Alan was already finishing the usual spiel. He told everyone who came all they needed to know to protect themselves. If Alan had been less eager to help people and more concerned about protecting himself, Nick would’ve felt better.\n\nNick could almost hear Alan’s voice now.\n\nThere are demons living in another world, he would say, a world side by side with ours, and they are hungry.\n\nThey are hungry for the sounds and sights and sensations of our world. None of them can get in, though. None of them can touch you, unless a magicians’ circle builds a bridge for the demons. Stay safe. Stay away from the magicians. Stay away from us.\n\nWorked for Nick.\n\nHe parked the car, jumped out, and came in angling the door so he could see everything, his sword half-drawn, as he usually did.\n\nAlan’s voice drifted to him through the open door. “So, Mae — is that because your birthday’s in May? Because it’s almost May now….”\n\nAlan had changed the usual spiel a bit, Nick noticed.\n\nHe pushed the door all the way open and slid his sword all the way out of its scabbard. This pair had invaded his house. He could scare them if he liked.\n\n“It’s not May like the month,” Mae explained. “It’s Mae like Mae West.”\n\n“Like you wish,” said Nick.\n\nAt the same time, his brother glowed and asked, “Are you a movie buff?”\n\nThe sitting room was brightly lit and conspicuous for its ordinariness, unlike their kitchen full of broken glass and dead birds. Alan had obviously made everyone a cup of tea, and he and Mae were sitting in the two big, broken-down armchairs. Jamie was perched on the end of their sofa, his tea untouched, as if he did not trust it. Alan was leaning slightly toward Mae, and she twisted her head at the sound of Nick’s voice and looked toward the door.\n\nNick observed the flicker of appreciation in her brown eyes. He wasn’t particularly surprised. She was just the type to like them tall, dark, and carrying a lethal weapon.\n\nHe let his lip curl. That kind of behavior was so stupid, he couldn’t bear it.\n\n“You lot still here?” he asked. “When’s dinner?”\n\n“We have a serious problem,” Mae told him, now looking angry rather than appreciative.\n\nNick came in, idly swinging his sword, and took a seat on the other end of the sofa. “I’m sorry to hear that,” he said. “And I’m still hungry.”\n\n“I’m sorry about him,” Alan put in, glaring. “He gets cranky.”\n\nNick raised his eyebrows. “I’m only cranky when I’m not fed.”\n\n“So he’s — he’s cranky?” Jamie repeated. “Cranky, and — and he carries a great big sword. Well, that’s marvelous, that is.”\n\nAlan laughed, and Jamie relaxed again. Alan had a knack for that. Parents, bosses, animals, and children, they all liked Alan.\n\nGirls liked Nick. He felt it was a fair trade.\n\nNick realized that since Jamie was in his class at school, chances were that they were the same age, but Nick had always looked and felt older than all the kids at school, and Jamie was small and wide-eyed: made to be his teacher’s pet and his classmates’ target.\n\nHe probably would’ve been less of a target if he hadn’t insisted on wearing lavender shirts and jewelry to school.\n\nNick didn’t blame Jamie for being nervous around him. Lots of people were, and besides that, Seb McFarlane and his lot were always hassling Jamie, and they were technically Nick’s friends.\n\nNick thought the kid was stupid for sticking his neck out when he didn’t have to and couldn’t protect himself, but he’d never laid a finger on him. It was a waste of energy; Jamie had never done anything to him, and Alan would have been furious.\n\nHe understood anger, though, the restless urge to lash out at anyone that made that little group of bored boys tick. Nick always gravitated to those boys, the troublemakers in every school. The other kids avoided Nick, as if they could smell the violence on him. It didn’t bother Nick; he could smell the weakness on them. These boys thought every danger sign was a show of strength. They weren’t afraid of him, and he needed a group. A boy alone got too much attention.\n\n“So,” Jamie said, apparently now under the impression that he was welcome, “you two live together?”\n\nHe jumped a little when he saw the expression on Nick’s face, then edged so far down the sofa he was practically sitting on the arm.\n\n“Yes,” Nick responded, in a voice of ice. “Because he is my brother.”\n\n“Ah,” Jamie said faintly.\n\n“Don’t take that tone with my brother,” Mae said, tilting her chin. “How was Jamie supposed to know? You two don’t look anything alike.”\n\nNick looked away from her and Jamie, to the mirror over the mantelpiece. It only reflected the lamp against the wall, the light a low sunset color inside the ugly orange lampshade. His grip on his sword tightened.\n\nHe didn’t need her to tell him. He knew that.\n\nMae and Jamie were not much alike, as siblings went. She was on the curvy side, and Jamie was a skinny wretch Nick could have snapped like a twig in one hand. Jamie was blond, and Nick suspected that under the pink Mae was a basic brunette, but they both had the same big brown eyes, the same heart-shaped face. They shared a few markers of kinship with each other, the small signs of shared blood that Nick would have wanted to share with Alan, and not with her.\n\nAlan looked uncomfortable. Nick cleared his throat, and Jamie jumped again, as if the sound was a gunshot. “Alan looks like Dad. I look like Mum.”\n\nIt was as simple as that. He fixed both of them with a stare that dared them to ask further questions or make further personal observations. His family was none of their business.\n\nNeither Mae nor Jamie spoke. Alan, however, could never be stopped from talking by any power of God or Nick.\n\n“Now that Nick’s back, why don’t you tell us why you’re here and what you think might be wrong,” he said, still smiling. His eyes creased up behind his glasses when he smiled, until they were nothing but gleams of vivid blue.\n\nIt was Dad’s smile, and Alan used it to the same effect Dad always had.\n\nMae was apparently not immune to the smile. Her face softened and her back straightened as she smiled back.\n\n“Well,” she said. “I’m psychic myself, you see.”\n\nNick snorted. “Oh, of course you are.”\n\nMae looked offended. “It’s possible that I’ve grown out of it, but very strange things happened around me when I was younger. Little objects used to smash by themselves, or fly through the air. I didn’t know what was going on, but I’ve researched and I’ve looked for people who might know something, and I’ve heard things about magicians and the demons who give them power. And it’s true, isn’t it? That man you — he’d turned himself into a bird! He was a real magician. It’s all real.”\n\nSounded like some of the Market people had been talking. Nick wished they could learn to keep their mouths shut, or at least learn not to take advantage of Alan’s soft heart, and stop sending the problem cases his way.\n\n“It’s real,” Alan said, “but I don’t think—”\n\nHe looked worried about distressing the lady, so Nick came to his rescue. He leaned forward, looked at Mae, and said, “Let me put things simply so you will understand them. You’re not a magician. You’re an idiot. A few people in this world are born with a certain amount of magic, but they don’t grow out of it. They either learn to control it and keep it a secret forever, or they try to do something with the magic. Which means that most of them become magicians and call up demons. It’s the safest and easiest way to get more power, but there’re also rituals with the dead, and—”\n\n“Rituals with the dead,” Jamie repeated in a faint, stunned voice. Nick turned and looked at him coldly. “I mean,” Jamie said, and swallowed, “how interesting and not at all creepy! Please go on!”\n\nNick was tired of this. They’d been attacked, they were going to move again, and he didn’t need these people witnessing what a mess his life was. He hated it that they were from his school: that Jamie had seen him trying to read, and now they were getting an illicit peek into his weird world. Afterward they’d go home, safe and warm, and they would think that they’d had an adventure.\n\nHe leaned forward and caught Mae’s eyes again, giving her the kind of look that made most people flinch.\n\n“There are the magicians’ messengers, and people who can enchant others with music, and people who can make magical objects,” he explained, his voice low. “But funnily enough, there are no people who grow out of having magical powers. If you had them, you’d know about it. But you don’t know anything, and none of this concerns you. Go home and stop bothering me for no reason.”\n\nMae did flinch and immediately looked furious with herself. “I have a reason!”\n\nNick was ready to snap back at her when Alan leaned forward and touched his arm. His grip on his sword tightened, but he fell silent, and Alan said in a much kinder voice than any Nick could’ve achieved, “What’s your reason?”\n\nMae looked at the floor and said, “I told you. It’s Jamie.”\n\n“It’s crazy, is what it is,” said Jamie. Nick turned to look at him again. Jamie did not seem overjoyed to have captured his attention. He swallowed and made a face, as if someone was forcing something bitter down his throat, and then continued, “It all started with — these dreams. I thought they were just dreams, strange dreams, of someone beautiful outside my window, asking to be let in.”\n\n“A succubus,” Mae put in helpfully. Nick raised his eyebrows at the word and made sure she saw him do so. She frowned at him and continued, “Or an incubus, that’s the word for the men, isn’t it? I’ve read about them, they’re demons who come in the night and basically have their wicked way with you.”\n\n“Their wicked way?” Nick repeated. “My, my. What kind of books have you been reading, and does your mother know?”\n\nMae glared, and Jamie’s face went scarlet. So did Alan’s. Apparently he’d never heard that there was such a thing as being too sympathetic.\n\n“What happened?” Alan asked quietly.\n\nJamie looked up from the floor and found something in Alan’s eyes that made him square his shoulders and say, in a steadier voice, “I let him in. And then, in the morning, it was real. I mean, someone had really been there. There was—”\n\n“All you need to do is answer the question,” Nick interrupted. “We don’t need details.”\n\nMae’s glare intensified, and Nick smiled, feeling pleased and vicious at once. These people shouldn’t have come here. School and home should not overlap. Nick was meant to be normal at school, and this was his place, his brother, his home, even his mad mother rocking upstairs. He did not care about their problems. He only wanted them to leave.\n\nHe leaned forward to say something else.\n\n“Nick,” Alan said, and Nick reluctantly closed his mouth. Alan nodded at Jamie to go on.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nThoát khỏi cánh cửa tử thần của ung thư gan nhanh chóng!\nCách thải độc gan do rượu bia “chuẩn” cho dịp tết này"

When I told Mae, she started asking some people questions.”\n\n“When I was asking about magic, I started hanging out with people who have unusual interests,” said Mae. “There isn’t much of a Goth or Wicca scene in Exeter, but I went to a few places I know and asked around. A lot of people wouldn’t talk to me because the Goths think I’m a bit of a baby bat, and the Wiccans think I’m a playgan.”\n\n“People think you’re — a bat,” Nick said slowly. “Well, of course. Many people think I’m a blueberry scone.”\n\nShe grinned a sudden, unexpected grin, and he almost smiled back at her, but then he recalled that she was invading his home and looked right through her until her smile melted away.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of her stayed put.\n\n“It means they think I’m just playing around and not serious,” she continued in an even cooler tone. “Some of them listened to me, though, and there was one guy — a stranger — who told me that if I had a weird problem, I should come here.”\n\n“Considerate of him,” Nick murmured.\n\nHe was icily furious. Forget the black arts, any magician could find them by asking a few questions down at the local, because the Goblin Market felt the need to spread the word. They said that it was their responsibility to protect normal people from the magicians. Nick thought it was their responsibility to remember that the magicians could be listening anywhere, at any time, and careless words could get them all killed.\n\nNick gave Alan a dark look, but Alan was not looking at him. His gaze was fixed on Mae.\n\n“Was it an incubus?” Mae asked. Nick snorted.\n\nAlan said, “There’s no such thing as an incubus. Not exactly. There are just demons, and demons will take any shape and offer anything to get what they want.”\n\nA question broke from Jamie. “What did he want?”\n\nNick shifted his sword, laying it flat against his knees, and smiled when Mae’s and Jamie’s gazes were caught by the gleam and slid along the blade.\n\n“He wanted what all demons want,” Nick said softly. “He wanted to come in out of the cold.”\n\n“The demons live in another world,” Alan explained. “All the writings I’ve been able to get my hands on stress how different the worlds are. There are old legends that say humans were made of earth and demons of fire. It’s a metaphor, of course, but it’s a good one. They are made of entirely different materials from us. There is no description of the demon world available in the books. Maybe it can’t be described, but apparently it is so bleak that the demons are willing to do anything to leave it, even for a short time — and that is where the magicians come in.”\n\nMae reached over and took Jamie’s hand, lacing their fingers together. Jamie held on tight.\n\n“There are magicians after Jamie?”\n\n“Oh, sure,” said Nick. “After him. Or you. Magicians aren’t fussy. You’re all just meat to throw to the demons.”\n\n“You’re not helping!” Mae exclaimed.\n\nNick leaned back against the sofa, crossing his legs and balancing the sword against one knee. He bared his teeth at her.\n\n“I am helping. I’m telling you the truth. You don’t like it, that’s your problem.”\n\n“Meat,” Jamie repeated, his voice trembling. “What does that mean?”\n\n“Demons can only enter this world if they are summoned,” Alan answered. “The magicians summon them, so they can use the demons’ power as their own. You have to understand — people don’t ever have much magic of their own, but demons can control the elements. They can create illusions so real you can touch them. And they’re willing to give some of their power to the magicians, because they want entry into this world.” He looked at Jamie, his eyes wide and serious. “There must be magicians close by who called up a demon and let him go hunting for a body to possess. And you must be older than you look.”\n\n“I’m — I’m sixteen,” Jamie said. “I was sixteen in October. What does that matter?”\n\nHe was almost six months older than Nick, then. Nick found that mildly amusing, since Jamie came up to his shoulder.\n\nThen he remembered his birthday last month. Alan had made a cake and told him to make a wish, and he’d done it because ridiculous things like that made Alan happy. He’d closed his eyes and wished for a long time here in Exeter, safe and undisturbed.\n\nNick scowled. Look how well that had worked out for him.\n\n“Demons won’t go after anyone younger than sixteen, not if they have a choice,” Alan explained. “They don’t like being in the bodies of animals or children. The brains aren’t developed enough to have proper control over their magic.”\n\n“Children aren’t like animals,” said Mae, frowning.\n\n“Demons aren’t PC,” Nick said. “Imagine that.”\n\nAlan reached out and touched the back of Jamie’s hand. Alan was a great one for touching people.\n\n“You don’t need to worry,” he said. “If you have a mark, we’ll bring you to the next Goblin Market and get it taken off. Mae has her talisman, and I can get you one as well. The demons will move on to easier prey.”\n\nJamie shifted on the sofa, as if he was not sure which way to move. Nick had become familiar with that kind of reaction. People were always upset to hear someone like Alan casually saying things like “easier prey.”\n\n“I always thought that Mae talking about magic was sort of…silly,” he said, with an apologetic grimace at his sister. “The first time I found a mark, I didn’t even tell her, but—”\n\nNick’s sword point hit the carpet at the same time as he seized Jamie’s arm and yanked him to his feet. Jamie twisted in his grip for a startled instant, and then froze when he saw the look on Nick’s face.\n\n“Exactly how many marks do you have?” Nick snarled.\n\n“Let my brother go,” said Mae, who’d stood up at some point. Nick did not bother looking at her.\n\nHe caught another movement out of the corner of his eye, though, and did look. It was Alan, getting up with a great deal more difficulty than Mae had. Alan was never more obviously crippled than when he had to climb to his feet. He had to use the back of t\n\nSeeing it never did anything to improve Nick’s mood.\n\n“Nick. Take it easy. Put the sword down.”\n\n“Yes!” Jamie said, arm trembling in Nick’s grasp. Nick could break it now, if he liked. “Yes, that’s an excellent idea. Why don’t you put the sword down?”\n\nMae hovered at Alan’s elbow, looking defiant but clearly unwilling to do anything that might put her brother at risk. Alan reached out and took hold of Nick’s wrist, his grip gentle but firm.\n\nNick let go of Jamie’s arm. He backed up a step, laid his sword carefully on the living room table, and stepped away from that as well. He swept his sword arm wide to display the vast emptiness of his hand, and then he looked expectantly at Jamie.\n\n“Now,” he said. “Show me.”\n\nJamie swallowed and glanced nervously at his sister.\n\n“It’s all right,” Alan told him. “Nobody’s going to hurt you.”\n\nThere was a pause in which Jamie carefully did not look at Nick, though Nick was waiting with his arms folded, promises in his eyes of what he’d do if this boy had endangered his family.\n\nSlowly Jamie undid the buttons of his shirt, starting from the bottom. He fumbled with the buttons, fingers dragging as if weighed down by everyone’s stares, and then stopped when the shirt was halfway undone. His chest looked like any boy’s chest, any boy who didn’t eat or exercise enough. Pale, thin, and then high on his left hip, just above his jeans, there was…\n\nNick swore. “A third-tier mark. You came to us with a third-tier mark.”\n\n“What does that mean?” Jamie asked in an agitated voice, which climbed higher with every word. “How many tiers are there? What d’you mean, tiers, like — tiers on a wedding cake?”\n\nThe windows of the sitting room showed nothing but blackness, but that was the problem with night. The demons could be on you before you had a chance to prepare yourself, and now there was a boy with a third-tier mark in Nick’s house. He glanced at Alan, and Alan looked so sorry. Alan was obviously trying to think of a way to tell the boy kindly, but with news like this it didn’t matter how you said it.\n\nBesides, this was nothing to do with them. Except that the boy had brought it into their home.\n\nNick went and sat on the table beside his sword. He reached out and pointed, his finger tracing the air an inch from the mark on Jamie’s skin. The mark looked red at first, but after a moment looking at it your vision would blur, as if the mark was trying to slip out of sight. Even though the heart of the wound was red, the torn edges were black as shadows, black as blood in the night. There were two lines cut in Jamie’s skin, and within the two lines were three ragged puncture marks in the shape of a triangle.\n\nWithin the lines and the triangle, scarlet and shiny as a burn, was an open, staring eye.\n\n“Three tiers,” he said curtly. “The first tier is the two slashes. They form the doorway. Once it’s made, the demons are aware there’s a weak spot, hira weak and they start to gather at the door between the worlds. They can track you once that first mark is made. Second tier is the triangle. Three equilateral points — three equilateral punctures — and once they’re made it means that someone has to die.”\n\nMae abruptly sat. She had been standing right behind Jamie, hovering protectively, and then suddenly she wasn’t. She had fallen backward into an armchair, her face white and her fingers gripping the arms of the chair.\n\n“Die?” Jamie echoed.\n\n“Someone has to die,” Alan repeated. “Either you or a magician: one of the magicians’ Circle that summoned the demon. Their blood could be used to wipe the second mark away.”\n\n“That doesn’t matter,” Nick interrupted. “Because you have a third-tier mark. Inside the door, inside the triangle, is the eye. That’s the third tier. Once you have that, they have a fix on you. Eventually they will be able to break down the barriers in your mind, crawl inside you, and control everything you do. The demons are watching you now, and nobody but you will do.”\n\n“Wait,” said Jamie, his voice trembling, his whole body trembling. “You can’t mean that. I thought the two slashes were just tiny cuts. I thought the triangle of puncture wounds were insect bites or something. I didn’t even tell Mae until there was a burn mark that looked like an eye. I didn’t even know if we should come here tonight, and now you’re saying that it’s too late already?”\n\nNick shrugged. “Yeah.”\n\nHe stopped pointing and clasped his hands loosely together, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. Jamie was just standing there, shirt crumpled and half-open, hands hanging empty and open at his sides. Both he and his sister were wearing blank, blind looks, as if the universe had been rearranged in front of their eyes and the new version hurt too much to look at properly.\n\nIt was the look on Alan’s face that unsettled Nick. He was obviously feeling something, something softer and more than pity, something that came naturally to Alan and that should probably come naturally to Nick. He felt somewhat at a loss. The doomed ones always upset Alan.\n\n“There has to be something,” Mae protested, her voice on a hard edge between rage and fear. “There has to be something I can do, you can’t just tell us that there’s nothing—”\n\n“I’m sorry,” Alan said. “I would help if I could.”\n\n“Why would the demon just want him to—” Mae checked herself, clearly unable to say the word.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐã tìm ra lối thoát cho người xơ gan!

It will tear his body apart. It always does: The demon can’t make it last. And they won’t give a body up.”\n\n“First he’ll be a demon,” Nick said. “Then he’ll die. Shouldn’t take more than a month.”\n\nJamie appeared to be on the verge of hyperventilating, to judge from his breathing. Nick did not look at him. There was nothing he or Alan could do, no matter how much Alan wants such Alaed to help. They had told them what was going on, and that it was bad. He didn’t know what these two expected.\n\nIt was because he was looking at the carpet that he saw it first.\n\nCreeping from the small unused hearth, over the worn red rug, and spilling onto the carpet, came pale, almost invisible tendrils of mist.\n\n“Mist inside,” Nick reported sharply.\n\nTwo attacks in one day, and a boy wearing the demon’s eye in their house. They were certainly getting a lot of attention.\n\n“Out of striking range,” Alan ordered the others. “Get onto the chairs. Get your feet off the floor.”\n\n“Striking range,” Jamie repeated, clambering onto the sofa even as he spoke, holding fast to the back. He was still trembling. “It’s mist. Does mist generally strike in this house? Is it attack mist?”\n\nNick picked up his sword and prowled around the circumference of the rug, hefting the hilt a little against his palm as the mist spread across the floor. You could hardly see it, and then the slow creep caught your eye, the wavering of the air at the edges of the room, and you realized the room was brimming with mist.\n\nMae had got up on a chair, but she was twisting where she stood to get a better view. “Mist,” she said. “Is it a vampire?”\n\n“No, woman, it’s not a vampire,” Nick said scornfully. “It’s another stupid illusion from stupid magicians who think we’ll be too distracted by their first attack to notice it.”\n\nHe scanned the room from edge to edge, looking for the most likely sign of movement, holding his sword ready. The thin film of mist made the carpet blur a little before his eyes, everywhere he looked.\n\n“Mist is a small magic,” Alan explained. “It usually resolves into a small animal that a demon’s possessing. Mist’s easy enough to deal with.”\n\nThe usual form the mist took was a rat. Once, though, Nick had been forced to try and stab a large spider. He hoped it would be something big this time; he could use some action. Thursday night had been ruined, his house had been invaded, but he could be calm about this. All he had to do was kill.\n\nThe two amateurs were up on the chairs, moving and making a racket. Alan, who knew better, stood perfectly still and never distracted Nick by stirring or speaking at all. Nick stalked around the perimeter of the room. He caught the shimmer of mist gathering and forming a shape the instant before it happened.\n\nHe would’ve had it, but he was not expecting something as long and twisty as a snake. There was just the mist and then suddenly it was there, a thin black stripe against the carpet, moving faster than Nick did, striking faster than Nick did. Nick was only a second behind it.\n\nHe sprang forward and brought the sword down hard.\n\nHe cut the snake in two bloody halves an instant after it had sunk its fangs into Alan’s leg.\n\nFor a moment he was not worried at all. Then he saw the expression on Alan’s face, and he remembered his brother saying, Mae has her talisman, and I can get you one as well.\n\nNick had not thought to wonder where Mae had got hers. He had not noticed the absence of the telltale bulge under Alan’s shirt.\n\n“You’re wearing it,” Nick breathed, turning his eyes to Mae.\n\nShe put her hand to her throat, silent for once. She was smart to stay quiet. There was blood pounding in Nick’s ears. There was blood sliding down his sword. Alan knelt, quite calmly, and rolled up the leg of his jeans. Nick saw the mark, saw two red lines just above his ankle, saw the doorway of the demons on his brother.\n\nThis had never happened before.\n\n“Nick, calm down,” Alan said, his own voice unacceptably calm. “It’s only a first-tier mark. We’ll take care of it. We’ll go to the Goblin Market and have it removed.”\n\nNick’s arm ached with the effort of not swinging his sword, not bringing it down anywhere, on anyone. His whole body felt run by cold rage, as if rage was flowing in his veins and the chill was stinging him into action.\n\n“Shut up!” He wheeled on Mae and Jamie. “Get out,” he suggested. “Or get hurt. It’s your choice.”\n\nHis teeth ached, he was gritting them so hard, and Mae and Jamie scrambled away from him over the furniture. He had to lower the sword then, because the only target left was Alan.\n\nNick drew in a deep breath and threw his sword against the wall. It struck plaster with the ring of steel, and he shut his eyes at the sound.\n\n“You gave your talisman away,” he said, hunting for words. He didn’t want to speak, but he had to; he could do nothing else, because what he wanted to do was hit Alan.\n\nHe paced, desperate and silent as an animal. Finally he found words, and threw them at his brother.\n\n“I can’t believe you were so stupid. Not again!”\n\n3\n\nThe Hidden Girl\n\nNICK REMEMBERED THE FIRST TIME THE MAGICIANS HAD caught them.\n\nHe had always known they were there, a hunting presence like the sound of trumpets and dogs in the undergrowth must be for foxes, but that time was different. It was the difference between knowing they were there and having the dogs upon you, jaws snapping, with no chance to run.\n\nNick had been eight years old, and Alan eleven. Nothing had seemed serious then. Mum had always been strange, had never liked Nick, but it was Dad’s job to take care of Mum, just like it was Alan’s job to take care of Nick.\n\nThere had been a lot of moving, but always to houses that were warm, places with gardens and lots of room. Nick had never worried where his next meal was coming from, and never worried that someone might try to kill them. Nick had known the magicians were hunting them, and Dad had made sure they knew how to fight. It was just that Nick never really believed thoul„e magicians could get past Dad.\n\nDad could do anything. He could calm Mum in her wildest fits, and he could reassure anyone who ever got suspicious. He looked just like Alan except big, an enormously adult and comforting presence who could carry a tired boy anytime they had to move in the middle of the night. Nick remembered those midnight moves only as moments when he stirred to find his cheek pillowed against Dad’s broad shoulder.\n\n“You’re mine,” Dad used to say. “And I’m going to take care of you.”\n\nBack then wearing the talisman had just been a precaution, like Alan holding his hand when they crossed the road. Nick hated the talisman.\n\nA talisman looked a lot like a dream catcher decorated with bones, which had crystals in the place of beads and salt and spells poured over the weave when they were made. Dad used to buy them both talismans at a stall in the Goblin Market, like a normal father buying his sons toffee apples. Wearing a great big dream catcher struck his eight-year-old self as stupid, and besides that it was uncomfortable.\n\nIt was always moving, always burning. It left a faint silvery scar on his chest where it usually rested. Nick understood what that meant now. He took after his mother. He wasn’t happy about it.\n\nAt the time it was simply a nuisance. Nick was forever leaving it on his bedside table or by the sink in the bathroom, and Alan was forever finding it and bothering him to keep it on.\n\nThe talisman was in the backseat of the car on the night Dad carried Nick right into a trap.\n\nThe magicians had got there first. They had laid a circle around the family’s new house that flared into the three points of a triangle once they’d all passed the threshold. Three equilateral points, like the Bermuda Triangle. The sign for death.\n\nDad had put Nick carefully down as they all looked at each other and knew what this meant. To break the circle would mean death. They were caught as neatly as animals in a snare, with no chance to run, and the magicians would be able to come and collect them without a fight.\n\nDad had not made a fuss at all. Nick had watched uncomprehendingly as his father walked across the floor and knelt down in front of Alan.\n\n“You’ll look after your mother and your brother. You’ll do whatever you have to do. Swear to me.”\n\nAlan whispered, “I swear.”\n\n“That’s my boy,” Dad had said, and kissed Alan once, on the forehead. He took him by the shoulders and looked at him for another moment, and then he rose to his feet and ran at the circle.\n\nHis family stood and watched him burn as he crossed the magicians’ line, collapsing in on himself like a hot coal stabbed by a poker. There was nothing left of him after a moment but ashes and emptiness.\n\nDad was the one who gave them a chance to run, but Alan was the one who got them out. He grabbed Mum’s hand and asked Nick if he had his talisman. Nick remembered exactly how he had felt in that moment: empty of all words, hardly able to understand Alan’s question. He’d shaken his head, and Alan had paused and then tugged the talisman over his own head.\n\n“Take mine.”\n\nThe magicians were lying in wait. Their demons were ready. The air had been thick with them: attacking birds, ice underfoot, licks of flame like whips leaping at them from empty air. Fire passed right through Mum’s wild black hair, and she sobbed and clutched at her talisman in gratitude.\n\nFire hit Alan’s leg and he cried out; he had to lean on Nick to get to the car, and tears had poured down his cheeks as he told Mum what to do and where to drive. They drove to Scotland, not even pausing to sleep, and it was not until days later that Alan decided it was safe to go to a hospital. By then infection had set in, and the muscles were damaged.\n\nNick never took his stupid talisman off again, no matter how uncomfortable it was.\n\nIt was only Alan and Nick from then on. Mum hardly counted.\n\nIt had been eight years. They had been running ever since, hardly able to keep themselves fed, hardly able to escape when they were cornered. It had been eight years and Alan, that idiot, had not learned that he should never give away his talisman again.\n\nAlan fled upstairs to Mum the instant Mae and Jamie were gone, mumbling something about feeding her and meaning that he was a complete coward. Nick couldn’t follow Alan up to Mum. She’d be upset for days if Nick actually went into her room. When she had her bad days, she needed the security of knowing that if she stayed in her room, she wouldn’t have to see him.\n\nThey had some time to move out, at least. The magicians had lost one of their number and must have used up a lot of power with those ravens and the mist so soon afterward. Still, Nick knew he should stay inside tonight, stay close just in case of another attack.\n\nInstead he went out and did exercises. He had to practice long hours with the sword, making sure he could move as if it were another, somewhat sharper limb — and besides, the kind of mood he was in, he was almost hoping the magicians would attack him. Let them try.\n\nThe night wind swept cool along his bare arms as he lunged and feinted, trying to stab shadows through the heart. The few teachers he’d had told him it was all about the moves, but Nick always had to imagine an opponent: someone he could hurt and whom he wanted to hurt badly. In order to really practice, he had to make a more deadly enemy than he’d ever faced out of the air. He had to be better than anyone he could imagine.\n\nEspecially since his stupid crippled brother was apparently determined to throw his life away.\n\nNick fought the air and thought about the night Dad had died. He only headed back to the house when it was past four in the morning, shrugging his shirt back on as he went. The material was chilled and damp from lying on the grass, wet with a night’s dewfall, and it stuck to his sweat-slick skin.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐã tìm ra lối thoát cho người xơ gan!

I never told you. I’m sorry.”\n\nNick laid his sword down on the draining board with a metallic clink.\n\n“Why did you do it?”\n\n“Well, Nicholas, she was over sixty. I thought you’d be a little disturbed.”\n\nNick said nothing. He stared at Alan, jaw set, and let silence stretch from him to his brother as if it was a red carpet he was unrolling for Alan to talk on.\n\n“Look, they needed help and we were the only ones who could give it,” Alan said rapidly. “I can buy another talisman from the Market people tomorrow. I thought I’d just give Mae mine and replace it—”\n\n“Stop lying to me.”\n\nThe scrape of the spatula in the pan faltered. Nick crossed his arms over his chest and waited.\n\n“I don’t know what you m—”\n\n“It was the boy who had the problem. You gave the girl the talisman. Don’t try to pretend that you didn’t want to give her something. Don’t pretend you didn’t want to impress her with how magically attentive to her needs you could be.”\n\nThe tips of Alan’s ears were violently red.\n\n“Maybe you’re right,” he admitted.\n\n“I’m right.”\n\nAlan hesitated, then set his thin shoulders. “I wanted to impress her, but I wanted to help them too. The talisman will protect her. If I wanted her to — to like me as well, what does it matter?”\n\nAlan looked tired in the remorseless yellow light of the kitchen. He should be asleep, not up frying eggs and worrying.\n\n“I don’t see why it matters if she likes you or not.”\n\nGirls were an old subject of argument between them. Alan sighed, and Nick stared out the window, where the shadows of night were paling slightly, preparing for dawn.\n\n“Don’t — I know you’re worried,” Alan said. “Don’t be. How many people with first marks have we seen? How many first marks have you removed? How is this different?”\n\nNick turned his gaze from the window to Alan.\n\n“This is different,” he said. “This is you.”\n\nAlan looked terribly pleased for a moment, and Nick realized that his brother had taken this as one of the ridiculous, sappy things Alan was used to saying all the time. Nick had only meant what he’d said. It had never been his brother before.\n\nThankfully Alan did not make a fuss about it. He could believe Nick had said any stupid thing he wanted, so long as there were no scenes.\n\nAll he said was, “Here, have your dinfast. Then we can start packing.”\n\n“Dinfast,” Nick repeated.\n\n“Dinner and breakfast!” Alan said triumphantly. “Like brunch.”\n\nNick subjected him to a long, judgmental stare. “There’s something very wrong with you,” he said at last. “I thought you should know.”\n\nUndaunted or perhaps just unsurprised by this news, Alan began to do the dishes. He pushed Nick’s sword away with sudsy fingers to make room for a wet frying pan.\n\n“Where do you fancy living next?”\n\n“London,” said Nick, because he thought that Alan would like it.\n\nAlan looked pleased, and he saw he’d guessed right.\n\n“London, then. We’ll find a better house, one with a kitchen window that’s not all smashed, and we’ll go to the museums. Then come May we can go to the Goblin Market and find someone to dance—”\n\n“I’ll dance,” Nick said.\n\nThe comfortable clink and splash of the washing-up stopped. Alan had gone rather still.\n\n“You don’t have to. Someone else can do it. You told me you never wanted to dance again.”\n\nFor all that Alan was so fond of talking, for all that he could bang on endlessly about nothing for hours, he didn’t actually seem to understand words. Nick had said everything quite clearly. He had never intended to go into the circle again, never intended to dance for the demons again. As far as he was concerned, the marked ones could go to someone else for help.\n\nOnly this time the marked one was Alan, and it was different.\n\n“I’ll dance,” he repeated. Alan smiled his embarrassing touched smile, and Nick rolled his eyes. “I’m not going to any museums, though.”\n\nIt was late when Nick woke, full sunlight pressing against the restraining curtains. He only woke when he did because of a noise below that sounded ominously like someone dropping every one of their pots and pans.\n\nNick found a clean shirt with all due haste, and came down the stairs still buttoning his jeans.\n\n“Give me that,” he ordered.\n\n“Oh, but young sir, the doctor said I could go back to heavy lifting if I was real careful of my poor old heart,” Alan croaked.\n\nNick forcibly removed the box of cooking equipment from his brother’s thin arms. “Go pack up your books.”\n\nIt was a luxury to have time to move out of a house. Whenever Alan had to leave his books behind he got wistful, and when they moved in a hurry they always had to spend their first paycheck on plates and blankets instead of the heating bill. Nick liked the peace of physical exertion, being useful and not having to think; liked the heft of big boxes in his arms and the sun on the back of his neck as he pushed the final box into the car boot. The air felt like it had rained sometime this morning, and the sky was washed a lighter shade of blue than normal. Nick turned back to the house, cracking his neck, and let one thought form in his mind: They were going to London, and they might have at least a couple of months before all the freakish madness caught up with them.\n\nNo sooner had he thought this than a thunder of feet on the tarmac behind him made him spin, going for the knife sheath in the small of his back.\n\nFramed against the pale sky, rushing toward him in a flurry of open flannel shirts and the chiming of about four necklaces apiece, came the odd couple from last night.\n\nNick let go of his knife, though not without a moment’s reluctance, and fixed them with a cold look that was usually effective. They did not run in the opposite direction, but Nick leaned his forearms on the roof of the car and maintained a baleful gaze, just in case they decided to reconsider.\n\nMae’s eyes scanned the filled car and Nick’s disheveled appearance, and realization swept over her face. “You’re running away!”\n\n“You’re an investigative genius,” Nick said.\n\nShe scowled at him, small face twisted into an incongruous expression of fury. It struck Nick as funny that this short, pink-haired girl would obviously have loved to be tall and imposing and have her fury strike fear into people’s hearts.\n\n“What about us?” she demanded. “We don’t have anyone else to help us!”\n\n“So? I don’t care.”\n\nMae seemed momentarily floored, her righteous outrage lost in uncertainty. She glanced at Jamie, who was standing about doing his impression (Nick had to concede it was good) of a wounded deer. She reached out a hand to clasp his shoulder.\n\n“You know what’s going to happen to Jamie,” she said in a low voice, scraping on her pain. “How can you just leave us?”\n\n“Why shouldn’t I? People die all over the world, and I doubt you lose sleep over them. What’s so special about you? Why should I want to help you? You two invaded my home and got my brother marked!”\n\nNick set his teeth lightly into his lip. He’d come close to raising his voice. His arms were tensed, his hands clenched with the longing to reach for a knife or a sword, his insides knotted with the urge for action. He wished sometimes that he could feel angry without feeling the urge to kill, but he never had.\n\nIt was different for Alan. He’d asked his brother once what he felt when he was angry since Alan never wanted to kill people — though sometimes he had to — and Alan had looked upset and described feeling indignation and annoyance and a hundred things all at once that he said added up to anger.\n\nAlan was too soft. All Nick felt was the violent desire to cut down whoever was in his way.\n\n“Come on, Mae,” Jamie said, his quiet voice a shock. “I told you he’d be too angry to help us. We’ll find some other way.” He glanced at Nick, eyes sliding apprehensively from him to the safer sight of the car. “I’m sorry about your brother. We didn’t mean for him to get hurt.”\n\n“Doesn’t matter what you meant,” Nick pointed out.\n\nHe’d be on edge until Alan’s mark was gone. He didn’t need these people bothering him as well.\n\nJamie reached up to take his sister’s hand that rested on his shoulder, twining her fingers around his and trying to use it to tug her away. He backed up a step and then stopped, like a boat caught short at the end of its rope. Mae stood firm, her eyes boring into Nick.\n\n“Get lost,” Nick said, enunciating each word as if she was a bit slow. “There’s no help for you here.”\n\nThat was when Alan came outside, blinking slightly in the bright light. His quickly checked smile at the sight of Mae made Nick feel unwell.\n\n“Hi, Alan,” Jamie said in a small voice. “Are you feeling okay?”\n\n“Yes, of course. There’s no need to worry about me, I’ll be right as rain in no time,” Alan assured him, smile fading as he looked at Jamie. This was just how Alan had looked at the sick kitten he’d taken home so it could grow up big and strong and able to bite Nick.\n\nJamie offered him a little smile as if to call Alan’s back. “You’ll get it fixed at the — Goblin Market thing.”\n\nMae and Jamie’s faces suddenly changed, as if a shadow had fallen over them. Nick turned to see that shadow was actually Mum’s dark form at Alan’s shoulder, moving slowly forward until the cold light touched her face.\n\nMum walked past Alan, her hand lingering on his sleeve for an instant as she went by. Her black flag of hair streamed behind her as she went, as if it wanted to cling to the shadows. When she stopped in the middle of the yard, her hair fell with a weighted swish like heavy curtains around her face. Nick kept his eyes turned to her so he would not have to look at Mae and Jamie. It was always the same, the way people’s eyes moved from Mum’s face to Nick’s, while their expressions moved from recognition to silent horror.\n\nNick’s mother had a face that kept all secrets but one. Her broad, slanted cheekbones made her look catlike, and her wide mouth was constantly moving and always formed a shape at odds with her expression. She was tall, and her black hair made her look even paler than she was. She looked like Mae might have wanted to look, if Mum had not looked insane. The full mouth kept shifting with the spasms of a tic. Past the protection of hooded eyelids that seemed pulled down by heavy lashes, her eyes were icy blue and seemed always fixed on someone who was not there.\n\nExcept for the color of his eyes, Nick looked exactly like her. He hated it when people saw her. They could never look at Nick again without associating him with madness.\n\n“We’re leaving again,” she said flatly. “I don’t know why we bother. He’ll find us.”\n\nNick wished he could look away from her. He wished that he could leave her. He wished that Alan would agree to leave her.\n\nMum smiled dreamily, the rest of her face frozen and expressionless. She said, “He’s not the kind of man who fails.”\n\nAlan limped forward to stand beside her in the uncut grass of their front yard, and reached for her hand. Nick didn’t see how he could bear to touch her. “Olivia,” said Alan, voice low, “don’t. Let’s get in the car.”\n\nShe turned and pressed her fingers against the curve of his cheek, gazing at him but not quite meeting his eyes.\n\n“You’re a sweet boy,” she whispered. “You’re my sweet boy, but you’ve got it all wrong.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐã tìm ra lối thoát cho người xơ gan!

The movement almost drew Nick’s eyes to the tangle of talismans and chains around his mother’s neck, but he stopped his instinctive glance. These two knew enough about his family already. They didn’t need to see him looking at Mum’s charms.\n\nHe looked at Alan instead, expecting to find steadiness there, expecting sanity and familiarity.\n\nHe saw fear.\n\nHe saw Alan draw his gun out in the open, out in their front garden where anyone could see. Nick didn’t hesitate. He drew his sword and held that sharp, glittering barrier between his brother and the rest of the world, and then he looked around to see what was threatening them.\n\nShe was coming down the road toward them, her high heels clicking on the cement. She looked to be in her forties, with a sleek brown bob and large earrings that caught the sun, shining perfect circles with a knife in the center of each one.\n\nThe knives danced jauntily in their circles as she turned and smiled at them.\n\n“Hello, boys. How are you today?”\n\nNick strode toward her, Alan a pace behind him. He wheeled behind the woman, and after a moment Alan came to stand in front of her. She swung around, briefly teetering on her heels, unable to keep them both in her range of vision and unsure who to focus on.\n\nNick claimed her full attention by stepping in to her as if they were about to dance. She stopped, facing him, then looked down to see that he was holding each end of his sword and pressing the length of the blade lightly against her stomach. He gazed down at her and smiled a little.\n\n“All the better for seeing you.”\n\nThere were as many types of magic user in this world as there were colors in white light. On one end of the spectrum were the magicians, and on the other end was the Goblin Market.\n\nThere were a lot of people who wanted more power than the Market offered, and who didn’t quite have the stomach for feeding their own kind to demons. There were the necromancers and the messengers, the pied pipers and the soul tasters, and a dozen others, and Market people trusted none of them.\n\nThey trusted the messengers least of all. Every messenger wore the sign of a knife through a circle. It was a sign from the magicians. It meant that the messenger was attached to a Circle of magicians, and if you crossed the messenger, you crossed the Circle.\n\nThe knife more or less indicated how things would go from there.\n\nMessengers were closely associated with magicians. They carried information back and forth between Circles, and between magicians and the outside world, and in return they were paid with demons’ magic. Magic bought in blood.\n\nAs far as Nick was concerned, they were magicians without the guts.\n\nOver the messenger’s shoulder he saw Mae and Jamie, looking alarmed by the sudden appearance of weapons and a stranger. He saw Mum standing by the car, her face a complete blank.\n\nThe messenger smiled, a small, wary smile like a concerned parent watching her child. She looked far more like a mother than Mum. Possibly Nick should hire her for his next parent-teacher meeting.\n\n“You’re looking very grown-up, Nick.”\n\n“It’s true, I’m entering on manhood,” Nick said. “You’re a stylish, sophisticated, ever so slightly evil woman of the world. Do you think we could make it work?”\n\nShe looked much less like a mother when her smile went sharp like that. “Probably not.”\n\nNick adjusted his grip on the sword, held it at the precise point where her ribs ended. “Pity.”\n\nAlan interrupted, his face grave and his gun at the small of her back. “What’s your message?”\n\n“Oh yes,” said the messenger. “That.”\n\nShe twisted lightly around, ending up with Nick’s sword against her spine and Alan’s gun against her stomach. Nick met Alan’s eyes over her shoulder and watched for any signal.\n\nThe messenger’s voice was calm. “Black Arthur says that now’s the time. He wants it back.”\n\nIn the silence there was a small, sharp sound. Alan had released the safety catch.\n\nNick could only see the back of her head, but the messenger sounded like she was smiling. “You can give it to me now, or Black Arthur can come and take it.”\n\nThere was very little in Nick’s life that stayed around long enough to be familiar. There had been a statue in one place, a building in another, but taking his whole life into account, Alan’s face was the only reliable landmark he had.\n\nHe had never seen Alan look like this before.\n\n“Let me ask you this,” Alan said, his voice dangerous and shaky at once, like a knife held in a trembling hand. “What d’you think would be the best message to send Black Arthur? Maybe I should let you go back and tell him that he can come and try? He’s been chasing us for years. What makes him think he can catch us now?”\n\nThe woman tilted her face toward Alan’s, as if they were going to kiss.\n\n“He’s serious now,” she murmured, sounding as if she was about to laugh. “Hadn’t you noticed, Alan? We did send you a sign.”\n\nAlan went perfectly, terribly white.\n\nThe demon’s mark. Nick heard his own voice saying, They can track you once that first mark is made.\n\n“Sweet Alan, so devoted, so much trouble. We won’t be chasing after you blind now, will we? Wherever your little family goes, you’ll lead us right to them.”\n\nNick could see the gun shaking in Alan’s hand now, in tight, terrified spasms. “Last night we put a magician in the river,” Alan said, his voice low and intense as if he was making a promise. “Maybe we should send you to join him.”\n\n“You know the rules,” the woman whispered. “Don’t shoot the messenger.”\n\nNick interrupted, leaning down to speak in her ear. “Do they say, ‘Don’t cut the messenger in half with your great big sword’?”\n\nAlan’s eyes narrowed. He stepped back and said, “Let her go, Nick.”\n\nNick stepped back too, but he did not sheathe his sword. He held it ready, just in case, and the sun danced along the steel and turned it into a dazzling line of light. He could barely see the messenger’ Cssee, s small, polite smile.\n\n“What shall I tell Black Arthur?” she asked.\n\nEven Alan’s lips were white. “Tell Black Arthur that no matter what I have to do, I’ll make him regret sending that message,” he said. “Now go.”\n\nThe messenger looked from Alan’s white face to Nick’s dark smile, and went. She turned sharply on her heels, balance perfect again, and walked away. Her step was measured and unhurried, her head held high, as if she were walking away from a successful board meeting.\n\nAlan looked as if he was going to collapse or kill somebody.\n\nThe two strangers in their world were staring at his pale face and the gun still in his hand. Nick looked at Alan’s eyes, sheathed his sword, and strode toward the intruders. Jamie flinched as he came.\n\n“If you’ll excuse us,” he said, his voice on the edge of a snarl. “We’ve just had some bad news.”\n\nMae did not back down a step. Under other circumstances that might have impressed him, but just now all he wanted to do was get his brother away from the curious stares of strangers and take that look off his face, and her stubbornness simply infuriated him.\n\n“Who’s Black Arthur?” she asked.\n\n“None of your business,” Nick barked.\n\n“It is my business,” Mae snapped. “It sounds like he’s the person you’re running from, and once you’re gone, who will be left to help Jamie?”\n\nHer voice trembled on Jamie’s name, and of course that made Alan look up, soft touch that he was. His face was still a nasty gray-white color, but he looked a little more like himself.\n\n“Mae,” he said, and his voice was kind again, “I told you. There’s nothing any of us can do to help Jamie. I’m sorry.”\n\nMae surprised Nick again. Instead of bursting into loud fury, her mouth worked for a trembling terrible moment, and he thought she was going to cry. “I’d take his place,” she said, her voice rough. “Can I do that? Is there a way?”\n\nThe second surprise was Jamie, speaking in a tone of command. “I wouldn’t let you!”\n\n“It doesn’t matter,” Nick told them. “There’s no way.”\n\nHe wanted fiercely to be on the road, to leave Exeter and everyone in it behind them.\n\n“If I could help you, I would,” Alan said helplessly, as he had last night. “I swear I would.”\n\nMae’s eyes narrowed, reminding Nick of a woman at a stall, trying to make a shrewd bargain. “You’re going to the Goblin Market to get help. Can’t we go there too?”\n\n“No,” said Nick.\n\nAlan hesitated. “I don’t think anyone there can help you.”\n\nMae pushed her advantage. “There might be someone, though. There might be some way you don’t know about. It’s a chance, isn’t it? Please, Alan. Please let us come.”\n\nThere was a long moment where Mae stared at Alan, and Nick stared at his clenched fists.\n\n“All right,” Alan agreed at last. “If”—and a note of bashfulness crept into his businesslike voice—“if you’ll give me your number, I can — I’ll call you. Once I find out where the Market is being held next month.”\n\nCompared to the demon mark and the early move, compared to the magician’s message, seeing Alan embarrassing himself over yet another girl should not have mattered.\n\nIt did, though. It was so pointless, they were leaving, but Alan could still stand with their crazy mother in the yard and their crazy life packed up in their car, all of it in plain sight, and hope.\n\n“So you’re getting your way,” Nick said, hearing his voice slice through the silence, like the sword he’d wanted to use on that woman. He was furious and he wanted someone to pay, he wanted to hurt someone, and Mae was there. It wasn’t fair, but what was? “I’d hate to disappoint you,” he went on. “What else did you want to know? Oh yes, Black Arthur.”\n\nHe threw the name like a missile at his mother, standing in the middle of the garden with her black hair blowing around her face. She had not moved since the messenger appeared, and her expression had not changed. She had simply watched the whole thing, watched Alan, like a ghost watching something that could not possibly concern her.\n\nAs he bore down on her, her expression did change. Her lip curled.\n\n“It’s a romantic story, really,” he said harshly, staring down at her. “He was the man our mother loved. She was one of his magicians, and she fed people to the demons on his orders. He drove her mad, and drove her into Dad’s arms. She ran from Black Arthur bearing a powerful charm, and since then every magician in England has been hunting us for it.”\n\nHe grabbed a fistful of the chains around her neck, and she turned her face away. They had been like this for as long as Nick could remember. He could not forgive her for the lives they had led, for Dad’s death. He could not forget the look on Alan’s face, and that was her fault as well.\n\nHe leaned toward his mother and whispered, “And now it seems that he wants it back.”\n\nWhich wouldn’t have been a problem, except that if someone took away the charm, Mum would die.\n\nNick’d had his moments of thinking even that wouldn’t be so terrible. She had been a magician, after all. If she was gone, he and Alan could have normal lives. If anyone at the Goblin Market had known the truth about her, they would have said she deserved death.\n\nThis was not one of those moments. If the thought of her dying made Alan look like that, she had to live.\n\nNick stood with his mother’s chains, heavy and cold, in his hands. They were both breathing hard.\n\nWhen Alan spoke, he sounded tired. “The Goblin Market will be held on the first of May. Will I give you two a call?”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nViêm xơ gan có thể dẫn đến ung thư! Thoát khỏi nó sau 5 ngày\nTấp nập người mua chiếc đồng hồ bản sao khi nó giảm 90% hôm nay\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

Even Mae seemed cowed at this point, though it was Jamie who gave Alan his number. Alan looked a bit crestfallen but accepted it, and at least after that they were finally rid of the interlopers.\n\nNick left to get the last boxes while Jamie was still writing down his number, and by the time he emerged from the house they were gone. Nick went around the car so he and Mum would not have to come within a yard of each other.\n\nHe looked at Alan, who was standing gazing into the open boot of their car, at something in one of the boxes. When he noticed Nick looking, he smiled a small, strained smile.\n\n“I think that’s it,” Alan said. “Come on. Looking forward to London?”\n\nThey swung into the car. Nick let Alan have first shift. He was the better driver, but he was only sixteen and it would be a year before it was actually legal for him to drive. It was better to get out of Exeter, where some people knew that, before Nick had his turn.\n\n“Well,” Nick said as Alan gave him a stern look over the top of his glasses and Nick rolled his eyes and buckled his seat belt. “Let’s examine the events of the past twenty-four hours in Exeter. Ravens in the kitchen, snakes in the living room, demon marks on you, magicians sending us stupid messages, and at the end of it all you got the boy’s telephone number.”\n\nAlan tilted his head as he considered this and then laughed. Nick leaned his forehead against the car window, and the engine purred soothingly to him.\n\n“Let’s get the hell out of here,” Alan suggested.\n\nAfter an hour on the M5, Alan’s leg started to ache, and they switched places. There was never much conversation while driving because of Mum, so Nick looked straight ahead and Alan stared out at the rolling green ground, going for miles on both sides of the road. Nick glanced over at him a few times, wondering if that message was bothering him or if the demon mark was hurting him.\n\n“You all right?” he said eventually.\n\nAlan took a moment to answer. When he turned, Nick saw that half his wavy hair was sticking up from being pressed against the damp window.\n\n“Yeah,” he said. Nick’s amusement was cut short when Alan went on, “I was thinking about Mae and Jamie. It’s just — they both seem so great, and we know what’s going to happen to them. It’s terrible, that’s all. I hate it.”\n\nNick frowned out at the road. “Why do you care? You barely know them.”\n\n“I know them well enough to feel sorry for them,” Alan said. “Anyone would. I mean, don’t you feel bad for them? A little?”\n\nHe looked at Nick with a testing, expectant air. Nick didn’t know what to say.\n\nHe felt angry with them. If it hadn’t been for them, Alan would not be marked. Nick did not think that expressing this would go over well, though.\n\n“I don’t feel anything for them.”\n\nThat answer made Alan look so unhappy that Nick almost wished he had told him about the anger. Alan said nothing, though; he only turned back to the window, biting his lip.\n\nNick glanced in the rearview mirror to check on the distance between them and the car behind, and caught his mother’s reflected eyes. In the mirror they looked even colder than usual, as if she was staring at him from under ice. Her lips were drawn tight over her teeth, giving her beautiful face the appearance of a skull that still had eyes to stare. She looked at him as if she hated him, but she always did that.\n\nNick bared his teeth at her in a silent snarl and turned away from the mirror.\n\nAlan read out the directions Merris Cromwell had given him as Nick tried to work around the London lunch hour traffic. Nick didn’t like Merris much, but since Alan had helped her at the Goblin Market last October, they’d never had to crash in shelters or hostels while they looked for a place to stay. Nick wasn’t sure if she had contacts everywhere or if problems simply slunk away in the face of her formidable efficiency.\n\nIf the Market had been a magicians’ Circle, blasphemous though the idea might be, Merris would have been the Circle’s leader.\n\nShe was connected even though nobody knew where she came from, rich even though nobody knew where she got her money. Nick thought she might be the only person in the Market hiding as many secrets as they were.\n\nNick looked at a map and took a detour by Westminster so Alan could get a preview of the doubtful delights he would soon enjoy. They passed the square-spiked silhouette of Westminster Abbey, and stone saints peered down at them while Alan began to tell himself interesting historical facts, because Nick didn’t care. The spire of Big Ben and the curve of the Circle went by in a smooth line, and as Nick turned the car into less traffic-choked channels, Alan gave a happy sigh and started talking about dinosaur exhibits in the Natural History Museum.\n\n“I’ve changed my mind,” said Nick. “The demons can have you.”\n\nHe was glad that Alan seemed so pleased. Nick had not really remembered London, and looking around it now, with old and new buildings jostling each other at every turn and no street empty, he was feeling a distinct sense of foreboding.\n\nDemons liked cities. Cities meant victims, and London was teeming with bodies for the taking. Nick thought he might have made the wrong decision choosing this place, but it was too late now.\n\nCamden town opened up into a broad gray road, with a small cinema on one side, some restaurants and a gray building that said AMERICAN METHODIST CHURCH in large metal letters outside. A fine drizzle started as they drove up one of the narrow side streets and stopped in front of their new home.\n\nThe drab brown front of the house made it look as if it had been built from rusty spare parts. Someone always put lace curtains in the windows of dreary houses, and Nick was unsurprised to see the curtains making their attempts in every window of this place. There was a china garden gnome on the doorstep, wearing a desperate, crazy smile.\n\n“It’s not so bad,” Alan said.\n\n“You never take me nice places anymore, baby,” said Nick, and was mildly gratified by Alan’s ring of laughter, like a living bell that had been caught by surprise when it was struck.\n\nWhen he got out, he opened Mum’s door without thinking, and she shuddered away from Cred\n\n“Olivia,” he coaxed. “We’re here. We’re home.”\n\n“For now,” Nick muttered, going over to the boot and getting out the first box of Alan’s books.\n\nHe hefted it in his arms and put the box down only to retrieve the keys. Someone had carelessly put a dark closet where the hall should have been, but the staircase was broad and, more importantly, had a sturdy-looking wooden banister for Alan to lean on. When he got up the stairs he saw there were three bedrooms, which was always good news. Nick allocated the bedroom farthest away from the other two to Mum, and when he went into the other rooms, he saw there was a bookcase built into the wall of one. That room clearly had to be Alan’s. Nick put the box down and palmed the knife from his boot to cut the packing tape. He began to shove books on the shelves. It might be a few minutes before Alan got Mum calmed down.\n\nNick was putting down the last book in the first row when it fell.\n\nThere was a white flutter from the yellowed pages of an old book, and then, on the tired-looking carpet, lay a picture of a girl.\n\nThe girl looked older than Nick, in her late teens or perhaps twenties, with curly blond hair and a bright smile. She was wearing a loose, flowing shirt, in the kind of retro style Alan’s girls often affected, and she looked as if someone had just told her a joke.\n\nIt occurred to Nick that this picture was what Alan had been thinking of when he was standing gazing into their car boot. As soon as he was alone he’d gone straight to it, as if being near to it — even if he couldn’t see it — was his only possible source of comfort.\n\nHe hadn’t come to Nick.\n\nAlan was sentimental enough to keep pictures. The couple of girls who’d actually been his girlfriends had been awarded a place of pride in his wallet. He had a school picture of Nick and the picture of Mum and Dad on their wedding day framed by his bedside.\n\nIt was keeping a secret from Nick that was different. He’d kept only one secret from Nick before: the letters he used to rise early for and collect from the postbox. Nick rose even earlier to cut them up, and eventually they had stopped coming.\n\nNick wondered if this was a picture of the letter girl. He picked it up and looked her over more closely, but he couldn’t see anything special about her. The letters had been more than a year ago. Why should Alan still keep her picture? He flipped it over and looked at the back. TONY’S PHOTOS was printed there in gray, but over that in a black sprawl was the name “Marie.”\n\nNick heard Alan’s limping step up the stairs in plenty of time to put the photograph back where he had found it, and when his brother came into the room, he saw Alan look at the shelf in alarm.\n\nThere was no innocent explanation, then.\n\nAlan had not forgotten that the picture was in the book. He had not bought a book with a picture already inside it. He had deliberately hidden this girl, this Marie, away from him.\n\nNick remembered the girl’s smiling face and scowled, staring at the floor. He felt intensely uncomfortable. It seemed wrong that this girl should matter to Alan, when Nick didn’t even know who she was. What was so important about her, that he had to hide her from his own brother?\n\nNick planned to find out.\n\nThat night Nick slept on the kitchen floor in their new home. The cork tiles were curling up at the edges like pieces of old bread, rough against his stomach when his T-shirt rode up, and he hadn’t brought down a pillow because he didn’t want to be comfortable. He dozed uneasily, feeling like a guard dog unable to rest because he had to be on the alert for dangers outside.\n\nBut it wasn’t anything outside that he was waiting for.\n\nHe was in one of the dark places between sleep and simply having your eyes shut when he heard the sound of the front door clicking softly open. His body moved before he thought: He crossed the hall in two swift strides, fast and soft as a predator. He always found it easier to hunt than think.\n\nWhen he launched himself at Alan, he did think: He remembered to strike on Alan’s left side. They went tumbling into the grass of the front yard, and Nick landed crouched beside his brother. He’d been careful not to hurt Alan’s leg, not to even touch it, and now he felt so angry he wished he’d done it after all.\n\n“You’re not leaving,” he snarled.\n\nAlan lay flat on his back, looking up at the sky. The full moon caught his glasses and made the edges flash brief silver. “If they can track me,” he began, “it’s not safe—”\n\nNick laughed harshly. “When have we ever been safe?”\n\nHow safe would Alan be, he wanted to demand, by himself and with a demon’s mark? Maybe he would be all right; Alan could take care of himself, but Nick wasn’t about to take that chance. Nick wasn’t about to let him go.\n\nNick was breathing fast and his vision was blurred a little, turning the edges of the night hazy and pale. He felt as if he’d been exercising too hard. He was just angry at the thought that Alan could leave, so easily, for any reason at all.\n\nAlan sighed and sat up, drawing his good leg up to his chest and linking an arm around it. Nick knew this look from the days when Mum had her screaming fits, or when a teacher wanted to talk about Nick’s reading. Alan looked tired and unhappy, and the expression fit on his face too comfortably, as if he was used to feeling that way and didn’t let it affect him too much. He was too busy being concerned about what other people might feel.\n\n“Nick,” he said gently, “it isn’t that I want to go. It wouldn’t be for very long. Just until the next Goblin Market, just so that you and Olivia would be safe.”\n\nMum was the one the magicians were after, the one they’d always been after. Mum was the one who’d caused all this, and in spite of everything, Mum was the one Alan was worried sick about.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nViêm xơ gan có thể dẫn đến ung thư!

Nick stayed crouched and watchful, waiting for Alan to make any movement, willing him to give in. Alan shut his eyes and swallowed, looking so disappointed in Nick and so scared. For their mother.\n\n“I swear I will,” Nick said, voice low, threatening and promising, meaning every word. “If you go, I’ll leave her. I’ll come find you. What do you think would happen to her if we both left?”\n\nNick didn’t lie. He’d seen Alan lie to people his whole life and every time he opened a book he saw words twist across pages, their meaning slipping away from him. Words were treacherous enough without him telling lies.\n\nWhen he said something, he knew Alan would believe it.\n\nAlan opened his eyes and looked at Nick. His eyes were bleak.\n\n“All right, Nick,” he whispered. “I won’t go.”\n\nNick spoke with difficulty. “All right.”\n\nHe grabbed the bag Alan had been carrying, climbed to his feet, and went to the door without casting another look at his brother still sitting in the grass. He was tired, and he didn’t want to think anymore about Alan trying to leave.\n\nWhen he dropped the bag into Alan’s room, he saw his brother had left a note on his pillow.\n\nNick sat on Alan’s bed and tried to read it. He needed to concentrate to read, and his mind was all over the place, thoughts wild and tangled, and the words went wild and tangled too. They looked like nothing but inky thorns spreading across the blank white page.\n\nHe caught one sentence, which was I’m going to a place where I know I will be welcome.\n\nIt made him remember the picture of that girl and look across the room. There was only one gap to be seen in the crowded bookshelves. Alan had planned to leave him, but he’d meant to take the book and the hidden picture wherever he went.\n\nNick stared at the letter and felt that sharp urge to hurt something again. He palmed a knife and cut it up, once, twice, three times until the words were gone and the letter was nothing but tattered white fragments.\n\nA slight noise made Nick lift his head. He saw Alan hesitating in the doorway. He couldn’t read his face any more than he could those words. He wondered how long Alan had been standing there, watching Nick slice up his good-bye letter.\n\nThey looked at each other without speaking, and in the silence Nick wondered if Alan had told him another lie: if he’d wanted to go to that girl. If he did want to leave, after all.\n\nAlan cleared his throat. “You were right. I was being stupid.”\n\n“No kidding,” Nick said roughly.\n\n“I panicked when that message came,” Alan explained, leaning heavily against the door frame. “I couldn’t help it. I don’t want to be a danger to you, and I don’t know what to do. But if they tried this, they’ll try something else. Running away won’t solve anything. I have to think of a plan. I have to do something to settle this once and for all.”\n\nAlan’s voice gathered determination as he spoke. If he thought he was going to change Black Arthur’s mind then he was dreaming, but it was familiar and soothing for Nick to see his brother ready to plan their way out of every situation.\n\nAlan picked C%\">is up the bag Nick had carried upstairs, and Nick crossed the room to take it from him.\n\n“Give me that. I’ll put your stuff away.”\n\n“Thank you,” Alan said, smiling at him. He reached out and took the book with the hidden picture from a side pocket, smoothing his fingers — born musician’s hands, Dad had always said, long fingers that touched everything lightly — with absent affection over the cover. “I’ll take this. I’m reading it.”\n\nHe limped over to his bed, still holding the book. Nick was quiet, methodically putting away all the clothes and weapons Alan had packed, erasing any trace of the fact that Alan had meant to leave.\n\n“I’m sorry about this,” Alan said softly, surprising him. “I won’t let you down again.”\n\nNick didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know what Alan was talking about; it was ridiculous. Alan didn’t let him down. He’d never once done that.\n\n“Stop being stupid.”\n\nNick glanced over at his brother. Alan was looking serious and a little sad, standing beside the bed with the pieces of his letter scattered around his feet and his fingers tracing restless patterns over the cover of that book.\n\n“Yeah,” Alan said, and smiled at him with an obvious effort. “I’ll try.”\n\n4\n\nThe Goblin Market\n\nSTOP SULKING,” ALAN SAID AS HE PARKED THE CAR.\n\nNick was not sulking. He simply did not know why Alan exercised his considerable intelligence to achieve such stupid goals. He’d fabricated enormous lies, he’d pleaded and he’d twinkled energetically at old ladies, all in order to get Nick into school. Where Nick had no desire to be, because school was a waste of time. It meant dozens of teachers hassling him about being dyslexic, and it meant Alan working full-time when Alan wanted to go to college. If Alan would just let Nick work full time in the garage, then Alan could go to college and Nick would never be saddled with any more reading, and everyone would be happy.\n\nOnly Alan was a stubborn idiot who refused to see reason, and he had actually forced Nick into a school uniform.\n\nNick said nothing. He was trying to rumple his uniform by sitting still and directing the sheer force of his hatred at it.\n\n“You are sulking,” Alan said into the vacuum of Nick’s stony silence. “You shouldn’t be. You need to complete your education and besides, a man in uniform always looks dashing.”\n\nNick gave him the kind of look he felt a word like “dashing” deserved.\n\nAlan frowned and said, “I do wish you’d eaten breakfast.”\n\nNick’s view of his new school, a brown institutional building as square and basically uninspiring as a brick, was suddenly obscured by a girl. She was platinum blond and slim in a schoolgirl skirt.\n\nHe supposed there was something to be said for the uniform after all.\n\n“Just to please you, I will,” Nick said, and nodded in the girl’s direction. “Don’t you think she looks like breakfast?”\n\nWhile Alan checked a smile and began a lecture on speaking of women with respect, Nick snagged his bag and got out of the car. Alan leaned over the passenger seat.\n\n“Remember,” he called. “Just be yourself, and everyone will love you!”\n\nNick rolled his eyes and made a rude gesture, and Alan drove the car away laughing.\n\nSlouching toward his scholastic fate, Nick caught the blonde’s eyes while they were sliding over him, and held them. Then he winked.\n\nThere were enough pretty girls to keep Nick entertained for most of the day. The last class was computers, and while the teacher was droning on, Nick typed “Tony’s Photos” into the search engine.\n\nLuck was with him. He only had to scroll down past half a dozen Tonys who wanted to share their holiday photos with the world before he found a shop in England. Miraculously, it was not a chain. The small website, boasting a chubby and somewhat manic-looking baby, informed him that it was located in Durham.\n\nThey had never even lived in Durham — but last year they had lived in Sunderland, thirteen miles away. On the day after Christmas, Alan had disappeared for four days, talking about a Sumerian stone tablet that he’d been called in to examine. Mum had not come out of her room for the entire time Alan was away, and she would not have eaten if Nick had not gone upstairs and forced food down her throat. She’d screamed the entire time Nick was touching her.\n\nWhenever Nick had made a noise in the house, he’d known his mother was listening for it, frozen and panting as if she were a hunted animal. Alan was the one always talking, turning on the TV and the radio, bringing home the weird people who were their only guests. Nick had stopped turning on lights and appliances because it wasn’t worth the bother of sending Mum into hysterics. The house started to seem shut off from the rest of the world, darkness and silence pressing all around until Nick felt as if he could not get out. He wanted to leave, he needed to buy groceries, but he sat on the stairs and waited in the dark.\n\nWinter light had come in with Alan as he opened the door. Nick had looked up from his place on the stairs and said, “You can’t do this again.”\n\nAlan went pale and answered, “I won’t.”\n\nDuring the four days of darkness, it had never occurred to Nick that Alan could possibly have been lying, or could possibly have abandoned them for his own reasons.\n\nIt was occurring to him now.\n\nNick took down the address and phone number of Tony’s Photos in Durham, and then closed the window.\n\nThe next day at school Nick went and found his new crowd. There was a large bike shed around back of the school, which looked like a concrete block Kconick with a sheet of tinfoil on top. He’d seen it yesterday and known at once that this was the place.\n\nSure enough, there were three boys there already, two of them smoking. One dropped his cigarette on the gravel as soon as he saw Nick. He’d be no trouble. Nick raised his eyebrows, saw the boy’s eyes drop in embarrassment, and turned to the boy who’d kept smoking.\n\n“Nick Ryves,” he said. “Mind if I join you?”\n\nHe threw out the words like a challenge. He’d found that was the best way to start things, since it always ended up that way in the end.\n\nThe boy eyed him with what Nick thought was an unusual amount of hostility to start off with. Usually it took Nick a couple of weeks to antagonize people to that degree.\n\n“Carr,” he said at last. “Joe Carr.”\n\nHe was the usual type: He’d be snarling and trying to trip Nick up all the time, like a terrier with a Rottweiler in his yard. Still, much like a terrier, he’d stick around and never cause Nick any real trouble.\n\nAlan had made him promise not to take up smoking. Nick always regretted that on the first day at new schools, when he wished he could smoke instead of talking. He hated talking to strangers. Sooner or later, he always said something that pulled someone up short, and then he had to glare them all into submission.\n\nNew schools were always a pain. He could hear Dad in his head all the time on the first days, telling him to blend in, telling him to try and be just like everyone else. All their lives depended on it.\n\n“Nice place you have here,” Nick said after a beat. “Love the scenery. Especially that Cathy girl.”\n\n“Cassie is my girlfriend,” Joe snapped at him.\n\n“Whoops,” Nick said. “Oh well.”\n\nThe other two boys snickered, and Nick grinned at them. He’d picked the right group again. When he was little, he’d gravitated toward what was familiar and tried to make friends with people who were like Alan, only without guns hidden under their button-up shirts. People who talked too much and did their homework and who, on reflection, he’d kind of scared.\n\nThis was much easier. Dad would’ve approved.\n\nHe sat at the back of their next class with Lewis, the boy who hadn’t been smoking. He was still thinking of the picture girl from Durham and he forgot to talk at all, which was a mistake. Long silences made people uneasy.\n\n“You all right?” Lewis asked, shifting as far away from Nick as he could.\n\n“Fine,” Nick snapped, and then thought of Dad. “Just girl problems, you know,” he added as casually as he could.\n\nThe other boy sighed, sounding reassured. “Girls always turn out to be problems.”\n\n“Yeah,” Nick answered absentmindedly.\n\nHe was still thinking of that hidden picture, that possible hidden trip. He had no problem with Alan’s crushes on girls like Mae, girls who weren’t interested and who were going to be left behind. A girl who could make Ala Kcouushn lie to Nick, though, that was something he wasn’t going to tolerate. He had to know what was going on.\n\nHe grinned at Lewis. “She won’t be a problem much longer.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nViêm xơ gan có thể dẫn đến ung thư!

Sadly, neither of the girls was pretty blond Cassie.\n\nNick got home after dark, feeling good about the whole group thing being sorted. He thought again that Dad would’ve been proud.\n\nHe found Alan in their tiny sitting room, on the floor by the coffee table. The coffee table was covered with papers, and Alan’s head was in his hands.\n\n“Alan,” Nick said, in a command for him to be all right.\n\nAlan lifted his head. “Hi,” he said, and tried for a smile. “I didn’t — I didn’t hear you come in.”\n\n“What’s going on?” Nick barked at him. “What’s wrong? Is that stupid mark hurting you?”\n\nThe contented feeling of a job well done evaporated. Nick abruptly wanted to hit something.\n\nAlan sighed. “No.”\n\nThe answer came to Nick, inevitable as the tide coming in. Of course it was all Mum’s fault.\n\n“It’s that stupid messenger and what she said to you.”\n\n“I’m just trying to come up with a plan,” Alan told him.\n\nHe sounded worn and frayed as an old shirt. Nick hated it; his desire to hit something increased. He walked over to the table instead, to where Alan sat looking tired and rather small.\n\nThe papers on the table had magical symbols all over them, drawings of demons’ circles and protective amulets. There were papers covered in Alan’s scrawling handwriting, and then papers with single lines written on them, which had obviously been tossed aside.\n\n“I like this plan,” Nick told him, selecting one of the papers with just one line on it.\n\nThe paper read, in large, almost frantic-looking letters: Kill them all.\n\n“It’s a lovely plan, but it wouldn’t work,” Alan said, his voice almost amused. He ran his fingers through his hair. “I need to talk to Merris. I’ve got the numbers of about a dozen people who work for her, and none of them will put me through.”\n\n“Can she help?” Nick asked.\n\n“I don’t know,” Alan said, a note of bleakness creeping in. “God, I hope so. We might have to wait until the Goblin Market; we’ll see her then.”\n\nNick nodded, and then hesitated. He couldn’t think of a way to say what he wanted to, and for a moment he was tempted to let it go, but he looked down at Alan’s bowed head and tried all the same.\n\n“Don’t—” he said, and stopped. “You’ve got a demon’s mark on you. This isn’t the time to think about—” He thought of Mum and Mae and the girl in the picture. “Don’t worry about anyone else. If it bothers you so much, I’ll do K I&m a something about Mum. I’ll find a way to help her. Whatever you need, I’ll do it. Just make sure that you’re all right. Nobody else matters.”\n\nAlan looked up at him with dark troubled eyes, blue under shadows.\n\n“I know she isn’t good to you, but you’ve lived with her all your life. Does the idea of her dying—” He swallowed. “Do you care at all?”\n\nNick wondered why Alan was looking at him with those pleading eyes. Nick had said he would help already.\n\n“You care,” he said. “That’s enough. I’ll help her even if I don’t care. What does it matter?”\n\nAlan looked down at his crumpled papers.\n\n“We’ll go to the Goblin Market and get everything sorted out,” Nick said forcefully. “I told you. Don’t worry about anything but yourself.”\n\nAt a new school the teachers always took a while to go over Nick’s reading problems, and Nick always took a while to go over the girls. At home they spent all their time going for their weapons at every noise, waiting for the magicians to do what they had promised and come after Alan. Given that he and Alan had to find new jobs, too, for the first week in London, Nick had no time to do anything about Alan’s mark or his secret.\n\nHe thought about both, whether he had time or not, and he could not stop uneasily watching Alan in case he decided to bolt. It came as an enormous relief when Alan informed him that the next Goblin Market would be held near Tiverton in a few days’ time.\n\n“It’s the closest place to Exeter they could have chosen,” Alan said. “We can pick up Mae and Jamie on the way.”\n\nNick rolled his eyes. “Thrill me, why don’t you.”\n\nPerhaps he would find Mae’s hidden picture next. He scowled at the thought, and Alan caught his expression.\n\n“You don’t have to dance, you know,” he said.\n\n“I told you,” Nick answered, still frowning. “I want to.”\n\nHe would deal with the mark and the threat to Mum, and find out about Marie. His brother would be safe. Everything would be like it was before.\n\nAlan went off to call Jamie.\n\nThey arranged to meet Mae and Jamie outside Northernhay Gardens in Exeter, around back of the old wall. It was quiet and already growing dark by the time they pulled up. Unfortunately, the headlights of the car were bright enough for them to see Mae’s outfit quite clearly.\n\n“Oh my God,” said Nick, and shut his eyes.\n\nJamie gave a small, nervous laugh.\n\n“What?” Mae demanded. “Alan told us that we were supposed to dress as we truly are!”\n\nThe mad girl was wearing a pink silk crop top and a long white skirt that was all gauze and frills. Every inch of her was decked with metal. She wore ankle bracelets on each ankle, had an army of gleaming bangles lined up along both arms, and was laden down with necklaces. They reminded Nick of the charms around his mother’s neck, a metallic tangle linked into chains by the years.\n\n“And you felt that what you truly are is a Christmas tree with too much tinsel.” Nick grinned. “Huh.”\n\n“Stop it,” said Alan, and then blushed. “I think you look very nice, Mae.”\n\nThe sudden smile Mae gave Alan was as sweet as it was unexpected. Alan smiled helplessly back, and Nick thought over this new development. On one hand, if Mae was going to start smiling at him, Alan might sink to even greater depths of idiocy. On the other hand, the girl had a nice smile, Alan seemed happy, and soon they would be at the Goblin Market. Alan’s mark could be removed, and so could Nick’s constant irritable feeling that something had gone terribly wrong with the world.\n\nHe was beginning to feel cautiously optimistic about this trip.\n\nNick drove away from Exeter through the narrow, jolting roads toward Tiverton. Alan’s mouth tightened with every bump in the road, and Nick was almost grateful when the tourists in the back started asking questions.\n\nJamie coughed. “This may be a silly question, but are there, er — goblins at the Goblin Market?”\n\n“No,” said Nick. “Everyone at the Market is human, just like you.”\n\n“Just like me,” Jamie echoed skeptically.\n\n“Well,” said Nick. “Probably smarter than you.”\n\n“It’s named for a market in a poem,” Alan explained. “The poem mentions magical fruit being sold in a market. We have magical fruit as well — we just don’t sell it.”\n\n“Magical fruit? Like…lemons of sorcery? What do you do with them?”\n\nNick tossed a cold look over his shoulder at Jamie. “You’ll see.”\n\nJamie pointedly addressed the next question to Alan alone. “So why is the Goblin Market being held in Tiverton? It’s tiny.”\n\nAlan spread his hands over the dashboard as if it was a lectern, and as if he could form explanatory shapes out of the air if he gestured enthusiastically enough. He’d have liked to be a college professor or something of that sort, Nick thought, and would have been, if it hadn’t been for Mum.\n\n“Tiverton means twy ford ton — the town of two fords. The river Exe and the River Lowman meet at Tiverton, and that means it is protected from attack. Possessed bodies do not like to cross running water.”\n\nThe Goblin Market was not being held in the town center, of course. People might have asked a few questions about selling amulets and calling demons in the streets.\n\nIt would take place in the old Shrink Hills, past the point where Cranmore Castle stood. Nick and Alan had been to Tiverton before, when the Goblin Market was held there nine years ago. Nick had danced in those hills before. It had been his second Goblin Market, and Dad’s last.\n\n“It’s supposed to be lucky to hold the Goblin Market in a place with some history attached to it,” Alan went on happily. “It’s one of the Goblin Market mottoes: ‘Our world, claimed by our kind.’ Cranmore Castle was a hill fort in the Iron Age, and in 1549 one of the battles of the Prayer Book Rebellion was fought here. It was a battle over whether a child should be christened in the new religion or the old.”\n\n“Who won?” asked Mae.\n\n“What does it matter?” Nick inquired. “All anyone knows is where the bones were found.”\n\nTiverton was in view on the darkening horizon, a gray mass in the night, dominated by a church and castle that leaned together in a fellowship of crumbling stone and decayed glory in the midst of small streets and tall trees.\n\nThey stopped on a dirt road a few fields away from Cranmore Castle, which was now nothing but a mound, gray in the night but green under a daytime sky, a lump in the ground where people had once lived, and lived no longer.\n\n“I expected something a little more castle-shaped,” said Jamie.\n\n“Nothing lasts forever,” Nick said. “Except demons, of course.”\n\n“Has anyone ever told you that you’re a charming conversationalist?” Jamie asked.\n\n“No,” Nick replied honestly.\n\n“I cannot tell you how much that surprises me,” Jamie told him, and Nick gave him a half smile. Nick’s blood was already racing.\n\nThere was always a chance that someone had let slip the location of the Goblin Market. Everyone came to the Market prepared for a fight. Everyone was aware of the possibility that magicians might descend upon them on Market night and try to wipe them all out with one blow.\n\nThe air on Market nights was always strung tight with nervous excitement. The Market was always balanced on the edge of destruction.\n\nNick looked out into the night and let his smile spread. That was why he liked it.\n\n“Where is this Market?” Mae asked.\n\nAlan spoke before Nick could tell her to hush. “It’s all right,” he said. “I’ve got directions. The Market is left of the crooked tree, outside the beaten path, and straight on to the moon.”\n\nJamie blinked and said, “Thank you for clearing that up, Alan.”\n\nHis face was pale in the moonlight as they climbed out into the darkness of a country road, fields and trees massed around them on both sides. Nick had not looked at Jamie particularly, except to note with gratitude that he was not dressed up like Mae, but now that he did look, he was sure the boy was thinner than he had been a couple of weeks ago. He and his sister were both shaking, but Nick thought that with Mae it was excitement. With Jamie, it looked like fear.\n\nOf course, once Alan noticed that, he was drawn to Jamie like a mother hen to the littlest chick in the farmyard.\n\n“I know the way,” he said, and offered up the warm, sweet smile that always made people believe he wasn’t carrying six concealed weapons. “Walk with me.” He paused and added, “I see you’re not dazzling us all like Mae.”\n\n“Well, I thought — I thought that I usually look like what I really am.”\n\nAlan’s smile became less reassuring and more genuine. “I’ve always thought the same.”\n\nNick was glad that Alan felt no need to complement his shirt and jeans with a little earring, but on the whole he approved of Jamie’s decision to look halfway normal. His approval must have been obvious, because as he followed Alan up the hill, Mae fell into step with him and spoke in a combative tone.\n\n“You’re dressed up,” she said. “You’re all in black and you’re carrying a sword. How is that different?”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐừng bỏ qua chiếc đồng hồ bản sao Omega này khi nó giảm 90%\nWatchthuysichinhhang\nHết đau trĩ, bệnh cấp độ 4 cũng phải teo với thứ này\nSuckhoevungcao"

Then he remembered that this girl was off-limits. He shook his head impatiently and lengthened his stride so she would have to scurry to keep up.\n\nThe tree branches overhead were curled around each other like cats leering down at them from the shadows, and the leaves were thick enough to hide the moon. Alan’s red hair looked as black as Nick’s as Nick drew level with them.\n\nAlan broke off a conversation about the beautiful poetry of Christina Risotto or whoever, of all things, to give Nick a reproachful look. “You left Mae?”\n\nThat much was obvious, so Nick didn’t bother to answer him. Alan turned and limped back to Mae. When she drew level with him, he offered her his arm.\n\nNick, left alone with Jamie, felt it his duty to make things clear.\n\n“I realize the fact that my brother talks about poetry is misleading,” he said. “But he’s not that way, all right?”\n\nJamie gave him a look, then redirected the look. Nick followed his gaze to Alan stooping over Mae and apparently doing an impression of a lame stork attempting a mating dance.\n\n“Really,” Jamie said dryly. “I would never have guessed.”\n\nNick scowled.\n\nThey walked on until there was no path, only grass stretching out on all sides until it was blotted out by the dark fringe of the woods. Alan took the lead from the point where the path failed, but it was obvious to them all where to go. Someone had arranged to have cars parked at strategic points along the fields. The car roofs caught moonbeams, and every metallic place where the light fell formed a bright stepping-stone for them to follow.\n\nOn the far side of the mound of earth that people still called Cranmore Castle were enough trees to be counted as wood. Streaming from the heart of the wood, glowing among the leaves and warm against the tree trunks, they saw light from the lamps of the Goblin Market.\n\nNick fell into step with Alan, leaving the other two to follow them as they chose. He heard a sharp exclamation behind him as they walked into the wood, but he did not know which of them had made it, or why. People were usually taken like that by the Market at first.\n\nIt was impossible to see all of the Goblin Market at once. The stalls were placed in a zigzagging circle around the trees, glinting at intervals like secret treasure. There was one stall, and then another, and before they had taken more than a few steps, there were stalls on all sides. The bright drapes over the stall fronts were like flags being flown to declare war. The lamps, hung in twisting pathways up in the boughs, swung in the wind and cast their light on first one stall and then another.\n\nFor a moment the spotlight fell on a stall hung with dream catchers, the real kind, bones and feathers and thread formed in the patterns to silence the voices in your head and keep the demons from your bed. Then it swung to a table laden with words, clay tablets tumbled with calfskin-bound volumes, cheap paperbacks lying with scrolls. One stall made its own illumination, since it was hung about with what the Market people called fairy lamps. There were the glowworm lamps to attract your true love, and the beacon lamps you set in a window to call a wanderer home.\n\nNick took a moment to scan the swaying lights and the shadows creeping around them, the bright stalls and the dark cleared spaces where the dancers were practicing, and then relaxed. There were no gaps in the lines of the stalls and no familiar faces missing. The Market was just as it had been last month, and with luck it would be just the same next month too.\n\nThey all had to keep quiet for fear of discovery, so the drums were muffled and the stall owners’ voices were like the clear, low sound of chimes ringing from all sides.\n\n“Come buy!” sang out clearly from every stall. “Come buy!”\n\n“We can buy things like this with ordinary money?” Mae asked, her voice half-awed and half-dubious. “We’re supposed to buy help?”\n\n“We may be the only defense against magicians and demons that there is,” Nick said. “No reason not to turn a profit.”\n\nPhyllis from the chimes stall noticed them first. The Market was in full swing and people were mostly concentrating on business, haggling and comparison shopping. Light glanced on faces without illuminating them.\n\n“Chimes?” Phyllis asked. “Chimes to call a lover? Chimes with the voice of a bird trapped in them? Chimes that play you whatever song you most desire to hear?”\n\n“No thanks,” said Nick. “We’ve got MTV.”\n\nShe peered among the glinting metal and crystal of her wares, and her face cleared. “Oh, Nick, it’s you! Alan, my sweet, come here and kiss an old woman. You get taller every year.”\n\n“You get younger every year,” Alan said, stooping in among the chimes to kiss her.\n\nThe stall owners of the Goblin Market had the same indulgent attitude to Alan as all the teachers, landladies, and shopkeepers. Human nature didn’t change, whether you sold love charms or toilet rolls.\n\n“Soothing charms for your poor mother?” asked Phyllis, who had never seen Mum. “Guaranteed to calm an uneasy mind. Special price for you.”\n\n“Not tonight, Phyllis,” Alan answered. “Nick’s dancing, and we need to buy a speaking charm. Have you seen Merris?”\n\n“No,” Phyllis said, her eyes suddenly gleaming brighter than her chimes. “Nick’s dancing?”\n\nNick took Alan by the scruff of his neck and dragged him away bodily. Alan made the usual protesting sounds about that, but Nick noticed he didn’t try to go back. Nick had forgotten, but he remembered now. He remembered when he was seven and Dad had first asked him to dance, and the way everyone had stared, because he was so young, because the dance came so easily to him. Because the demons came so easily to him.\n\nAlan paused by a stall selling talismans and Nick waited for him, arms crossed over his chest and trying to ignore the rising tide of whispers around him. People who danced in the circle were not magicians. They just had to have enough coordination to keep within the lines of the dance, but their dance called demons. It looked like magic. If people had known Nick’s mother was a magician, if they had known how Nick’s talisman hurt him, they would have called it magic.\n\nAlan put his thin shoulder supportively behind Nick’s and did not say a word, which was how Nick liked things best.\n\n“Fancy a sword forged in lightning? Get your genuine lightning-born blades here! Comes with a free enchanted knife.”\n\nThe gleam of sharp steel under colored lights drew Nick like a beacon lamp. Alan moved with him, having Nick’s back, and murmured appreciation at the sight of a beautiful sword Nick had instinctively reached out for. Carl had some gorgeous new stuff in this month.\n\n“You guys have magical arms dealers, too?” Jamie asked faintly.\n\n“We do need weapons,” said Alan. “They cost a lot in the outside world. Here in the Market you can barter and lay up credit.”\n\nNick slid the sword out of a sleek leather sheath. It made a faint, seductive ringing sound in the air, as if it was begging Nick to take it home.\n\nIt looked expensive, though, and a short sword was really more practical for concealment purposes.\n\nNick weighed the hilt against his palm; it fit his hand, the balance of the blade perfect. When he stepped back and made a few passes with it, the movement felt as natural and sweet as that of his own muscles. He looked up from his absorption in the glittering metal and met Alan’s warm, pleased eyes.\n\n“Like it?”\n\n“We can’t afford it,” Nick said. He meant to sound practical, but his voice came out curt.\n\n“Oh, we could—” Mae began.\n\n“No!” Nick snapped.\n\n“No, but thank you,” Alan told her, gentle but firm. “It’s okay, Nick. I did some extra translations this month and saved up the credit. It’s the first Market since your birthday. Did you think I wasn’t going to get you anything?”\n\n“Oh,” Nick said.\n\nThat was why the sword felt like it had been made for him. It had been. Alan couldn’t use a sword himself, his balance was completely off, but he knew all about the design of a good blade. Nick looked at the deadly, beautiful thing again, and while he was looking down, he smiled.\n\n“Like it?” Carl asked with a broad grin. He tossed the sheath at Nick, and Nick caught it absently in his free hand.\n\nNick shrugged. “It’s not so bad.”\n\n“Think it came out rather well, if I do say so myself,” Carl bragged. “Your brother wanted nothing but the best. Wish I had a brother.”\n\n“Yeah,” Nick said. “He’s not so bad either.”\n\n“Well, I’ve been thinking we could use an enchanted knife,” Alan said, taking the knife that came free with the purchase and sliding it into his pocket. He reached out to pat Nick’s shoulder or something stupid, and Nick stepped easily away from him, eyes still on the sword.\n\nThey walked on through the Market, weaving through tourists, necromancers with their bone toys and worn teeth, and pied pipers playing instruments that sang with human voices. Nick could not quite bring himself to sheath his new sword, and Alan kept by his side, and if that had been all, it would have been a great Market night.\n\nUnfortunately, he and Alan had not come to the Market alone.\n\nBehind them, Mae said, “All this stuff — it’s magic, isn’t it? I thought you said the magicians were the evil ones. What’s the difference?”\n\n“The difference, my dear girl,” said a new but familiar voice to their left, “is that we use magical things, but none of us have magical powers.”\n\nNick wasn’t so sure of that, but it was a matter of pride in the Goblin Market. Magicians tended to be the ones with the most power, the ones tainted by it. While the Market folk put up with visitors who could do magic, not one would admit to having a drop of natural power themselves.\n\nA long time ago the Market had been set up to provide help for magicians’ victims. All the born Market folk claimed they were descended from those who had stumbled upon the magicians’ secrets and had sworn to help the innocent and defenseless. Nobody wanted to admit that the people most likely to find out magicians’ secrets were magicians’ families, or magicians themselves.\n\nNick thought it was just as stupid to deny the fact that some of the Market shopkeepers had magic as it was to deny the fact that what had started out as using magical objects had become a buying and selling of magical objects: that the Market was not about a crusade anymore but about earning a living.\n\nEveryone pretended the world was different than it was. Nick supposed he shouldn’t be surprised. After all, most people did not even know magic existed. People were good at being blind.\n\nThe voice continued: “Magicians give victims to demons, which means that demons will give them anything they want. The people of the Market can only summon demons in the dance. We would prefer not to summon them at all, but we are desperate. The demons will come because they are desperate too, so hungry for our world that anything is better than nothing, but they will give very little in exchange. So we have to stand against the magicians armed with nothing but the information we can gather from demons and little magic toys. These are not attractive odds, which is why I think we should start giving bodies to the demons for the greater good. We can start with people who ask stupid questions.”\n\nMerris Cromwell emerged from the recesses of her dim and crowded stall, her dress sweeping the ground as she came. She wore her talisman as a brooch, crystals and bones and silk threads forming an intricate pattern under frosted glass, and no other jewelry. She was not the type who depended on anything someone else provided, so she had a scarlet-screened lamp attached to the front of her own stall. Crimson-tinted light fell on her face, on the almost rectangular jaw and the gray-streaked hair, scraped back from a forehead the shape of a cathedral dome.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐừng bỏ qua chiếc đồng hồ bản sao Omega này khi nó giảm 90%\nWatchthuysichinhhang\nHết đau trĩ, bệnh cấp độ 4 cũng phải teo với thứ này\nSuckhoevungcao"

Dùng ngay\nElectric Saving Box\n\nEveryone in the Goblin Market had a specialty. Phyllis sold her chimes, the Davies family told fortunes, the Morrises did metalwork, and the silent twins sold words in every form, all the books and tablets and scrolls you could dream of. Merris’s stall was loaded with what looked like specimens from every stall. She specialized in being the best.\n\n“She’s joking,” Alan explained to Mae. “Merris, this is Mae and Jamie.”\n\nMerris unbent slightly. “Alan’s young lady, I presume?”\n\nMae actually blushed. “Er — no.”\n\n“Young Nicholas’s, then,” Merris said wearily. “What they all see in you, I cannot imagine.”\n\nNick leaned against the stall and smirked at her. “You’ll never know until you try.”\n\nMerris gave him a quelling look, and Alan nobly distracted her. “They’re people we’re trying to help. Merris, Nick is going to dance tonight. We need a speaking charm.”\n\nShe thought for a moment, and then leaned over to produce a clay tablet from the heaps of her stall. “I want the translation by next month,” she said. “Don’t let Nicholas touch it; it happens to be five thousand years old.”\n\nAlan glanced at it and nodded, and only then did she press a gleaming white shell on a chain into Alan’s palm and close his fingers over it. Merris Cromwell was the only seller at the Goblin Market who never accepted money. She traded in favors. She had enough money, though nobody knew where she got it. Her currency was power.\n\n“Alan, what language is that?” Mae asked, peering at the tablet and looking excited. No wonder Alan’s little crush was so persistent. Nick hadn’t realized she was a big nerd.\n\n“Sumerian,” Alan said.\n\n“The oldest written language in the world, from the world’s first civilization,” Merris explained condescendingly. “It was the written language for Babylon as well. Half of what we know about magic comes from Sumerian records. I do not know what they teach you children in school these days.”\n\nMae looked impressed. “You can read Sumerian?”\n\nNick believed that Merris Cromwell was as fond of Alan as she could be fond of something that was not a magical artifact, but she was a businesswoman. She looked extremely bored by the exchange of Sumerian sweet nothings and turned her attention to Nick.\n\n“Which of your demons do you mean to call?”\n\n“Anzu,” Nick said.\n\nPeople used to laugh at him because he had only ever been able to call two demons, but he was able to call them faster than anyone else, and he never made a mistake.\n\n“Er, excuse me, but how do you call a demon with dancing?” said Jamie, glancing from Merris back to her stall. He looked a lot less caught up in the glamour of it all than Mae did, and he was smiling the nervous smile that Nick was coming to recognize. “Do demons have disco fever?”\n\nHe was so weird. Nick didn’t understand him at all.\n\nMerris Cromwell looked as if nobody had ever uttered the words “disco fever” in her presence before. She did not deign to respond to Jamie. Instead she nodded at the shadows and a man Nick did not recognize took her place at the stall. Merris walked through the Goblin Market, sweeping the rest of them in her wake, until they reached the place of the dancers.\n\nThere was a spot where the stalls ended and the Market did not, a clearing full of light and music. There were dozens of little lights in the trees above, bright as stars that had somehow become tangled in the branches, and under the lights the grass looked silver and the night behind the dancers’ heads looked like a black velvet backdrop.\n\nThere were about six couples already. The women wore bright colors, slashed skirts spinning out like vivid petals as if they were pansies who had come alive after dark. The men were their gliding shadows, all in black, and Nick was aware of Mae’s glance toward him.\n\nNick gave her a sidelong smile and concentrated on the dancers, on the dark-haired girl wearing poppy red. When the men lifted the girls, she looked like she was flying, her partner’s hands trying to pull her back down to earth and him. She was fast the way a swordsman had to be fast and beautiful with it, a twist of crimson in the air like a trace of blood in water, and the tourists gathering began to resemble sharks.\n\nAll the girls wore crowns of fever blossoms. The orange and red petals looked like tiny flames set in the swift dancer’s dark hair.\n\nIf a dancer threw someone a fever blossom, it was a token of special favor.\n\nThe crowd surrounding the dancers rustled and murmured as the dark-haired dancer drew a blossom from her crown. A slow smile curved her cherry-ripe, gleaming lips. The dancers all spun in perfect synchronized circles, shadow and light, and as she spun the girl in red blew on the blossom cupped in her palm.\n\nThe petals burst into the air like a flurry of multicolored butterflies, flying to the winds. The crowd sighed with disappointment and the release of tension. The dancing ceased.\n\nThe girl in red broke away from her partner and came toward them.\n\nBefore anyone else could speak, Mae said eagerly, “That was amazing.”\n\nNick laughed a soft, surprised laugh. Girls did not usually react to Sin like that. Mae turned to him with her face bright, her eyes dazzled, and he let her see him smile.\n\n“That was just for the tourists,” he said. “Wait until you see the real thing.”\n\n5\n\nDancing Up a Demon\n\nNICK DID NOT SMILE AT MAE FOR LONG, BECAUSE HE WAS busy being kissed by another girl.\n\nSin Davies, the best dancer in the Market, reached him and leaned up, resting her palms against his shoulders, to give him a kiss. It landed light as a butterfly, as a petal, in the area between Nick’s mouth and cheek. “You’re dressed for dancing,” she said in her throaty stage voice.\n\n“Being undressed for dancing occurred to me, but I didn’t think Merris would like it.”\n\nSin slid a look over to Merris, who did not look any more outraged by Nick than usual, and then laughed. Sin was the hot tip to succeed Merris as the unofficial leader of the Market, and Merris was the one who had looked after the Davies family since magicians had killed Sin’s mother; Sin would do anything for her. Merris had been unimpressed when Sin had thrown Nick a fever blossom on a warm night last summer.\n\nNick seldom cared much about girls, but for that one night he’d thought maybe he could like this one.\n\nMerris pointedly introduced Mae and Jamie, and Sin flashed a bright, practiced smile at them. It warmed into a real smile as Mae enthused over her dancing, and it became an entirely different smile, something secret and tender, when Sin’s little sister ran up to tell her the baby was in bed.\n\n“Thank you,” Sin said, fingers lingering in the child’s blond hair.\n\nThe way she was with her baby brother and younger sister was one of the reasons Nick had noticed her.\n\n“Come here, sweetheart,” said Alan helpfully. He knelt with some difficulty on the grass, and the child ran to his arms as all children did, instinctively seeing him as a refuge. He whispered something to her, low and sweet, and Lydie laughed.\n\n“Thanks,” Sin said without looking at him, her mouth a thin straight slash of red.\n\n“You’re welcome, Cynthia,” Alan replied, his voice distant.\n\nThe way all the dancers acted around Alan was one of the reasons Nick had stopped dancing and one of the reasons he had not spent any time alone with Sin since last year. It was almost reasonable, Nick supposed. Dancers relied only on their strength, their sure feet, to save themselves from the demons. Even seeing someone stumble made a dancer wince; seeing someone crippled was like seeing their own death.\n\nNick understood all that and did not care. Nobody was allowed to look at his brother like they did.\n\nHe glared at Sin, who looked badly startled. Then he looked away and met Mae’s eyes. The excited flush in her cheeks was fading, and she was watching them carefully.\n\nShe turned to Merris and said, her voice loud in the sudden silence, “Will you tell me how the real dances work?”\n\nIt was such a banal tourist question that everyone relaxed. Sin turned to a couple of the other dancers, Alan began Srs,th= murmuring to the child again, and Merris gave Mae an approving look. Merris’s favorites were always the ones who knew how to manage situations to their own advantage.\n\nMerris reached over and plucked a fever blossom from Sin’s shining hair. “These flowers grow on trees that need magic to feed them. The trees bear fever fruit; once dancers eat fever fruit, their perceptions of the world are altered and their inhibitions are lowered. In this state they can share energy with demons. They dance in magical circles and perform exorcisms.”\n\n“Exorcisms?”\n\nMerris raised her eyebrows. “Calling demons into this world is usually referred to as an exorcism.”\n\n“I thought that meant getting rid of demons,” said Jamie.\n\n“Exorcism means naming the demon and commanding it,” Merris Cromwell answered. “Often people do try commanding the demon to leave, but once a demon has a human body, it will not leave without destroying the body. Call a demon into the circle and bribe it, though, and it may do what you want. If you offer enough.”\n\nThe dancers were already cutting the lines for the weaving. Each had already cut their own circle in the ground, perfect circles set about with charms to keep the demons inside. The demons were always trying to get out, but not even a magician would let a demon go free.\n\nNick knelt on the ground, motioning away the offer of a ceremonial knife. He preferred to use his own weapons, even if he did have to sharpen them afterward. He took his largest knife from a sheath strapped around his ribs and began to cut his circle. The blade bit deep into the earth and he made a symmetrical circle with the ease of long habit, his hands remembering the symbols and guiding the blade without input from his brain.\n\nFirst there was the circle itself. Then he cut the lines for walking between the worlds, traveling out from the center like the spokes of a wheel. He cut two circles intersecting to represent worlds colliding. He cut straight lines through those, the lines of communication that would hang between him and the demon like magical telephone wires so that the demon would be able to understand human speech and the silent communication of the demon would be translated into human words for Nick. Later he would have to walk each line perfectly, in a series of measured steps, or the demon would never come and the circle would remain silent and still.\n\n“A dancer calls a demon into the circle — but a dancer does much more than that,” Alan said in his earnest teacher’s voice. His arm was still around the little girl, but he pointed out the intersecting lines with his free hand. “This is the weaving. It opens up a connection between a human and a demon, so the demon can feel some of what the human is feeling. A dancer has to follow the lines of the weaving perfectly, even while he takes fever fruit to lessen his control.”\n\n“Demons always demand a price,” said Merris Cromwell. “That is why magicians are corrupt. A magician is someone who wants something for nothing — they are willing to let someone else pay the price for what they want. A dancer opens himself up to demons. He lets the demon share a few beats of his heart, a few breaths from his lungs, and Alan’s right, the demon can feel what the dancer feels. The dancer shares a part of himself with the demon in the dance, but he has to be careful what he says when the demon comes. If he says the wrong thing or takes a wrong step, then the demon can have all of him.”\n\nMerris Cromwell regarded the circles with a slightly wistful air. The story in the Goblin Market was that she had been a famous dancer when she was a girl.\n\nJamie looked extremely alarmed. His eyes darted from the dancers — some of them already stretching, most lying on the earth cutting the lines of the weaving — to Nick.\n\n“Alan will be the one doing the talking,” Nick explained.\n\n“That’s what the speaking charm is for,” said Alan. “So I can speak for Nick. Demons trick you, and the fever fruit lowers your defenses, so—”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐừng bỏ qua chiếc đồng hồ bản sao Omega này khi nó giảm 90%\nWatchthuysichinhhang\nHết đau trĩ, bệnh cấp độ 4 cũng phải teo với thứ này\nSuckhoevungcao"

It’s often couples, because, um — the demons are attracted to strong feelings, and the fever fruit lowers inhibitions, and, er—”\n\n“It’s all very Magical Circle Dancers Gone Wild,” Nick interrupted, and tucked his knife away. “You’ll see.”\n\n“We can ask about Jamie,” Alan continued, looking relieved to be on a safer subject.\n\n“I’m getting that damn mark off Alan,” Nick corrected, so that everyone was clear. “I might get around to Jamie later.”\n\nMae’s eyes had a bright, strange look about them. They were fixed on Alan. “So it matters if you care about what the demon has to offer,” she said slowly. “That’s why Nick is doing it for you.”\n\nNick looked away into the darkness of night and tangled trees. He did not hear Alan reply. It was possible that Alan nodded. It was possible that Mae simply swept on without waiting for an answer.\n\n“And you don’t have to be able to do magic?” Nick could look at Alan then, and he saw him nod this time. At Alan’s nod Mae went on, her voice gathering determination. “If it’s just steps along those lines, I can do it. I want to do it. I want to dance. I can ask the demons to help my brother myself.”\n\nOf course it was all about helping her brother, and nothing to do with being a dazzled tourist.\n\n“You can’t dance,” Nick said flatly.\n\n“I can,” said Mae, the light of battle in her eyes. “I’m a good dancer.”\n\n“I don’t care,” Nick snapped. “If you get one step wrong, then calling the demons won’t work, and calling the demons is going to work. This isn’t clubbing, sweetheart. This is my dance. And I say you can’t do it.”\n\nA moment afterward Nick knew he had made a mistake. Merris Cromwell did not like anyone besides herself to assume authority. Her face changed as she looked down at the small and defiant shape of Mae.\n\n“If you want to help your brother,” she said, in her cool voice, “that might make a great difference. How much do you want to help him? Are you desperate?”\n\n“Mae, don’t,” said Jamie.\n\nMae met Merris’s eyes. “Yes.”\n\n“That’s good,” said Merris. “The demons will like that.”\n\n“I’ll do anything—”\n\nMerris made a hoarse, abrupt sound that was almost a squawk. She sounded like a kicked crow. “You must understand, you have to be very careful about what you say. None of that ‘I’ll do anything.’ The demon will be trying to twist any word into a promise so it can possess you.”\n\n“I promise I’ll be careful,” Mae said breathlessly.\n\n“Well,” Merris said, with a certain amount of approval. “If you dance with an experienced partner like Nick, it might do.”\n\n“She’s not dancing with me,” Nick snarled.\n\n“Be sensible, Nick,” Merris told him. “You always do best with an emotional partner.”\n\n“That’s true,” added Sin over her shoulder. She was looking at Mae with some sympathy.\n\nIt was true. Everyone always said it was because Nick didn’t have much feeling to share with the demons. It didn’t bother Nick. He thought they were right, and it made sense. Why should he care about the strangers dancers were usually called on to help? Their problems had nothing to do with him. When he’d danced before, he’d been doing it for money or favors.\n\nHe opened his mouth to say it was different this time because it was Alan, but they were all looking at him, and he couldn’t think of a way to say it. He shut his mouth.\n\n“Come, child,” Merris said briskly. “We will test your speed and reflexes. We’ll see if you would make a dancer.”\n\nSin reached out and grasped Mae’s hand. The other girl dancers moved to form a fluttering crowd about Merris, like bees attending the queen, and they moved away from the lights in a group. They all looked coldly at Nick as they went past.\n\nApparently Sin did not appreciate being glared at. Well, what did it matter? He’d made his decision about her already. Dad wouldn’t have approved of him getting mixed up with a Goblin Market girl, someone who might have guessed the truth about Mum, and Sin shouldn’t look at Alan like that.\n\nMaybe dancing with Mae wouldn’t be so bad, he thought suddenly. At least she was decent to his brother.\n\nHis gaze fell on Jamie, who was looking decidedly nervous about Mae’s sudden departure.\n\n“Don’t mind Merris, she always acts like that around me,” he said. He figured jokes were the only language this boy understood, and added, “She tries so hard to hide her attraction. Her mouth says, ‘I cannot imagine what they all see in you’ but her eyes say, ‘Take me, wild stallion.’ She’ll be back. She can’t keep away.”\n\nJamie smiled, looking a little startled.\n\n“You’re not allowed to be a wild stallion until you’re older,” said Alan, but he caught Nick’s eye and smiled crookedly at him, looking very pleased.\n\nAlan cared so much about kindness.\n\nThe dancers returned, bearing the platters of red and golden fruit to lay around the circles. The fruit formed bright circles around the dancing circles, rings laid within rings. The lights of the Market danced over the fruit and made it gleam.\n\nFever fruit was grown from small trees carefully nurtured in the caravans of the Market folk. For a long time they looked like nothing but dry sticks in little pots, shriveled and dead, but every tree had a day of blooming like a butterfly. Then the tree was garlanded with blossoms, their colors bright as ribbons on a maypole, and under the rich colors the fever fruit grew. They were gold and scarlet, like apples to bite into but with a single poisonous stone at the core, and they had the heavy exotic smell of expensive perfumes.\n\nOnce anyone tasted fever fruit, it became their favorite food.\n\nNick gave Alan his new sword to hold, took one of the fever fruit, and bit into it. The skin broke at the first light touch of teeth, and juice burst thick and sweet on his tongue.\n\n“Don’t eat those,” Alan advised Jamie, stopping the boy’s reach. “They’re kept for the dancers. The dances used to be called bacchanals once, and nobody measured the amount of fruit they should eat. After the dance was done, the dancers were let loose on the world. Sometimes they killed people.”\n\n“I think I’ve read about that,” Jamie said. “The dancers, they were called maenads. The wild women.”\n\nThe juice of the fever fruit coursed down Nick’s throat in a thick stream as he ate, like the blood in his veins, quickening everything, making him feel better about everything. Maybe he’d dance with Mae and like it, maybe she would fail the tests and he’d dance with Sin. One thing was certain: Either way, he would cure Alan. He laughed and Jamie looked alarmed at the sound. Nick grinned at him and realized he was not grinning so much as baring his teeth.\n\nHe pitched his voice low. “Not just women.”\n\nMore dancers started to gather around the fruit, taking a piece for themselves. Laughter and a humming sort of energy started to rise from their little group, and a larger group gathered to surround them. Dancing was just another part of the Market, since most of the dancers were dancing for pay, for strangers who needed help or information, but it was also the closest thing to entertainment the Goblin Market had to offer.\n\nBesides, Nick was going to dance again. They all knew it would be a good show.\n\nA lot of the time, dancers would dance through their steps, and no demon would show, but they never failed to come for Nick.\n\n“Who’s Anzu?” Jamie asked. “Nick said he was going to call him.”\n\n“Two demons have given Nick their names so he can call on them,” Alan answered. “Demons can do and show themselves as almost anything, but mostly they have preferred forms and ways of doing things. There are the ones Mae would call succubi and incubi, who try to appeal to people romantically, there are those who show themselves wearing the faces of the dead, there are the ones who favor a particular animal. The demons Nick calls are Anzu, who often takes a bird shape, and a succubus called Liannan who — well.” Alan glanced over at Nick, who smiled at him and waved a hand for him to go on. “Demons don’t have a very good sense of time,” Alan went on. “Liannan thinks Nick is a boyfriend of hers from a while ago.”\n\nThey were starting to light torches and chant to prepare the circle for opening. Torchlight caught Alan’s hair and changed it from the color of blood in the dark into bright gold.\n\nJamie looked stunned. “A boyfriend? I thought demons were evil!”\n\nAlan frowned. “Well, it’s up for debate. Some of us argue they are, and of course Liannan would have been ready to take her boyfriend’s body and his life. You can’t trust them, not for a second, because they are so desperate to get into this world, but — some people think that not all their feelings are simulated to trick us. They are very different from us. It’s hard to tell, but some people think…” Alan’s voice softened, and he admitted, “I think — that they can love.”\n\nNick thought that if a succubus ever got to Alan, he would probably want to take her out to dinner and talk about her feelings before he’d accept any dark demonic delights.\n\nThe torches were burning steadily in brackets set on the trees around them. The circles were done, and the plates of fever fruit were emptying. Nick felt like he was separate from his body and still trying to keep it steady. Light was brimming and refracting in his vision as if he was seeing it underwater. Girls and boys with sticky fingers and sticky mouths crowded around him, laughing and asking him why he was dancing again. Alan, the fixed point in a whirling world, stayed close and answered for Nick. He would be asking questions for Nick soon enough.\n\nThe drums started the dancing rhythm, a low, muffled sound that seemed to begin in his bones. They always had to muffle the drums in case someone heard them, but all the sounds of the night were distinct in Nick’s ears suddenly — the sound of a woman spreading her cards on a stall, the sound of small, frightened animals in the wood.\n\nThe light step of a girl, behind him. Nick spun and saw Mae.\n\n“Good news,” announced Merris Cromwell. “We have found a most promising new dancer.”\n\nNick laughed, and Merris regarded him coldly. “She fulfills all the requirements. She has good coordination, she has a strong desire to call the demons, and she has no fear.”\n\n“She’ll be afraid enough in a minute,” Nick murmured.\n\n“Want to bet?”\n\nMae strode past Nick to the nearest dish of fruit and seized one as if she was picking up a gauntlet someone had thrown. When she bit into it, the juice ran in a golden stream down her chin.\n\nHer eyes met Nick’s, and his hand went to his belt. He unbuckled his old sword and scabbard, and tossed them aside. He wasn’t going to back down from a challenge.\n\n“Let’s dance,” he said.\n\nAs Mae cut her circle under Merris’s direction, he turned to Alan, who offered him the shell. It gleamed i S. Iwidn pale seashell colors, blue and violet and apricot in the Goblin Market lights, and then it was white once more. Nick kissed it, put the speaking charm around Alan’s neck, and then stepped into the circle of summoning.\n\nNick’s talisman flared in a sudden moment of pure pain. Nick tilted his head back and absorbed the shock, let it wash over him like water, and listened through the feeling of pain and rising magic for his brother’s voice.\n\n“I call on the demon they called Anzu in Sumer!” Alan said as the sound of the drums came faster and faster. “I call on the demon they called Djehuty in Egypt! I call on the demon the Romans called the thief at the gates and the watcher by night. As they called him, so I call him: I call on Anzu!”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐừng bỏ qua chiếc đồng hồ bản sao Omega này khi nó giảm 90%\nWatchthuysichinhhang\nHết đau trĩ, bệnh cấp độ 4 cũng phải teo với thứ này\nSuckhoevungcao"

Dùng ngay\nElectric Saving Box\n\nMae must have entered the circle beside him when Nick had entered his, but Nick had no awareness of her now. Partners or not, she would dance or fall on her own.\n\nThe drums surged and pounded in his temples, and he stepped along the lines for communication. The lines of traveling began to whirl as if they really were the spokes of a wheel, and he had to keep up with them. There was a cold, well-known touch all along his side, a seductive and almost familiar voice whispering to him, and in his other ear the call of “Come buy!” spiked into an appeal to stay, a promise of warmth in this world. He side-stepped neatly, never going too far to meet the demons; he twisted and spun in the center of sound and color and set lines.\n\nThere were thin screams of approval all around him. Arms reached out for him. Some were human, and he let them reach him. They pressed warm hands against his body, against his face, and the fever fruit was pressed again to his lips. He bit down and the world was bright around him, like a glass sculpture on the very edge of a mantelpiece, catching the light before it fell. He put his body between the worlds, threw back his head and put the straining muscles of his shoulders, the twisting strength of his hips, put his heart and his clenched hands at the service of the demon, and then held firm.\n\nNick always had to wait for his partner to catch up. He waited with his heart slamming against his chest and his throat raw with every breath, the world in a glow from fever fruit.\n\nFor a moment all he registered was that Mae was doing well for a beginner. Her steps along the weaving were sure, and she was making the right gestures of offering and appeal. Then he saw the fall of her skirt against her leg, the gleam of the chain around her stomach in the firelight. He saw her hands sliding like a lover’s hands down her own throat as she tipped her head back, and he realized that he could want her, after all.\n\nHe realized that he did want her.\n\nThere was no time to think about that, since at the point where their two circles intersected there was a cold light burning, racing along the patterns of the weaving but growing stronger and stronger at the point where it had started. Until the light gave birth to a dull red bonfire, and at the center of the red chill a shape formed.\n\nAnzu was taking the shape of a man today, though there was a suggestion of the eagle in the curve of his nose, a glint and pattern like crimson feathers about his golden hair. The fair skin he had chosen to wear was reddened by the dull glow of the fire around him, and when he lifted his eyes to Nick’s face, they were enormous, and clear as water.\n\nNick saw his own face reflected in those e Stedormyes, black eyes and black hair, a face far colder and more grim than the demon’s face before him. That was Anzu’s intention, of course.\n\n“Nick, isn’t it?” Anzu asked, pronouncing Nick’s name as if it was rather a good joke. “Well, well. Dancing again, are we?”\n\n“Our pair danced for you and you fed off their feelings. You owe us some service, Anzu,” said Alan.\n\nAnzu peered out past the circle. “Ah,” he said, looking even more amused. “It’s Alan, isn’t it? The one who knows so much. What service do you require?”\n\nA new voice broke through the sound of drums and the sizzle of the flame.\n\n“I want to save my brother,” said Mae, clear and confident. “He has a third-tier mark. How can I do that?”\n\nAnzu laughed. “You can’t,” he answered. “He’s ours now. It’s only a matter of time.” His great glass-colored eyes traveled to Jamie’s face. “So young,” he remarked, smiling wickedly at Mae. “We do like them young.”\n\nHe turned and grinned at Nick. Nick saw sparks pinwheel around Anzu’s head and take flight in the shape of tiny birds.\n\nAlan hesitated, his face grave, but Nick’s brother knew better than to leave a pause for a demon to misinterpret.\n\n“I have a first-tier mark,” he said quietly. “Can you remove it?”\n\n“Oh, of course,” Anzu replied. “Washing you clean would be my pleasure. Can’t have you leaving that little family of yours. What would they do without you? Put the mark in the flame.”\n\nAlan knelt with some difficulty on the grass and rolled up his jeans. He extended his leg into the circle, making sure it was lifted well above the pattern of the weaving, and held it in the center of the fire.\n\nThe fire did not burn him, but its sullen glow lit up his leg so the first mark stood out dark against his skin, the two slashes forming a doorway. The shadows lurking in them were so deep that it looked like they were welling with fresh blood.\n\n“Hmm,” said Anzu. “That’s interesting.”\n\nAlan’s voice was clipped. “Explain.”\n\n“Oh — it’s nothing,” Anzu said. “Only that your mark”—he nodded to Alan—“and the young thing’s mark were made by the same Circle. The Obsidian Circle. And they were made by the same demon.”\n\n“What does that mean?” Alan demanded.\n\n“A small thing,” Anzu told him. “It means that if you agreed, I could transfer one of the young thing’s marks onto you instead. That would mean you would both be bearing a second-tier mark, which still means death for someone. If you caught and sacrificed two magicians of the Obsidian Circle, then you would both live. It is the only chance the boy has, but it would be a terrible risk for you to take.” Anzu waved a careless hand, fingers blending into the flame. Nick could almost see talons. “Forget I mentioned it.”\n\n“Wait,” said Alan.\n\nNick had kissed the speaking charm and given his voice into Alan’s keeping a hundred times, and he had never missed his voice. It was almost peaceful, having no words, having Alan speak for them both, but now Nick had something to say. It felt as if smoke had got caught in his throat, or the lack of words was scorching him. He moved his mouth, moved his tongue with a painful effort, and found his whole body empty of words when he needed them most.\n\nMae had words. She looked at Alan and she said simply, “Please.”\n\nNick knew that while he was within the circle, Anzu could feel a little of what he felt. Even though Nick could not speak, even though he knew that his own face rarely betrayed much emotion, Anzu looked at Nick as Mae spoke and Nick was sure Anzu knew everything Nick could not say. In turn, Nick thought he could feel just a touch of the demon’s malicious delight.\n\nNo, Nick thought, his whole body thrumming with that single word. He wanted to shout it. No.\n\nAlan cleared his throat and said, “All right.”\n\nStill looking at Nick, still grinning, Anzu reached out one of those hands that blurred into talons, and with a talon he stabbed Alan three times as deep as he could.\n\nHe drew the second mark, which meant death, onto the skin of Nick’s brother.\n\n6\n\nThe Hunt Begins\n\nAS SOON AS THE BALEFIRE DIED AND THE DEMON WENT down in smoke, Nick broke out of the circle in one stride. He was beside Alan in another step, one fist clenched in Alan’s shirt and one closing around the speaking charm. He ripped the charm violently from Alan’s neck and took a savage satisfaction in seeing the thin red line spring up on Alan’s skin when the chain broke.\n\nHe stamped on the shell and felt as if he had bitten his tongue and blood was filling his mouth, slipping down his throat. Only instead of blood, it was his voice.\n\nNow that he could speak, he found he had nothing to say. It was done.\n\nNick shoved Alan away, sending him stumbling back into the ash and the broken pattern of the demon’s circle. Alan was easy to throw off balance. If Nick had thrown him back with any more force, he would have fallen, and if he’d fallen, Nick might have kicked him when he was down.\n\nA crowd of people had gathered to watch the dance, and now they were all gaping like the idiots they were. Even those idiots were not stupid enough to get in Nick’s way. He stormed forward, and they scattered in all directions before him. He plunged into the depths of the wood, away from the noise and lights of the Goblin Market into a raging darkness. Branches caught in the night wind whipped at him, twigs raking his face.\n\nThere was a sharp burn in the corner of one eye and a trail of heat down his cheek. Of course, it was blood.\n\nNick wiped at his eye and saw the lurid smear of blood on his knuckles, red even in the darkness. He wanted every trace of the fever fruit burned out of his system. The fruit made even this dark wood too bright. It made the wind and shadows into whispers and lurking thorns.\n\nHe turned at every sound, wanting to lash out at something, but nobody was stupid enough to follow him. He was surprised when he heard the unmistakable sound behind him, a sound not of wind or branches but of a step, and he realized that somebody had been stupid enough to follow him, after all.\n\nHe wheeled around and it was not Alan.\n\nIt was Mae, coming toward him with her eyes wide and her whole face luminous with emotion. At first Nick thought she was just happy. She had every reason to be happy, after all, since Nick’s stupid brother had removed her stupid brother from immediate danger by risking himself.\n\nThen he remembered the fever fruit.\n\nMae’s eyes were a little too wide, her pupils dilated. Nick remembered how the world was after that first taste, how everything was magnified and glowing, every color breaking in on you like light, and every thought like a revelation.\n\n“What do you want?” Nick snapped.\n\nMae’s lips were slightly parted and quivering. She licked them, and with that fevered sharpness Nick saw the place on her mouth where her tongue had rubbed away the lip gloss.\n\nShe came closer, put out her hand, and pushed Nick against a tree. Her lips quivered again, and she spoke.\n\n“I want,” said Mae, offering up her mouth. “Oh, I want…”\n\nShe lifted her free hand to pull Nick’s head down, fingers knotted in his hair. Nick remembered, with a vividness born of the fever fruit, the curve of Mae’s h*ps dancing. He could want her.\n\nAlan wanted her too. This would hurt Alan, and after Alan’s little stunt Nick liked the idea of hurting him.\n\nNick seldom said no to a girl, and he had never done so in circumstances like these, with the lights of the Goblin Market glimpsed like far-off lightning behind her and her trembling mouth an inch from his.\n\nNick touched her for the first time.\n\nHe took hold of her shoulders and pushed her away. Then he leaned forward and whispered into her ear.\n\n“You’d want anyone right now.”\n\nHe let his lips touch her ear and when he drew back, she did not look angry, only dazed and uncomprehending.\n\nHe left her. He did not want to run, because that would have looked like fear or some other ridiculous thing, so he loped through the woods, going easily, knowing that when he walked fast no girl and no crippled idiot could catch him. He held his hands clenched in fists, but he did not hit out at any thorns.\n\nWhen black night was touched with the cold, unfriendly blue of coming morning, Nick went back.\n\nThe Goblin Market was in the process of being packed away. The remnants of the stalls stood forlorn as their owners stored their wares in boxes, and the few customers left lingered uneasily around the debris of magic.\n\nThe others were standing in the center of the clearing, near a fortune-telling stall. Jamie was looking uneasily around and saw him at once. Mae was leaning against Alan, cheek pressed against his shoulder. As Nick came toward them, she made a determined effort to twine herself around Alan and turned her face up to his.\n\nIt seemed that, indeed, anyone would do.\n\nAlan stooped and gave her a soft kiss, light, but enough to show her she was not being rejected.\n\n“No, Mae, I really can’t. It would be taking advantage,” Alan was saying.\n\nThe fortune-teller picked this unfortunate moment to lean over her stall and pluck at Nick’s sleeve.\n\nHer crystal ball, left out in forlorn hope, stared up at Nick as if the woman had a huge third eye cupped between her palms. In the crystal depths, luminous points of green spiked like a tiny forest; above the green, streams of iridescent blue were looped like ribbons.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐây là gương mặt của tôi cách đây 5 ngày trước!

Merris Cromwell would have coldly recommended a cough drop.\n\nThe tightly interwoven blues and greens darkened. The impression Nick received was that of a shadow falling over a lake, a silhouette that grew more distinct, moving from a shadow into the lines of a face.\n\nIt was just his own face, his darkly reflected eyes staring out of the crystal.\n\nNick picked up the crystal in one hand and hurled it with vicious force at the nearest tree. The crash made Mae and Alan jump and look around. Nick caught their movement from the corner of his eye, but mostly he was staring at the glittering shards.\n\n“I think I’ve seen enough,” he said.\n\nThey dropped Mae and Jamie home, Alan giving strict instructions for Mae to be put to bed and kept there. Jamie made solemn promises and held Mae’s hand tight with the air of an anxious nanny.\n\n“You don’t need to worry,” he said, leaning into Alan’s open window. “And, er, Alan?” he added. “Thanks.”\n\nHe gave Alan a quick kiss on the cheek, and then disappeared through the gate with a struggling Mae in tow. It was rather a fancy gate, loops and swirls wrought in iron creating a picture Nick couldn’t quite make out. Through the intricate pattern he glimpsed an ivy-covered house, large and white, looming in the still-dark sky like a big expensive iceberg. The windows in the upper floors cast yellow light on the big garden and the tennis court.\n\nThese two had everything. They could have left Nick’s brother alone.\n\nNick crossed his arms over his chest and said stonily, “Quite a night you’re having.”\n\nAlan said, “I’m not talking to you while you still have the fever fruit in your system.”\n\nNot talking was fine by Nick. He stared out the window as Alan drove.\n\nUsually the journeys back from the Goblin Market were all right no matter how long they were. It was not like moving; it was just the two of them without Mum. Alan played classical or country music and talked for ages about whatever his latest craze was, from vintage comics to philosophy. It was all just insane ranting to Nick, but he didn’t mind hearing it, and he always bullied Alan into letting Nick drive most of the way home.\n\nThis time there was silence. Nick did not offer to drive at all. He measured exactly where the halfway point was and when it came, he did not speak. Let Alan tell him to drive. Let Alan take care of himself for a change. Nick glanced over at Alan and saw his jaw set. He was not going to ask Nick for help; he was too proud to ask for anything that was not offered willingly.\n\nNick was viciously glad. It was Alan’s own fault. Let him suffer.\n\nThey continued to drive in silence, except for the tiny hitches of breath that began to rise helplessly in Alan’s throat. Nick listened to every stifled sound of pain.\n\nAlan would never have let Nick hurt himself, no matter how angry with Nick he might have been. Nick knew that, but that was the difference between them. Nick was a jerk, and Alan was a suicidal fool.\n\nThe car drove into a lurid yellow morning, the terrible toxic color of leaden clouds filtering pale, sickly sunlight. There was a fine, continuous rain falling. Nick stared out at the wash of water down the glass and wondered if other people got as angry as he did. He’d seen Alan angry, but he’d never discovered in Alan’s eyes any savage urge for blood. He wished he wanted to yell at Alan or slam doors, wanted to do anything but lash out with extreme violence. He sat, fists clenched, too aware of the new sword at his belt and the knife against the small of his back.\n\nWhen they pulled up outside their house and the purr of the car engine stilled, Alan let his leg relax and breathed out a sigh of pure relief. For a moment there was complete quiet.\n\nThen Alan said, “While you were gone, I talked to Merris. She said she wouldn’t be able to help us with Black Arthur, but — I don’t know. I’ve heard stories about the experiments she does in her house. She won’t talk about them. What we need is an excuse to get into Merris’s house.”\n\nThat was just like Nick’s stupid brother, still worrying about Mum when he was the one in danger. What Nick needed was to get both marks off Alan, and that would be almost impossible.\n\n“We need to kill a magician,” Nick snarled.\n\nDad had been killed by the magicians. They had spent their whole life running from the magicians, and now they had to seek them out.\n\n“We’ve killed magicians before,” said Alan.\n\n“When they came for us,” Nick snapped. “They live in magicians’ Circles. If we try to deliberately find one, we’ll find a nest of them. They have demons, they have magic, and they outnumber us.”\n\nThese were the facts. Alan knew them, and it maddened Nick to have to enumerate them. He did not add the next fact, which was that Alan was probably going to die.\n\n“It’s a chance,” Alan said. “Jamie didn’t have a chance before. Now we both do.”\n\n“Why should he expect you to die for him?” Nick demanded. “What would I do with Mum if you were dead?”\n\n“I didn’t realize,” Alan said slowly, looking a little pale, “that your concern was so entirely practical.”\n\nNick stared at the dashboard. Alan was choosing now, of all times, to talk nonsense. Nick was in no mood for it.\n\n“You weren’t being noble,” he informed Alan after a moment. “You didn’t want to give anyone a chance. Don’t lie to me. Don’t tell me it had nothing to do with that girl!”\n\nBefore Alan could tell him anything, Nick had wrenched open the door. He leaped out and slammed it shut behind him. He ran as he hadn’t run through the wood at Tiverton, as if he were being chased, down the gray side streets of south London.\n\nHe ran to the new garage he was working at. Nick found comfort in machines that were either working or broken, and if broken could be either fixed or destroyed. He found the garage as still as a graveyard, cars in various stages of repair like sad metallic specters.\n\nNick kicked a box of tools and sent wrenches and spanners flying out onto the cement. He wanted to overturn a car, and he felt sure he could. He was so angry he wanted to kill.\n\nA car, winched up as high as it would go, collapsed with a crash behind him. Nick spun and drew his sword as a loose wheel rolled into the wall, and he noticed for the first time that the lock on the garage door was broken. Somebody or something had smashed it.\n\nNick was suddenly happy. He hoped this was an attack, that here at last was something he knew how to deal with. He turned in a slow circle, watching for a flicker of movement, for the slightest sound. Another car fell with a thunderous crash as soon as his back was turned.\n\n“Got you,” Nick said, turning on the sound with his sword already arcing through the air. All he saw was a lick of flame leaping under the bonnet of the car.\n\nIt was a demon. It had to be. The crash had not been enough to start a fire and besides, Nick’s talisman was a prickling, harshly humming weight against his chest. There was a demon, somewhere close, and it would not show itself so he could kill it!\n\nHe thought for a moment that he needed to go warn Alan so they could all start packing, but then he remembered. They were chasing demons now. If there were magicians here, they had to stay and hunt them.\n\nHe should really go, he realized. He didn’t need to be caught and laid off for setting fires.\n\n“So,” he said to the dying flame and the empty room, “I’ll get you later.”\n\nHe did not feel like going home, so he took a walk, and then returned to work, where everyone was wondering who the mystery vandals were. Nick nodded to all the theories, and then popped a car bonnet and got down to work. He worked grimly and silently, two shifts, until it was dark and someone told him to get out and enjoy what was left of his night.\n\nNick just nodded a final time and left. He went home at last and got into bed without seeing anyone. Sleep, black and consuming, swallowed him whole.\n\nHe woke late as usual and came downstairs to find Alan playing with a piece of toast. He looked pale and worn as an old bone, after only one night with a second-tier mark. There were violet shadows under his eyes, and he did not look up from his plate as Nick approached. Nick could usually sneak up on anyone but Alan. He went over to lean his forearms on the back of Alan’s chair and frowned at the back of Alan’s neck.\n\n“Don’t,” he said, and saw Alan jump at the unexpected word, so close, and then relax. “Don’t do anything like this again,” he said. “All right?”\n\nAlan reached behind him and grasped Nick’s upper arm. His thin fingers only half closed around the swell of muscle, but he held on.\n\n“I promise I won’t put any demon marks on myself for the sake of any fetching pink-haired girls or their brothers ever again.”\n\nNick hung over Alan’s chair, uneasy but not exactly wanting to break away, and said in a rough voice, “You’d better not.”\n\nAlan offered to run him to school, but Nick said he’d take the Tube. He knew Alan must really be tired when he agreed. Nick had no intention of going to school. He knew what he had to do.\n\nAnzu had given him the name of a Circle. The Obsidian Circle: Black Arthur’s Circle. He knew that much, but he did not know how much power they had or where to find them. He did not have time to wait for the next Goblin Market. He could draw a basic circle of summoning. He would dance again and alone.\n\nHe needed answers. He needed his other demon.\n\nHe needed Liannan.\n\nOn one of the bleakest roads in Camden, there was a small gray lot behind the American Methodist Church. It was filled with builder’s dust and rubble years old, and there was a large metal Dumpster in it that was heaped with an assortment of rubbish.\n\nOn a Monday morning Nick didn’t think he would be disturbed here.\n\nHe drew the circle of summoning and confinement carefully with a white piece of chalk he had stolen from an art shop on the way. He’d taken a few protective charms from Alan’s bedroom, and he laid them carefully at intervals around the circle. The circle had to be secure. He was taking risks, but he would not take that risk. If a demon ever got out into the world, free of a magician’s control, it could mean the end of the world.\n\nNick was planning to take risks only with himself. He had no fever fruit, he had no dance partner, and he had never spoken directly to a demon before. If he slipped up, the demon would have him. If he could not manage to offer something she wanted, Liannan might not even come.\n\nHe was betting that she would come. She had always seemed like she wanted to come to him.\n\nShe was not a woman, of course. That was only a shape she chose to trick humans, but Nick thought it would be easier if he could pretend she was a woman. He had called girls to him before. There was nothing so easy whether you were walking into a classroom, a club, or down the street. All you had to do was send out the right signals, give her the right look, turn your body the right way, and never for a moment let it cross your mind that she might not be interested.\n\nNick was not carrying his sword, so he laid down his knives before he entered the circle. It was a gesture. He was surrendering and inviting the demon in.\n\nHe could not let himself worry about scuffing the chalk marks that showed the lines of communication, or the lines that meant the boundaries between the worlds. If he got distracted from the dance, she would never come.\n\nPushing away the reality of a gray sky in London, he thought about night, the taste of fever fruit, and the taste of a girl’s mouth. He thought about being in a nightclub and catching a girl’s eyes gleaming under the colored, moving lights. He thought about Mae’s skin under the lanterns of the Goblin Market.\n\nThe right words were, as ever, the hardest part. He swallowed and heard his voice come out rough, commanding a girl rather than coaxing her. That worked, sometimes.\n\n“I call on the one who gave me the name Liannan! I call on she who loves water and lives in ice, she who follows men invisible and drives them mad. I call on the face men follow through a winter storm to their deaths. I call on Liannan.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nViêm họng cấp/mãn tính,không biết cách này để chữa thì quá phí\nArgelomag\nNgười thợ 40 tuổi vui mừng vì thoát khỏi cánh cửa ung thư gan"

He danced and remembered fighting, training his aching body until he knew only the desire for perfection, the perfect kill, the perfect kiss. He threw back his head, arched his back, and called Liannan to his side.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, there was nothing but the tarmac, the worn building, and the chalk outlines of what looked like a child’s game. Nick waited for a heartbeat, despaired for a breath, and then saw pale fire building from one chalked-in line.\n\nIt was a very pale fire, almost colorless, as if water had learned how to burn. Liannan rose from a high flame the color of a fountain with her head bowed, like a goddess rising from the sea. The fire settled over the circle, lapping gently as the sea at low tide around them, and she stood before Nick and lifted her face to his.\n\nHis talisman sent a pang of sheer agony through his body, and he gave a quick gasp. She smiled.\n\nShe was smiling; she who was a legend in lands where men would follow her into ice and shadow for a smile. She was dazzling, and she would have been even more beautiful if she had not been so pale. Pallor lay over her like a veil, making the color of her eyes impossible to distinguish and cooling the fire of her red hair, as if the vivid color was seen under frost.\n\n“It’s been a long time,” she said, her voice ringing like the chimes at the Goblin Market.\n\nNick crossed his arms and stared at her. The less he spoke, the less chance there was she could trick him.\n\nLiannan tilted her head. “Do you like this?” she asked. “I remember you always had a fancy for red hair.”\n\nNick actually preferred blondes, but that hardly mattered. She thought he was a different man, centuries dead, and probably dead by her hand. Demons found it hard to tell humans apart.\n\n“It’s all right,” Nick said grudgingly. “I have two questions for you. I know I didn’t dance with a partner or take the fruit. Tell me your price for answering them.”\n\n“My price.” Liannan’s voice changed to a whisper that sounded like a waterfall. “I will answer one question — if you take off your talisman.”\n\nEvery dancer always wore a talisman, because a demon could mark you if you were in a circle, as easily as they could take a mark off you, if you did not wear some protection.\n\n< if\"0 %\">\n\nIf he refused, though, she would go. She had chosen her shape, and it was a shape to seduce rather than to force. He could stop her if she tried to mark him.\n\nNick nodded, and for the first time in eight years, he took off his talisman and cast it to one side.\n\nLosing the talisman should have made him feel vulnerable, but he felt nothing but relief. He always carried the talisman and thought of what had happened to Alan without one. He carried it and bore with the endless prickling discomfort, the pain doubled whenever a demon was near or spells were performed in his presence. He was free of pain at last, and he felt wonderful.\n\nThis new freedom made him feel more confident rather than less. He didn’t need any warning. He could deal with demons on his own.\n\nHe looked at Liannan and smiled. A smile spread over her face in return, a sad, beautiful smile, with just the faintest gleam of sharp teeth.\n\nShe reached out for him, her fingers shining like knives. They were icicles.\n\n“I can touch you now,” she said.\n\nIf he tried to fight her, Nick might accidentally step out of the circle. He let her touch him. It wasn’t so bad, since she looked like a girl. She might have been any girl, with her slim body pressed against his, her eyes fixed beseechingly on his face. One hand was curled around his neck, her fingers sharp and cold.\n\n“Ask me your question.”\n\n“Where are the Obsidian Circle?”\n\nShe didn’t answer him. That would have been too easy.\n\nNick could see the demon’s breath, as if she were a child puffing out warm clouds into the cold air, but her breath against his cheek was icy.\n\n“The Obsidian Circle,” she repeated thoughtfully. “That was the Circle that hunted you first. That was the Circle that wanted you most.”\n\n“Tell me something I don’t know,” Nick snapped.\n\n“All right,” Liannan said, and laughed. “Did you know that was the Circle that killed a man called Daniel Ryves?”\n\nNick thought of being eight years old and watching his father fall to ash.\n\n“This Circle has something to pay for, then,” he said. “I’m glad you told me. I’ll be glad to kill them. Now, where are they?”\n\n“Exeter,” said Liannan. “But you won’t find them there. They’re leaving soon.”\n\nHow like a demon to give an answer that was completely true and utterly useless. Liannan must have seen some of Nick’s fury in his face. It made her laugh.\n\nShe had two rows of pointed teeth like a shark. They all flashed when she laughed, and she swayed closer to him. Her mouth was the color of frozen cherries.\n\n“What is it like, being human?” she asked. “I cannot imagine what it must be like, to feel the blood warm in your veins and the sun warm on your face. Will you tell me that you love me?”\n\n“I don’t love you,” said Nick. “I don’t even know you, demon.”\n\n“You did know me once.”\n\n“Did I?” Nick asked. “When was that, exactly? A hundred years ago? More?”\n\n“Something like that,” Liannan murmured.\n\n“How do you think humans work?”\n\nShe had no eyelashes, like any reptile or underwater thing. She only looked like a human at first glance, before you noticed that small details were wrong.\n\n“I have no idea,” she answered, and lifted her free hand to touch his face.\n\nThe cold burned and numbed him to the pain. He did not even feel a sting when the icicles cut him, only blood trickling down his cheek. She put her mouth to his face, her lips cold but very soft. When she leaned back, her mouth looked warmer, and she trailed her hand down Nick’s chest. His shirt tore under her sharp fingers.\n\nHer clasp around his neck, more palm than icicle fingers, was firm. It was as if she thought he might try to get away.\n\n“Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Nick asked.\n\n“I hope not,” she said. “There is something else I think you should know. Anzu is working for the Obsidian Circle.”\n\n“Oh, so I shouldn’t trust him,” Nick said. “In future, I should only summon you.”\n\nLiannan nodded.\n\nNick laughed. “Demons work for anyone who can call them,” he said. “Do you think I don’t know that? Do you think I don’t know better than to trust any demon? Don’t try to play your tricks on me. I have another question. Name your price.”\n\nLiannan sighed like a tired child and rested her head on his shoulder. He felt her chilly breath running down the back of his neck, making him shiver every time she spoke.\n\n“My dear,” she said. “My darling, my beloved. What do these words mean? I suppose you know now.”\n\n“I know.”\n\nNick meant his tone to be brutal, meant it to turn the words into an offense, but the demon lifted a face to him that was as radiant as sunlight on miles of snow.\n\n“I want some warmth to take back with me,” she whispered, her voice an icy breeze. “Surely you remember — a time when you were warm.”\n\n“That’s your price?” Nick asked, to seal the bargain.\n\n“That’s my price,” said Liannan. “A moment of your life.”\n\nIf he failed to pay the price, she could take anything she wanted.\n\n“Tell me where the Obsidian Circle are going,” Nick said. “And you can take it.”\n\nThe demon nodded and stood on tiptoe to press her soft, cold mouth to Nick’s. Nick shut his eyes and tried, as her kiss chilled him and her icicle fingers scrabbled against his skin, to think of a time when he had been warm.\n\nHe shivered, struggled against panic, and remembered being cold.\n\nLiannan had mentioned his father. Perhaps it was that which reminded Nick of the time right after they had lost him. They were living in Scotland then, in the smallest, cheapest flat Alan had been able to find. Alan, injured and unable to walk, was not sure how to make Mum go out to work, and their heat had been cut off in the middle of winter.\n\nThrough the thin walls, Nick heard Alan crying every night. Nick had not been sure if he was supposed to cry too. He had never cried in his life, and he did not particularly want to do it now. He just lay curled in bed, his mind ticking bleakly over all these new facts. He was eight years old, his father was dead, his brother was crippled, and he was so cold.\n\nHe was huddled under the blankets, thinking about it all, when his brother limped in and carefully heaped his own blankets over Nick’s bed. Nick stared silently up at Alan’s face, pale and tired, marked with new lines of pain. His glasses were too big for him and kept tilting off. Alan had smiled at him determinedly and crawled in under the covers, sliding his arm around Nick. Alan had been bigger than Nick back then, big enough so that Nick felt a little shielded from a world that had turned unfriendly, and Alan’s body and the new blankets made him start to feel warm.\n\nAlan had reached out and smoothed Nick’s rumpled hair. “You’re mine,” he said, in a trembling young voice that already had a ring of Dad’s about it. “And I’m going to take care of you.”\n\nIt was a memory of warmth, after all.\n\nLiannan leaned back, her lips parted. Her eyes were shining like ice under moonlight. “Thank you,” she said.\n\nThen she put her winter-cold mouth to his ear and whispered, “No need to go looking for them. They’ll be in London in nine days. Didn’t you guess? The whole Circle is coming for you.”\n\nNick came home afterward feeling like a gutted fish, limp and neatly filleted. His mouth felt bruised from the cold, and he did not want to tell Alan what he had learned.\n\nAlan took one look at him and shut his eyes.\n\n“Missing school again,” he said, putting aside his book. “How am I supposed to bring you up right if you won’t cooperate?”\n\n“Dunno,” Nick said, and stretched himself out on the couch with his head near Alan’s good leg. Alan looked worriedly down at his face and torn clothes.\n\n“So you’ve obviously had a fight — with some of the hyenas that have been menacing the streets of London. And you got roughed up.”\n\n“You should see the hyenas,” Nick said, and shut his eyes.\n\nThere were sounds upstairs. Mum must be feeling particularly lively today; Nick hoped this would not be one of the times she started to scream and would not stop.\n\n“Er,” Alan said, and Nick heard the note of unease in his voice. “Before I bring you antiseptic—”\n\n“And a sandwich.”\n\n“There’s something you should know.”\n\nBefore Alan could tell him what he should know, Nick knew. There were footsteps coming down the stairs, and the door to the sitting room swung open to reveal Mae, with Jamie peeping nervously over her shoulder.\n\nNick rose in one movement, barely checking a snarl. He hated to be caught at a disadvantage at any time, let alone at a time when two people, who had caused him enough trouble already, decided to invade his home.\n\n“They arrived about half an hour ago,” Alan explained. “Jamie has to be there for the kill. It does make sense….”\n\nNick did not think having strangers in his home made sense at all, and he was about to say so when Mae stepped forward, lifting her velvety brown eyes to his face.\n\n“What happened to you?” she asked.\n\n“Since you ask,” Nick snapped, “I was gathering some information. The Obsidian Circle is coming for us.”\n\nAlan looked troubled. The Obsidian Circle had been in Exeter, had been hunting them, and had come close enough to send ravens and snakes.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nViêm họng cấp/mãn tính,không biết cách này để chữa thì quá phí\nArgelomag\nNgười thợ 40 tuổi vui mừng vì thoát khỏi cánh cửa ung thư gan"

Every circle they made was a reflection of that one, and if the whole Obsidian Circle was really coming to London, they would have to bring their chunks of obsidian with them. Nick couldn’t imagine how any charm of Mum’s could have enough power to justify risking the circle the magicians were named after.\n\nThe Obsidian Circle was more committed to hunting them than he had dreamed.\n\n“They’re coming in full force,” Nick continued. “They’re hunting us. How are we supposed to hunt them?”\n\nAlan was as pale as he’d been when the messenger came, but he looked calm, and when he answered his voice was thoughtful.\n\n“If Black Arthur is hunting us, his magicians should be easy to find.”\n\n“And what’s to stop him getting to Mum while we go after his people?”\n\nNick would have sacrificed Mum to save Alan, every time. That wasn’t what was bothering him.\n\nThis was…all wrong. Less than a fortnight ago, Alan had said that no matter what he had to do, he would make Black Arthur pay, and now it looked as though he wanted to play right into Black Arthur’s hands. He should have suggested sending Mum away. He should be telling Nick his plans. He should stop hiding things from Nick!\n\n“I have a plan,” said Alan, and did not say what it was.\n\nNick did not ask. He started to and then stopped, as it occurred to him that his brother might actually lie.\n\nIt had always been a comfort to him that Alan could lie so well. Nick could not do it; the world was complicated enough without making up another world of words that weren’t even true. He had always assumed that Alan never lied to him, and now the idea that Alan might lie, might already be lying, was like being asked to read in school. He felt panicked, not knowing what to say. He had a picture of words stacked up around him, caging him in, and not one of them could he trust.\n\nHe stood silent, feeling like an animal held at bay. Mae and Jamie were staring at him, their eyes traveling over his ripped and bloodstained clothes.\n\nHis brother looked sad and kind, but then, Alan never looked kinder than when he was lying to someone. “Will you just do what I ask you to for now, Nick?”\n\nNick remembered that hidden photograph, those hidden letters, and now this secret plan. He thought of Christmas in the dark, and Alan coming back, opening the door with the light behind him.\n\n“Do I have any other choice?” he growled.\n\nAlan nodded at him, and then let his gaze drop. The shallow gashes Liannan’s icicles had left in Nick’s shoulders stung, and his mouth ached with cold. He suddenly felt very tired. He’d done what he could, and he had no idea what Alan was doing.\n\nHe’d carry out Alan’s little plan, even if he was in the dark. This was his brother. He had no one else.\n\n“So — can we stay?” asked Jamie tentatively, as if this was a visit instead of an invasion.\n\n“Stay if you like,” Nick snarled, too tired to argue. He strode past them to the stairs, pulling off his bloody shirt as he went, and threw a warning over his shoulder. “Just make sure you keep away from me.”\n\n7\n\nThe Intruders\n\nNICK WAS NOT USED TO LIVING WITH ANYONE BUT ALAN. Mum hardly counted, since it was best if she never saw Nick.\n\nHe didn’t like it, even though Mae and Jamie proved to be quite useful. They were willing to pore over Alan’s books and scrolls for hours, trying to get information about the Obsidian Circle. They tried to memorize the few pictures of Obsidian Circle magicians that Alan had drawn from descriptions he’d been able to get from Market people. They chipped in for groceries, and Jamie honestly tried to help with the cooking. Alan offered to give up his own room to them, but Nick insisted that they take his instead. He wanted Alan to keep the bookcase.\n\nSharing a room was fine by Nick. The second mark meant that demons could send Alan dreams every night. Nick had to watch and wake Alan if he seemed restless.\n\nThe cloud of Black Arthur and his message hung over their house. He was coming for their mother, and their mother knew it.\n\nThere were small magical incidents throughout the house these days, lights unexpectedly coming on and strange noises. Alan said that it meant Mum was scared, but Nick didn’t care. He didn’t need these reminders of his magician mother everywhere in the house; the magic felt like another intruder.\n\nAlan liked the human intrusions. Both of them.\n\nAlan liked reading books with Mae, and he loved that she wanted to learn the Greek alphabet. He fancied her, Nick could understand that, and if it hadn’t been for Nick’s uneasiness about what idiot thing his brother might do next, he might have been all right with that. But Alan seemed to like having Jamie around too.\n\nHe and Jamie watched television and listened to music together, and Alan was trying to teach him the difference between cooking things and burning them.\n\nNick was not sure why that bothered him, and then he realized that if Alan was this ready to welcome strangers into their home, he must be very lonely.\n\nNick had no idea what to do about that. He just wanted them to go away.\n\n“Won’t your parents be wanting you back?” he asked when he came home from school on the third day, slinging down his bag and pulling his horrible tie over his head.\n\nJamie, who was attempting chips and something that looked like French toast, gave Nick a slightly apprehensive glance as usual.\n\n“Well,” he said cautiously, “they don’t know we’re gone.”\n\nNick strode over to the fridge, grabbed the milk, and took a swig. Alan would have seriously objected to him drinking out of the carton, but Jamie just kept watching him warily, as if he thought he might have to dodge at any moment.\n\n“How did you pull that one off? If you have an evil twin, you should send him over,” Nick said, leaning against the fridge. “I might like him.”\n\nJamie’s face closed down in what Nick could tell was a trained performance, telling a story he’d had to tell a lot and pretending he didn’t care. Nick didn’t lie, but he’d learned to recognize the signs of lies in others. The world was filled with clumsy liars, amateurs who didn’t realize how they looked to other people and didn’t work to perfect the act.\n\nNick could always tell, except with Alan.\n\n“Our parents are divorced,” Jamie said with false airiness. “They split up about seven years ago, but it took a while for the divorce to come through. They’re both…society types; they have a lot of money and it was all tangled up. It was a pretty acrimonious divorce. They both wanted most of the assets and less time with the kids.”\n\nJamie tried to smile. Apparently he made jokes when he was upset as well as when he was afraid. Nick just stared at him, and after a moment Jamie started talking again.\n\n“Mum got the house, Dad got the holiday home, and they got joint custody. They both thought they got ripped off. It’s easy enough to call them and say you’re spending extra time with the other one. They can’t check. They don’t talk, and anyway — they’re glad to be rid of us. Even if they did find out we were gone, they’d think Mae took me to one of the raves she sneaks off to sometimes. So.”\n\nSo that explained some things. It explained why the demon had gone for Jamie in the first place. The magicians didn’t dare let the demons out often or at random, since secrecy was as important to them as it was to the Market. Demons had to choose victims who were alone and unprotected, whose disappearance would not be noticed soon, and parents usually noticed rather quickly if a child disappeared or turned up possessed. Not these parents, obviously.\n\nIt explained Mae’s rebellion, created to punish her parents or get their attention, and explained the way Jamie was, caught young in the middle of a domestic war, just trying to stay out of trouble. Look how well that had worked out for him.\n\nNick could understand it, but he wasn’t sure how he was supposed to respond to it.\n\n“So the magicians knew you wouldn’t be missed,” he said.\n\nThat didn’t seem to be right. Jamie went very white.\n\n“I suppose they might think that,” he said. “Mum’s very busy, and I don’t think being a single parent is the type of life she had planned. I don’t think we’re the type of kids she wanted. She never means to be unkind.”\n\nWhen Mum was in her screaming fits, she sometimes hit out. Alan had gotten black eyes that way. Mum never meant to hurt him, but there it was.\n\n“What is that?” Nick asked abruptly, staring at the pan.\n\n“I don’t know,” Jamie answered, stirring the unidentifiable mass with a helpless air. “It was meant to be omelets.”\n\n“I thought it was French toast.”\n\n“It sort of looks like brains,” Jamie remarked sadly.\n\nThey both regarded the pan for a moment, and then Nick came to a decision.\n\n“All right, push over. I can fix this. You go grate some cheese.”\n\nJamie squinted up at him. “You’re going to fix this?” he repeated, and looked extremely doubtful.\n\n“Yes,” Nick said. “All this and I can cook, too. Get out of my way.”\n\nHe pushed Jamie aside, lightly enough because Jamie was so little that a rough push from Nick might have sent him through the window. Jamie still looked unsure, but he went over to the fridge and got some cheese in an obvious effort to look willing.\n\n“Can I ask you something?” he asked.\n\nNick looked up from chopping onions. “In the sense that I won’t stop you with actual violence,” he said in a guarded voice, “yes.”\n\n“What do magicians want?”\n\n“And why would you ask me that?” Nick said, and watched Jamie flinch at his tone. “I’m not a magician.”\n\nHe refused to think of Mum and how like her he was. He glared at Jamie and was amazed when Jamie did not look away.\n\n“I’m not!”\n\n“I–I didn’t think you were,” Jamie said, obviously lying. “I just meant — they kill all these people. Why do they do that? What could possibly be worth that?”\n\nIt was clear he thought that Nick had some kind of dark insight into a magician’s psyche. Nick wondered why he didn’t just go to Mum if he was so curious, but it wouldn’t do any real harm to answer him.\n\n“Power,” he said. “As I understand it, just using the power makes you want more. It’s a rush; it’s addictive, and it’s not just that. Once you have enough power, you can have anything you want. Some magicians are successful politicians. Some are actors. Some are completely normal people, people you see at the bank and the post office, who just happen to have the ability to change shape or control the weather. Some magicians are rich, some are famous, some are stupidly good-looking.”\n\nJamie gave Nick a rather complicated look.\n\nNick raised an eyebrow. “Some of us manage to be stupidly good-looking on our own.”\n\n“Er,” said Jamie, and cut himself on the cheese grater.\n\n“I have changed my mind,” Nick announced. “You can help cook by standing in a corner and not touching anything. Do it carefully.”\n\nHe said it without heat. The omelets were starting to resemble omelets, and he hoped the subject of magicians was closed. Most conversations he had with people from school went a lot worse than this.\n\nJamie was quiet, fidgeting with an oven glove on the countertop.\n\n“Don’t hurt yourself with that,” Nick advised.\n\nJamie grinned. “Okay.” He kept fidgeting while Nick went to the fridge for some peppers, and then asked suddenly, “So — where’s your dad?”\n\nNick slammed the fridge door. “He died.”\n\n“Oh.” Now Jamie had the look of a deer caught in the headlights, who for some reason was feeling really sad for the car. “Oh, I’m so sorry.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nBí mật detox gan và tế bào hóa ra lại cực kì đơn giản và tiện lợi\nTấp nập người mua chiếc đồng hồ bản sao Omega này khi nó giảm 90%\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

Why should you care?”\n\n“Um. Empathy?” Jamie suggested.\n\nNick stared at him silently. The silence stretched on, Nick watching Jamie become ever more uncomfortable, and then a moment before Jamie’s nerve broke Mae and Alan came into the kitchen and rescued him.\n\nAlan looked from Nick to Jamie’s alarmed face and seemed a little sad, just like he had when they were young and teachers had told him that Nick didn’t play well with others. Nick failed to see how it could keep coming as a surprise.\n\n“This is excellent,” said Mae, coming and sitting on the draining board. “Carry on. I have always dreamed of having handsome men lovingly prepare all my meals.”\n\n“Nick rescued the omelets,” Jamie confessed. “They were going wrong for me somehow.”\n\nMae laughed and tugged him toward her, putting her arms around him from behind and giving him a kiss on the side of his head. “Funny how they always do.”\n\nNeither of them was too bad. Mae was good at smoothing over awkward situations, good at dealing with people, and Nick appreciated that, but he didn’t need to find himself appreciating anything about her.\n\nNick made omelets and Jamie made jokes and Mae and Alan made conversation, but Alan was still marked. All Nick had learned was that Mae and Jamie’s parents would not be arriving to remove at least one problem from his life.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth day, Jamie tipped a switchblade out of his box of cornflakes.\n\n“I think these promotional campaigns have really got out of hand,” he said, freezing with his hand on the milk carton. “One shiny free knife with every packet of cereal bought is not a good message to send out to the kiddies.”\n\nHe picked up his bowl, tilting it and trying to drop the switchblade back into the box without actually touching it. Nick rolled his eyes, reached over, and took the knife, tucking it into the waistband of his jeans. He saw Jamie’s eyes wander to the flash of skin and didn’t make an issue out of it; a lot of people liked to look at Nick.\n\n“So — do you have a system?” Jamie asked.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Well, if knives go in the cornflakes, do guns go in the raisin bran? I just wanted to know if there’s some kind of system I should look out for.”\n\nEven though a system was actually not a bad idea, that kind of thing was a problem. The way Jamie kept making uneasy jokes about their life and Mae kept revealing a disturbing fascination with it made Nick feel as if he was a freak show suddenly on display for these people.\n\nMae walked in the door at that point. She pushed Jamie’s hair out of his eyes as she went by, then took a proper look at his pale face. She stooped and kissed his forehead before she went to get her muesli.\n\nThey were always doing weird stuff like that, as if they thought it was normal. It made Nick uncomfortable. He was just glad Alan hadn’t seen the latest bit of weirdness. Alan’s face went strange every time they did something like this, as if someone had hurt him.\n\nNick frowned at Mae as she tried to spoon up her muesli while bent over Alan’s copy of the Hexenhammer, an old German book about witches. Nick was used to having girls over now and then, but it was strange for him to have a girl constantly, comfortably around the house, sitting rumpled and sleep-flushed over a book, white curving flesh showing as her pajama top shifted with her movement.\n\nThat kind of thing was another problem.\n\nMae’s voice was accusing. “Are you looking down my top?”\n\n“Well,” Nick said, “it’s a new experience for me.”\n\n“Oh, really?”\n\n“Generally girls take their tops off so fast around me,” Nick explained. “It’s hard to get a good down-the-shirt view. Not that I really complain, under the circumstances. Very nice, by the way.”\n\nMae looked annoyed for a minute, and then a smile tugged at her mouth, drawing her away into amusement. “Well,” she said, shrugging. “I grew them myself.”\n\nNick liked the easy, casual way she flirted, comfortable with her body and confident about its appeal. He liked her smile.\n\nHe looked away from both of them, scowled, and ate his cereal. A few minutes later Alan came down with damp hair, smiling as if they were a group of friends who had chosen to be here together. He ruffled Jamie’s spiky blond locks before he sat beside Mae, and Nick narrowed his eyes.\n\nHe hoped that Jamie wasn’t getting any ideas about being a little brother to Alan.\n\nThey all started talking about their favorite music, Mae talking about rock music and Alan talking about classical, while Jamie put in a few words for country music.\n\nNick didn’t speak. His favorite music was the music of the Goblin Market, the drums that made the air thrum with danger and tried to pierce the silence of the demon world, and he didn’t need Dad’s voice in his head to remind him that wasn’t normal.\n\nAnother thing Nick couldn’t get used to was that Mae and Jamie knew about Mum. Nobody knew about Mum. Everyone at the Goblin Market, even Merris Cromwell, only knew about Dad. They knew that he had shown up at the Market wanting help for a wife bound with enchantments, and protection for his young family. Dad had taken Mum in when she came running out of the night chased by monsters, and then taken her as his own.\n\nIt was like one of the stories Alan used to read to Nick at bedtime, about the perfect knight shielding his lady. Only the lady was a murderer. She’d chosen Black Arthur, chosen to be a magician, and chosen to kill.\n\nNick thought Dad must have not known what she was until it was too late.\n\nNow two strangers knew that their mother had called the demons and made sacrifices for them. They sat at their dinner table and looked at Nick and saw his mother’s cold face. Mae had even started going upstairs to talk to Mum.\n\n“It’s very kind of you,” Alan said one night at dinner.\n\nMae shrugged. “I like doing it. Olivia tells a lot of wonderful stories. My mother’s never done anything worth talking about in her life.”\n\nShe’d taken to calling Mum Olivia, in the same casual way Alan did, as if they were all friends.\n\n“Your mother’s never fed people to demons?” Nick said. “Poor you.”\n\nMae’s eyes narrowed. “I just said Olivia was interesting. I didn’t say I thought what she did was right.”\n\nNick leaned across the table toward her. “Tell me,” he said, lowering his voice and watching the way his murmur sliced through her, small and sharp as a hook that a fish might swallow without thinking. “Do you find the demon’s mark on your brother interesting?”\n\n“No.”\n\nNick talked right over her. “Just think, if it wasn’t for the mark, you would never have heard Mum’s stories or danced at the Goblin Market. You were thrilled by all that, weren’t you? You think it’s all so exciting, so glamorous. Lucky for you Jamie got marked, isn’t it?” He lowered his voice even more to see her leaning toward him, caught, and then he twisted the hook into her flesh. He smiled at her slowly and whispered, “Bet you’re glad it happened.”\n\nMae’s face was crumpled and white as a tissue clenched in someone’s fingers.\n\n“How can you say something like that?” she said, her voice taut with outrage. “Your brother’s marked too. How does that make you feel?”\n\nShe glared at him, eyes accusing, and Nick saw that Alan and Jamie were looking at him too. He didn’t bother deciphering Jamie’s expression; he looked at his brother, and Alan looked back. He didn’t look angry like Mae. He looked patient, and a little pained; he looked as if he was waiting for Nick’s answer.\n\nThen they all looked away.\n\nAlan glanced from his own glass to Nick’s and then to the water jug. When Nick looked around the table, puzzled by Alan’s sudden preoccupation, he saw that everyone at the table was looking at their glasses.\n\nAll the glass on the table wore a shining spiderweb pattern. Fractures crossed and crisscrossed each other, cutting thin lines that caught the light. Nick’s and Alan’s eyes met over the rims of their suddenly beautiful glasses.\n\nThe glasses burst quietly, with no more noise than someone blowing on a dandelion clock. Then there was nothing but glittering shards and water pouring over the table.\n\nJamie’s plate broke in half.\n\nWhat was Mum playing at?\n\nNick got up and hit the table with his fist.\n\n“Nick, don’t,” Alan said. “You’ll hurt yourself.” He wrapped his hand around Nick’s fist and lifted it from the table.\n\nNick stared at him, for a paralyzing frustrated moment unable to understand what he was saying. It registered, and he looked at his hand in Alan’s, the skin unbroken. Alan’s warning had been in time.\n\n“Relax,” Alan said. “You asked Liannan. She said the Circle was coming, the whole Circle. You know how long it takes to move the summoning circles. They can’t possibly be here yet. It’s just Mum.”\n\nHe saw the change in Alan’s face, and wondered if his own face had betrayed him, shown some of the rage sweeping through him. Alan never liked seeing it, so Nick tried not to show it more often than he could help.\n\nThen he recognized the light in Alan’s eyes and realized he’d had an idea.\n\n“What?” he said, hope rising. “What is it?”\n\nAlan smiled at him. “Wait a bit. I need to go work something out.”\n\nHe left his dinner on the flooded table, and Nick heard his dragging footsteps going, as fast as he could, up the stairs and away from everyone to work out his new plan. Nick was in no humor to think about all Alan’s secrets.\n\n“I can clean up,” Jamie offered.\n\nNick let him, moodily forking up the rest of his dinner as Jamie cleaned.\n\nHe was not used to girls coming to his house so they could glare at him. Over broken glass and water, Mae was staring at him, her eyes gleaming and furious. Jamie was hastily moving anything that could have been used as a missile out of her reach.\n\nAfter another long moment of glaring, Mae got up. They heard her stamping her way up the stairs as if she wanted to grind every stair to powder under her heels.\n\nNick rolled his eyes. “How long’s that going to last for, then?”\n\n“Oh, don’t worry. Give her — ten years, and she’ll have forgotten all about it,” Jamie said, snagging Nick’s plate. “Or you could apologize.”\n\nNick scowled. “What?”\n\n“It’s a fairly simple concept,” said Jamie.\n\nMaybe it was for Jamie, who moved gently and apologetically through life, like a hunted animal trying not to stir the leaves as he passed. Nick wasn’t sorry, and he was ready to rip out the throat of anything hunting him. She’d invaded his house; she could apologize.\n\nOn the other hand, Nick couldn’t deal with any more hassle than he was dealing with right now. Maybe it would be simpler to go and smooth her down.\n\nHe left Jamie washing up and went upstairs to the room that Mae and Jamie shared, the room that used to be his, and found Mae on the bed that used to be his.\n\nShe was crying.\n\nNick was appalled.\n\n“I’ll get Alan,” he said, taking a smart step back.\n\nHe had the door almost shut when Mae said, “No, don’t!”\n\nWith great reluctance, he opened the door again. There she was, huddled on the bed with her arms around her knees, face red under her pink hair, rumpled and ridiculous-looking.\n\n“I’ll get Jamie,” he proposed, and what he really meant was, I’ll get out of here.\n\n“No,” Mae repeated. “Don’t.” She was starting to look angry again; all things considered, Nick found that soothing. She wiped at her face with the back of her hand and added, “I don’t want him to see me cry.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nViêm họng cấp/mãn tính,không biết cách này để chữa thì quá phí\nArgelomag\nNgười thợ 40 tuổi vui mừng vì thoát khỏi cánh cửa ung thư gan"

Nick imagined spending the next five minutes explaining to her that actually she could cry all the time if she liked, he just didn’t want to see it, and then shut his mouth.\n\n“What are you doing here, anyway?” Mae asked, her voice a little gruff with crying. She scrubbed at her wet cheeks with her sleeve and looked embarrassed.\n\nNick chose his words carefully. “Jamie said I should come and apologize.”\n\n“Oh,” Mae said. “Okay. Apology accepted, I guess. It’s not really you I’m mad at, anyway. I’m just — I’m scared, and that makes me angry, you know?”\n\n“Not really,” Nick answered, leaning against the door frame. “I don’t recall ever being scared.”\n\nMae looked taken aback.\n\n“Fear’s useless,” he tried to explain. “Either something bad happens or it doesn’t: If it doesn’t, you’ve wasted time being afraid, and if it does, you’ve wasted time that you could have spent sharpening your weapons.”\n\nMae stared at him for a while.\n\n“You’re lucky you’re cute,” she said eventually. “Because you’re kind of creepy.”\n\nNick grinned at her. “It’s a vibe that works for me.”\n\nIt was much more comfortable to flirt with her than see her cry. He risked a few steps into her room and she didn’t immediately burst into tears, so he looked around. Jamie made his bed, he noticed; Mae left her underwear on the floor.\n\n“Hey,” Mae said sharply, and he looked away from her underwear and raised an eyebrow.\n\n“I’ve never been scared,” he said, conceding her something. “But I’ve been angry, all right.”\n\n“Oh really,” Mae said. “You come off as so Zen.”\n\nNick grinned at her again, standing beside her bed. She smiled back and wiped a final fierce time at any tears still lingering on her cheeks.\n\nMae took a deep breath and seemed to be done with crying. “It’s just — he’s all I have. Even before they split up, Mum and Dad spent more time at the tennis club than with us. We used to play dolls together for hours when we were little.”\n\n“Oh,” Nick said. “Well, me and Alan did too. Obviously.”\n\n“Obviously,” Mae echoed, smiling.\n\n“If by dolls you meant knife practice.”\n\n“Maybe you can understand,” Mae allowed. “You do have a brother.”\n\nGuarded in case this was a womanly plot to make him talk about his feelings, Nick nevertheless let himself relax a bit more and said, “I do have a brother.”\n\n“He’s my little brother,” Mae continued. “I have to — I should be able to protect him, and I can’t. I didn’t. And I always did before. He’s my little brother,” she repeated insistently, speaking more to the universe than Nick, and then she took another deep breath. “I guess you can understand that. Alan must look after you.”\n\n“When I was small,” Nick conceded, and shrugged. “I don’t need much looking after these days.”\n\nHe almost smiled as he thought about being small, before Alan had been hurt, when he’d never imagined it was possible for Alan to be hurt. Alan had taught him to read and told him pointless bedtime stories and insisted on holding his hand when they crossed the street.\n\nIt was different now. They looked out for each other. They were a team. Or that was how it had been; Nick didn’t see how keeping secrets was looking out for him.\n\n“What’s wrong?” Mae inquired.\n\nHe looked down at her and saw her frowning. He reached out, wrapped a strand of that silly pink hair around his wrist, and smiled at her slowly, drawing a smile from her in return.\n\n“What could be wrong?” he asked.\n\nHe knew where this was going, and from the calm look in her eyes she did too. It was solid ground in the midst of his home being invaded, Alan lying, girls crying, and boys talking to him about empathy. It was good to be sure of something again.\n\n“So,” Mae said, uncurling from the tight ball of misery she’d been in and stretching a little. “You don’t get scared.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Ever get lonely?” She smiled as she spoke, her dimple showing as she brought out the line.\n\nHe stooped toward the dimple, and then remembered Alan.\n\nHe let go of her hair, and it fell from around his wrist. “No,” he said, his voice cold. “I have my brother.”\n\nMae looked puzzled, as if she was trying to work out what had inspired this change of behavior rather than getting ready to weep again. Nick was a little relieved, but mostly he just wanted out. He didn’t want to see girls cry, and he didn’t want anything that Alan might want for himself.\n\n“Wait,” Mae said as he headed for the door. He glanced back at her. “Thanks for coming up,” she said. “I thought — Alan said you might want help with your homework.”\n\nShe looked at him questioningly, and he was glad she wasn’t making a scene. He supposed he should have predicted this. It would take more than demon hunting to make Alan stop nagging him to do his homework.\n\nHe shrugged and said, “Sure.”\n\nA few minutes later he found himself in the sitting room and on the floor, hunching over the small table like a grouchy vulture. The teachers had assigned him an essay on a stupid book about some idiot girl whose problems were too small to really count and whose life had happened too long ago to matter. Alan usually helped him with this kind of thing; the fact that Alan was somewhere upstairs, doing God knew what, made Nick feel even more annoyed by the book girl.\n\nNick was already wrestling with the girl’s love life when Mae joined him. She came over to the table, sat crosslegged, and took the book in her hands.\n\n“What are you having trouble with?”\n\nThe answer was everything, but Nick decided to be more specific. “The stupid girl goes back to the man who lied to her. She’ll never be able to trust him. What am I supposed to write about that?”\n\nMae leaned back thoughtfully, arching her spine a little. “Maybe she doesn’t want to completely trust him. Maybe she’s looking for an element of danger.”\n\n“Maybe she’s stupid,” Nick said. “Still doesn’t give me much to write about.”\n\n“You might find things slightly clearer if I read out some important bits,” Mae suggested, and did so. Her voice was calm and sweet.\n\nShe obviously had very specific ideas about which were the important bits. She’d worked out, after three days, that Nick didn’t like to read. She might run away to raves all the time, but she was smart, in the same way Alan was smart.\n\nWhen the low light fell on her ridiculous hair that way, it looked a pale rose color. She lifted her gaze from the book to meet his, and shadows quivered in her dark eyes.\n\n“Right,” Nick said. “Thanks.”\n\nMae smiled slowly. “You’re welcome.”\n\nNick had never really wanted to get to know a girl, but here she was, in his house. He felt as if he was being forced into it.\n\nMae walked toward the door and as he watched her go, she turned her head to look at him. The light went out, and the curve of her neck and fall of her hair were suddenly swallowed up in darkness.\n\nHer voice was even. “I suppose this isn’t a power failure.”\n\nNick did not bother to answer her. They both knew what it was.\n\nNick had excellent night vision and acclimated himself quickly to the darkness. He palmed a knife from the sheath strapped around his arm and walked with a soft tread toward Mae. He could see her shape clearly, but he knew that to her there was nothing but black night and then the sudden touch of his hand on her waist. He held on to her with one hand and his knife with the other.\n\nShe stayed still. She had not even flinched when he grabbed her. Nick did like her courage.\n\n“Don’t move,” he said. “If I see something move, I will stab it.”\n\nHer voice was a whisper. He did not even see the movement of her lips in the shadows. “I understand.”\n\nThey waited a while, standing close, the curve of her hip pressed against his thigh, until it became clear that there was nothing stirring in that still night. Light brimmed for a moment, a faint flicker caught between shadows and brightness, and then flooded the room. Now that she was safe and could see, Mae moved. She put her hand on his arm, her fingertips five warm points against his skin, and he remembered her trembling lips close to his on the night of the Goblin Market.\n\n“I have to make sure Alan is okay,” said Nick.\n\n“I’ll check on Jamie,” Mae responded.\n\nNick sheathed his knife instead of watching her go. It would be better if she and her brother both left, as soon as possible.\n\nThe sudden descent of darkness had only moved Alan to light a candle so he could see the map of England he had stretched out on their floor.\n\n“If demons had attacked under cover of darkness, were you planning to roll that up and hit them with it?” Nick inquired.\n\n“No,” said Alan, and waved his gun to prove it. Then he used the gun to trace a line along the map from Exeter to London. “Tell me what you see.”\n\n“I think it’s called a map.”\n\nAlan gave him an expressive look over the top of his glasses. “The Obsidian Circle’s coming for us,” he said patiently. “Liannan said they’d take nine days. It doesn’t take nine days to get from Exeter to London, even with the summoning circle. They’ll want to make a stop, find a good place to set up their circle so they can arrive in London with a full complement of demons. They’ll want to be at maximum strength. They’ll be calling up every demon they have.”\n\nNick was glad that Alan wasn’t keeping the plan a secret. He felt he could wait to see why his brother clearly considered this good news.\n\nAlan’s eyes were gleaming with triumph. “So where, between Exeter and London, would you stop to do a spot of demon calling?”\n\nHis gun traced the path between Exeter and London again, lingering for a moment to give Nick a clue. Nick whistled between his teeth.\n\n“Of course,” he said. “Stonehenge.”\n\nAlan called Mae and Jamie up to hear their plan, and once Alan had recovered somewhat from Mae sitting on his bed, he was able to explain it.\n\n“Magicians have the same traditions as the Goblin Market people. They’ll choose a place with a lot of human history attached to it to call their demons, and there’s a six-thousand-year-old tomb on the way.” Alan shrugged. “They’ll come looking for us here. We can surprise them there.”\n\n“We catch them off guard,” Nick said. “We catch two of them and bring them back here. Then we kill them and use their lifeblood to take off the marks. You guys can go home, and we can go into hiding.”\n\nHe thought the plan sounded good, and Jamie seemed to agree with him. Mae and Alan looked faintly wistful.\n\n“You’ll have to teach me Aramaic by e-mail,” Mae said, and Alan looked embarrassingly pleased.\n\nThey launched into an enthusiastic little dialogue about dead languages which Nick, as someone who had failed French, did not pay much attention to. He just noted that this time Alan had picked someone with whom he had a lot in common. That might help him. He was glad, he told himself. It would help them both. Alan could use a girlfriend to distract him from that girl Marie in the picture. Nick wouldn’t even think about touching Mae if she was his brother’s girlfriend.\n\nMae shifted on the bed, and a book fell out from under Alan’s pillow. Alan moved so fast that he caught it before it hit the floor and shoved it out of sight.\n\nNick saw Alan’s wary glance toward him. He was still trying to keep the picture a secret, then.\n\n“We’ll go tomorrow,” Alan said. “I’ll write you a note about going to the dentist, Nick, but you can still make your morning classes. You’re not skipping two full days this week.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nViêm họng cấp/mãn tính,không biết cách này để chữa thì quá phí\nArgelomag\nNgười thợ 40 tuổi vui mừng vì thoát khỏi cánh cửa ung thư gan"

Chỉ cần thoa mỗi tối\n\nNormally he would have rolled his eyes and made some comment about Alan being a mother hen, but Nick was still frowning at the pillow. It didn’t take Alan long to turn back to Mae and begin talking about Latin.\n\nLater Alan brought up the subject of Mae again. Nick was trying to get to sleep when Alan came in after his shower with his glasses fogged up and his hair dripping onto the shoulders of his I’M A LIBRARIAN, NOT A FIGHTER T-shirt. He tried to towel his hair dry and talk about his feelings at the same time.\n\n“I know that she’d eaten the fever fruit and everything, the night of the Goblin Market,” he said. “But she did pick me. I mean, that might mean something.”\n\nNick stared at the ceiling and said, “I guess so.”\n\n“It wouldn’t be right to ask her while she’s living with us and relying on us to help her brother,” Alan went on, worried about all the usual little details only he would have worried about. “Afterward, though, I thought I might ask her if I could give her a call. Sometime. What do you think?”\n\n“I don’t know why you always do this,” Nick said. “What’s the point? You want to get married and have babies and have to run with them all over the country, like Dad had to run with us?”\n\nIt sounded more savage than he’d meant it to. When he levered himself up on one elbow and threw his brother a baleful glare, Alan looked a little pale.\n\n“That’s not what I meant,” he said. “I don’t — it’ll be years before I start thinking about getting married and things.”\n\n“But you do want to,” said Nick. “Someday. That’s what you’re saying. Why?”\n\nHis brother flinched. “You really don’t understand why someone would want a family?”\n\n“I have no idea!”\n\nAlan clenched his fists around the damp material of his towel, looking like he wanted to throw it in Nick’s face. He went dark red and snapped, “I want somebody to love me.”\n\n“Oh my God,” Nick exclaimed, turning violently away.\n\nWhen he turned around again, which was not for some time, he saw Alan reaching under his pillow to touch that stupid book as if for reassurance. All of Alan’s pictures stared at Nick from the bedside table: Mum and Dad on their wedding day, looking as young as Alan was now, Nick a scowling child in the uniform of a long-forgotten school. When Nick closed his eyes, he saw the hidden picture as if it was lined up alongside the others.\n\n“Alan,” he said quietly.\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Do you get scared?”\n\nAlan laughed, a small fraught laugh like something tearing, and said, “I’m scared all the time.”\n\nThe answer was so unexpected that Nick opened his eyes. He’d never thought of Alan as being scared. Alan always had a plan, always stayed calm and knew what to do. He looked at Alan, and his brother’s face looked just as it always did, calm in the low light, but his face lied just as well as the rest of him.\n\nLater that night Nick woke to the sound of Alan talking to demons in his sleep, words Nick couldn’t make out broken up with cries. He rolled out of bed as fast as if it was an attack and shook Alan roughly awake. Alan stirred, opened his eyes, and then recoiled violently from Nick, his back hitting the wall.\n\n“Hey,” Nick said. “Hey, it’s me.”\n\nAlan was breathing hard, fresh lines of pain around his mouth and sweat shining on his face. In the moonlight the sweat had a silver sheen; beneath it Alan looked gray. He looked like he’d been fighting, and of course he had. The demons were trying to put the third mark on him. He could only hold them off for so long.\n\nEventually Alan smiled a bad copy of the smile he used to reassure children, all strained around the edges.\n\n“Right,” he said. “Okay, I’m all right now. I’d like to sleep.”\n\nBut when Nick climbed back into bed and lay silent for a while, listening in case Alan had any more dreams, Alan did not sleep. There was a click, and a circle of yellow light pooled against the wall across from Nick’s bed. When he glanced over he saw Alan’s thin back, saw the silhouette of his hands. The shadows of Alan’s fingers were like long black ribbons in the yellow light, and he knew what his brother was staring at. As if he couldn’t get back to sleep without looking at her.\n\nThe next morning when Alan got up to make breakfast, Nick stole the photograph.\n\n8\n\nThe Capture\n\nTHAT DAY AT BREAK TIME, NICK DID NOT GO AND HANG around with his new crowd. He went out into what passed for school grounds in London and, standing behind a sad-looking hedge that had been coaxed into half life by the coming of May, he made a call. It was to the local paper in Durham, and he asked them to put in a certain advertisement.\n\n“I’ll scan the picture and e-mail it to you,” Nick said. “Underneath put ‘If you have any information about Marie, please call.’”\n\nHe gave them his number and the details of the emergency credit card Alan had insisted he should have. He went into the computer room, scanned the photograph, and sent it off, using an e-mail address he’d just made for the purpose. Nick had never wanted to e-mail anybody before.\n\nHe did not give the blond girl’s smiling face more than a cursory glance this time around. He’d decided he didn’t like her. He would find out what she’d meant to Alan, make sure it was over, and then never have to think about her again.\n\nThat done, Nick skipped his last class and went outside to wait for the car. It pulled up, and Nick was enormously unsurprised to see Mae in the passenger seat. He climbed into the back alongside Jamie without comment, and they were off. The journey lasted a little over two hours, though Alan insisted they stop at some place called Andover for sandwiches, in case they missed dinner while they were hunting magicians.\n\nThey chose the car park beside the railway station in Salisbury as an unobtrusive place to stop.\n\n“I still don’t see why we’re going to the city,” Jamie said. “If the magicians want to call up demons near Stonehenge, shouldn’t we go there?”\n\n“I’ll drive up to Stonehenge and take a look around,” Alan told him, “but it’s most likely the Circle is staying in Salisbury. It’s the middle of the day. They’re not going to want the tourists to see them conjuring up demons.” He hesitated. Silence fell and lingered, seeming embarrassed to be there. “Er, Nick can see illusions, so he’ll be going into Salisbury. Who—?”\n\nNow there was a question hanging in the car like very awkward air freshener. Nick saw Mae’s hand reaching for the handle of her door.\n\n“I’ll take Jamie,” Nick said, grabbing him by the collar of his shirt and hauling him out of the car. He kept talking over Jamie’s startled squawk. “You have Mae.”\n\nAlan looked absurdly delighted, but he kept himself together enough to say, “Let’s meet at Salisbury Cathedral in an hour.”\n\n“Right,” Nick answered. “Where’s Salisbury Cathedral?”\n\n“Um,” Jamie said, “I think that’s it over there.”\n\nNick looked over his shoulder and saw the cathedral, looming against the sky and brandishing its turrets in all directions. The gray, spiky thing reminded Nick of the cathedral at Exeter. There were supposed to be scattered bones under every inch of ground in Exeter Cathedral close. He wondered how many bones were buried around this one.\n\nHe nodded at Alan, and the car peeled away just when Jamie had nerved himself to say, “I’d really rather go with—”\n\nJamie looked somewhat forlornly after the disappearing car. Then his eyes slid uncertainly over to Nick.\n\nJamie had seen Nick at school, at home, and at the Goblin Market, which meant that Jamie knew him better than anyone but Alan.\n\nIt only now occurred to Nick that he was fairly sure Jamie was scared of him, and here they were stranded together in Salisbury.\n\nWell, he was helping to save Jamie’s life. Jamie could learn to cope.\n\n“Come on,” he said. “Let’s go check out the pubs.”\n\nJamie blinked. “Sorry?”\n\n“Magicians like pubs,” Nick answered. “Same reason they like cities. Gives them an opportunity to mingle with people and choose a victim. If someone’s drunk enough, they can get marked in the bar and never know what hit them.”\n\n“I’m on the wagon,” Jamie said. “Starting now.”\n\nNick made a noncommittal noise and started off down the road. He glanced over his shoulder to make sure that Jamie was behind him. Jamie was, trailing unhappily in his wake, and something else occurred to Nick. The boy had been thin to start with, and now his face was pinched and too pale. There were deep lines on either side of his mouth. The world had taught Nick a lot of things, and one of them was too-certain knowledge of what someone in pain looked like.\n\n“The dreams the demons send you,” he said. “They’re bad?”\n\nJamie looked startled. “They’re not good. It’s cold, cold enough to really hurt, and there are voices whispering all the time. In the dream I can never see anything, but every time it’s colder, and every time the voices get closer.” He stopped and looked at Nick in that ridiculous, wide-eyed way, and Nick remembered him babbling about empathy. “Alan’s tougher than I am,” Jamie added softly. “I don’t think he lets the dreams bother him much.”\n\nIt was true that Nick would have noticed Alan getting thinner. Most k tho;\n\n“Alan is tough,” Nick conceded, and eased his pace so Jamie might have some hope of keeping up. “Don’t look so worried,” he added. “I won’t let anything happen to you.”\n\nJamie seemed more surprised than reassured. “You won’t?”\n\n“No, I won’t. Alan would kill me.”\n\nJamie blinked. “I’m very touched.”\n\nThey started at the unimaginatively titled Railway Tavern, proceeding on to places called the Bird in Hand and the Old Ale House. The pubs had all the usual fittings: a bar, a bartender, and customers. The Bird in Hand even had a sign that showed a young woman lounging on a gigantic hand, but no magicians.\n\nNick had never been to Salisbury before. The city seemed mainly residential and comfortable with that. He and Jamie walked down several streets, lined with aged rectangular houses that gave the impression of standing about in cozy groups, to get from one pub to the next. The buildings got older and Nick got more annoyed as they crossed a bridge and found little churches and shops rubbing shoulders, and still no sign of magicians.\n\nThey even stopped by some hotels on their quest from pub to pub. Jamie peered too closely at people’s faces in the street, searching for any resemblance to the magicians’ pictures Alan had drawn from the descriptions of Market folk, and Nick was on constant alert for the sight of something too perfect, too real, which would signal an illusion being used.\n\nThey were in a pub called the Chough when Nick returned from his investigation of every corner of the place to find Jamie sitting at the bar exactly where he had left him.\n\nHe had not left him penned in by two men, however. Nick’s first thought was of magicians, and he reached for his nearest knife before it occurred to him that Jamie’s earring probably had more to do with this situation than his demon’s mark.\n\nIt had been a long and frustrating search already. Nick was itching for a fight.\n\n“These guys bothering you?” he asked Jamie softly, and gave the two men his coldest look. One of them stepped back.\n\n“No, no, no,” Jamie said at once, looking wildly around at empty air, as if Nick had started to throw knives.\n\nNick could throw knives quite well, but that was beside the point.\n\n“If you say so.”\n\n“I do,” Jamie said. “That is, in fact, what I say. So — I hear there’s an antiques fair in town. We should check it out!”\n\nJamie, who rarely touched Nick, was so overwhelmed by concern for the people who’d been harassing him that he grabbed Nick by the elbow. Nick refused to move for a moment, staying immobile with no particular effort, and watched the men. Time stretched, weighed down with the growing fear and hesitation of the two strangers.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nKì lạ với bí quyết giúp tránh xa đột quỵ ở tỉnh Nghệ An\nCardiohelptips\nĐừng bỏ qua đồng hồ bản sao Omega này khi nó giảm 90% chỉ 1 ngày\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

Chỉ cần thoa mỗi tối\n\nIt relaxed Nick. He smiled at them, and the other man stepped back as well. Then Nick let Jamie pull him out of the bar.\n\nHe shook off Jamie’s restraining grasp and stepped away from him as soon as they were outside.\n\n“An antiques fair,” he repeated, almost amused.\n\n“Sometimes I panic,” Jamie told him.\n\n“I’ve noticed that.”\n\nThey kept walking, and Nick felt his brief moment of cheer fading with every step. They had completed a circuit around Salisbury and ended up where they had begun. There had been no sign of magic from one end of the city to the other.\n\nNick’s gloomy thoughts were interrupted by Jamie, sounding hesitant. “That was — a little scary.”\n\n“Was it?” Nick asked.\n\n“Oh, right,” said Jamie. “Mae told me. Apparently you don’t get scared.”\n\n“No,” Nick said. “I don’t. I don’t waste my time with useless fussing around, feeling scared or anxious or what the hell it is you people do. You two may be so complicated you’re falling over the knots you’ve made of yourselves, but I’m very simple.”\n\nJamie slanted a shy glance over at him. “No, you’re not.”\n\n“Fine,” said Nick. “I’m an international man of mystery. Don’t fall for me. I’ll only break your heart.”\n\n“Don’t worry,” Jamie murmured.\n\nNick almost liked him for that, even if he and his sister had apparently declared every day Make Nick Talk About His Feelings Day.\n\n“I’m — I don’t mean to pester you,” Jamie offered after a moment. “I know you’re doing a lot for us—”\n\nNick felt obliged to correct him. “I’m not doing anything for you,” he said. “Alan’s the one who wants to help people. You’re putting my brother in danger, so I don’t like either of you much, but it’s nothing personal.”\n\n“We hadn’t endangered Alan when we were at school together,” Jamie said. “You avoided us then, too.”\n\n“Well,” said Nick, “that’s because you were weird.”\n\nThey were just off the high street and getting closer every step to the railway station when Nick saw another pub and headed wearily for it.\n\n“Sorry, I’m taking a moment to process,” Jamie said behind him. “I’ve never been called weird by someone who summons demons before.”\n\n“That’s something I do,” Nick stated absently. “That’s not what I am. I have to do all this, but one day Alan and I won’t have to anymore.”\n\nThey went into the pub, which was called the New Inn. Nick presumed the wood and stone fittings, not to mention the black-fringed lanterns, were ironic. He prowled across the floor, scanning dim corners, with Jamie still at his heels.\n\nJamie was also still talking. “See, that’s not entirely true. I mean, I don’t want to offend you, but it’s not just that you summon demons. It’s not even about the fact that you’ve got more knives on you right now than a fancy restaurant has in its silverware drawer. You, um, you don’t smile, and you look through people, and you’re—”\n\n“Quiet,” Nick said.\n\n“Yes, you’re very quiet,” Jamie agreed, “and I have to say, I find it a little disturbing.”\n\n“I mean,” Nick said, “shut up. I think I see something.”\n\nAt the left corner of the bar was a magician. He was buying a bag of crisps.\n\nIf he had not attempted to disguise himself, Nick would have passed him by. This man had cast a few simple illusions on himself, to make himself look older and, if Nick was any judge, darker than he was, and the too artistic lines of the wrinkles and too dense blackness of the hair leaped out at Nick. The magician was like a man painted in oils, superimposed on a world drawn in crayon.\n\nNick’s muscles all surged forward at once before he’d even had time to think about it. The hunt was on.\n\n“Get down,” he whispered.\n\n“I’m way ahead of you,” Jamie said from the floor.\n\nA few people glanced at the suddenly prone boy, Nick noticed in his peripheral vision. Fewer still, with good instincts for where the real danger was coming from, looked at him. He didn’t care about them. It did not matter who saw him draw the knife, so long as the magician went down.\n\nOnly he had to bring the magician to Alan alive. The thought pulled him up short and he faltered, his easy movements toward the kill lost.\n\nIf he had been coming to kill the magician, the man would never have seen him. He’d done it before. He could move smoothly enough, surely enough, to be invisible for as long as he needed to be. When he faltered, the magician’s head snapped around.\n\nHe dropped his crisps onto the counter and threw up a hand. All Nick saw was a glitter in the air, and then wind hurled sand into his eyes. Nick blinked and the magician bolted, the door of the inn slamming behind him.\n\nThe guy couldn’t be very powerful if the first weapon in his arsenal was sand.\n\n“Jamie!” Nick snapped. “Can you see?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nThat was lucky. At this range, Nick would’ve expected the magician’s sand to have blinded them both.\n\n“Then follow him!”\n\n“Um,” said Jamie, and as Nick tried to see through his smarting eyes, he felt Jamie seize his wrist and pull him outside. “Um,” Jamie repeated, sounding even more lost than before. “I can’t follow him anymore.”\n\n“Why not?” Nick demanded, just as he became able to focus and saw the magician lifted by a demon’s wind onto the slanted rooftops.\n\n“Because I can’t fly,” Jamie answered weakly.\n\nNick narrowed his eyes. The magician did not look as if the wind would be carrying him any farther away. He was running, stumbling on the roof tiles, as if he had only his legs and no more magic to rely on for escape.\n\nHe spoke through his teeth. “Nor can he.”\n\nThere was a shiny black painted pipe on either side of the inn. Nick grabbed the nearest and swung himself up, shoes sliding on the slick paint as he pulled himself up by main force. He grasped for a scrabbling instant at the gutter, and then put all his weight on his arms and hauled himself onto the roof.\n\nThe magician was getting farther away. Nick started to run. There was no hesitation now, no thought about what he should do when he caught up with the man, just the clean absence of thought and the ferocious simplicity of the chase. Nick was going to bring him down. What happened next did not matter.\n\nThe magician was fast, but not fast enough. Nick would have caught him in a minute if it hadn’t been for the terrain he was chasing him over. For the first time he knew why roofs were described as shingled. The jagged red tiles on these roofs were like the jagged sliding stones on a beach that was all shingle. Every tile slipped treacherously underfoot. Every time Nick had to turn during his chase, there was a tinkle of falling tiles.\n\nTurning a corner, he fell hard on his hands and knees. The sky tilted sharply in his vision, but he clung to the roof, jamming his leg against the row of little white spikes at the edge. The tiles left deep impressions in his palms, but after a moment he was able to leap up and run again.\n\nNick was drawing closer, bearing down on the man. The magician looked over his shoulder for an instant and Nick saw fear in his eyes, saw he knew what was coming. It made Nick want to laugh, but he only ran, so fast that he almost threw himself out into space when the roofs ended.\n\nHe looked around to see if the magician’s demon had managed to blow him across the street and saw the man veering for an old bridge that spanned over the street to join up with the next set of rooftops. Nick grinned, feeling his lips skin back from his teeth, and hurtled over the curved bridge in pursuit. A gold coat of arms flashed by as he ran, a bright lion below making a face at him. He was several strides past the bridge, onto the next roof and close enough to hear the magician’s ragged, desperate breaths. Nick felt the solid weight of his knife handle against his palm, with no memory of reaching for it. He narrowed his eyes, judging the distance, measuring how hard he’d have to throw the knife, and remembered again that he could not kill this magician.\n\nNick tossed up his knife as he ran and caught it by the blade. Cold steel cut across his palm and he ignored it, aimed, and threw.\n\nThe hilt of the knife caught the magician hard on the back of his head, and he went down like a thrown stone, tumbling head over heels. Nick had to throw himself down and seize the man around the middle to stop him falling off the roof.\n\nThey were almost at the end of the rooftops. There was nothing ahead but a street and a bridge, this one actually over water. Down below Jamie was running. Nick could hear his voice assuring passersby that this was a daring rooftop chase scene they were rehearsing for a movie.\n\nNick sat on the rooftop, cold, breathing harshly, and with his heart hammering a loud, triumphant rhythm in his chest. He’d done it. He’d caught a live magician, and now Alan would be safe.\n\n9\n\nChains\n\n“ALAN,” NICK SAID. “DON’T BE A FOOL.”\n\nHe did not think he had ever been so angry in his life. He’d been the one to catch the magician. He’d carried him over his shoulder through the streets of Salisbury with Jamie on his heels, explaining to anyone who questioned them that the unconscious man was Jamie’s cousin, and he had fits. Nick had trussed the magician up in iron, mostly bike chains he’d stolen, and thrown him in the boot of the car.\n\nNick had caught the magician. He should get to decide what to do with him.\n\nAlan ran a hand through his hair as he always did when he was worried, leaving a fuzz of curls in the wake of his fingers as if he felt the outside of his head had to express the turmoil inside. “I’m trying to think of what’s best for everyone.”\n\n“I don’t care what’s best for everyone!” Nick snarled. “I only care about what’s best for you.”\n\nJamie flattened himself against the wall, and even Mae jumped. Only Alan continued to look tired and unaffected, and Nick was frustrated enough to wish for a moment that his brother would just this once be like everyone else so Nick could scare him enough to do what he wanted him to do.\n\n“The Circle may know by now that we have him,” Alan said slowly. “They’ll be on the alert.”\n\n“There were no other magicians around to see us take him. Don’t you think I looked? Let’s kill him now and get the mark off you,” Nick argued. “Before they notice he’s gone and send something after him.”\n\n“We can’t kill him yet. We need two magicians, and we won’t be able to surprise the Circle again. We need to get information from this one before we kill him.”\n\nNick did not know what to do. Alan insisted on acting as if Jamie’s life was worth as much as Alan’s, and no matter how much Nick disagreed, he knew with a wrench of furious despair that he was powerless to change Alan’s mind.\n\n“Alan,” he said at last. “I swear I’ll catch another magician. I’ll do whatever you want. Only let me kill this one now and get the mark off. Alan. Please.”\n\nWhen Alan looked at him steadily, Nick had to look away. Alan knew Nick, and knew what Nick was thinking: that he would try to catch another magician, but he might fail, and what did broken promises matter if Alan was safe?\n\n“I don’t think we should take my mark off now,” Alan said at last. “I think we should take off Jamie’s.”\n\n“Oh no,” Nick breathed. “No.”\n\nIf Alan thought for a moment that Nick would let Jamie be saved while Alan was still in danger, he was dreaming. Nick opened his mouth to say so.\n\nUnexpectedly, Jamie spoke. He said, “No.” Everyone looked at him and his mouth quivered, but he pressed his lips together for a moment and went on. “You wouldn’t have a second-tier mark if it weren’t for me. We wouldn’t have this magician if it weren’t for you and Nick. It wouldn’t be fair to — I want you to go first.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nKì lạ với bí quyết giúp tránh xa đột quỵ ở tỉnh Nghệ An\nCardiohelptips\nĐừng bỏ qua đồng hồ bản sao Omega này khi nó giảm 90% chỉ 1 ngày\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

Chỉ cần thoa mỗi tối\n\n“Thank you, Jamie,” Nick said savagely. “At least somebody is showing some sense—”\n\n“Shh,” Mae ordered, speaking for the first time. She was leaning against the wall, studying their prisoner, and now her eyes narrowed. “I think he’s waking up.”\n\nEveryone fell silent and stared at the magician, who was chained to a chair in the middle of their sitting room and was now stirring.\n\nHe was very young, as magicians went. Nick usually only saw magicians in their true forms after he or Alan had managed to kill one, but he did not think any of the corpses had been as young as this. He looked about twenty, but Mum could not have been much older when she joined the Obsidian Circle. Youth did not make him any less dangerous.\n\nIt did make him look less dangerous, and he was not a very threatening specimen in any case. The magician had a shock of sandy hair, standing up on his head and then falling into his eyes like the petals on a rather floppy daffodil, and beneath the sandy mop he had a narrow, inquisitive face. There was something about his features, perhaps his long, pointed chin, that vaguely recalled a fox. Apart from that he had a friendly, freckled face, the face of a young man whom old ladies would instantly trust.\n\nHe opened wide gray eyes, blinked, and looked dismayed.\n\n“Oh Lord,” said the magician. “Now I am in the soup.”\n\nNick was not in the least worried about himself or Alan. They knew what magicians were. He was worried about Mae and Jamie, and what their reaction was going to be once they got over the revelation that magicians looked and acted entirely harmless, entirely human. Until they didn’t.\n\n“We’re going to kill you,” he said deliberately. “There will be no negotiation. I want to kill you now, but others of the group think you might have information we need. So we’re going to have to torture you first.”\n\nHe added the last sentence so Mae and Jamie could know the worst at once and deal with it however they had to. He didn’t want to have to cope with hysterics later.\n\n“I think I could be persuaded to offer you some information without being tortured, if it’s all the same to you,” the magician said. He had a rueful way of talking, as if inviting sympathy, and a soft Irish accent.\n\nNick did not often have much use for his switchblade, since the moment it took to flick the weapon open could be a moment that made the difference between life or death. Now he felt he could take his time, and he appreciated the cold, quiet snick the knife made opening, and the way the magician’s face paled as he heard it.\n\n“Talk.”\n\n“My name’s Gerald,” the magician said promptly. Again his rueful voice asked them all to laugh a little at the name and see him as a little more human.\n\nHis shrewd, friendly eyes traveled over them all, making eye contact and assessing weaknesses. He didn’t even look at Nick, which confirmed Nick’s opinion of him as intelligent. He looked at Alan for a long moment and did nothing, looked at Mae and smiled bravely, and then let his eyes settle on Jamie.\n\n“We don’t care about your name, magician,” said Alan. “Any more than you cared about the names of the people you’ve killed.”\n\nGerald looked genuinely indignant. “Killers? Is that all you think magicians are?”\n\n“Not really,” Nick said, playing with his switchblade. “If I did, I’d think I was a magician.”\n\nHe knew he should shut up. Mae and Jamie were looking from Nick with his knife to Gerald chained in his chair. He knew they were making comparisons.\n\n“I was born a magician,” Gerald said. “It isn’t about anything you do. It’s in the blood. You’re born with the call toward magic, toward power, and one day, no matter what you do, the magic will find you.”\n\nHe looked from Jamie to Mae as he spoke, Mae who loved knowledge as much as Alan did, and obviously he found enough encouragement in her face to go on.\n\n“People think we can’t do much magic without demons, but that’s not true. The power that makes calling them easier shows itself in other ways. When I was a child, strange things happened around me all the time. The Obsidian Circle came to recruit me. Nobody had ever understood me before, but I’d always been a magician. One of my ancestors ruled half his country with his power. Magicians see the world differently. Everything is gray and flat and cold, nothing means anything, until you have the demon in your summoning circle and you have some control of the world at last.”\n\n“It’s nice that you feel fulfilled by feeding people to demons,” Alan said mildly. He took a knife from his boot and turned it over in his hand, watching his blade catch the light. “Have you got anything useful to say, or do you need encouragement?”\n\nNick saw Jamie glance, startled, at Alan’s hard eyes. Soft-spoken Gerald must have been looking better by the minute. If they silenced Gerald now, though, they would look even more brutal.\n\n“It’s not like your Market is as pure as the wings of a dove,” Gerald said sharply. “Do your friends know what it takes to prop up the Market? You’re funded by blood money!”\n\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Nick said, bored. “But I know it’s not useful.”\n\n“It’s not always a question of feeding people to the demons, either,” Gerald said, still looking at Mae. “Some people want it. Some people ask for it.”\n\nJamie’s voice was small but fierce, and it made Mae’s intent concentration on the magician waver for the first time. “I didn’t.”\n\n“Then I’m sorry,” Gerald said, and he sounded sorry. “I didn’t send a demon after you. I wouldn’t do something like that. Surely you know that there are people in this world who hate their lives, who don’t seem able to live them, who seem able to do nothing but drag themselves through a succession of endless unpleasant tasks until they die? You’ve seen people like that. You know them. Don’t tell me that you don’t.”\n\nMae hesitated, and with hesitation was lost. “I do, but—”\n\n“Don’t you think people like that might trade the lives they don’t know how to use for what they want? Demons don’t come as invaders. They offer people something they want, whether it is money or oblivion or a night that makes these people feel alive as nothing else ever has. And when those people choose to give in, the world gets something in exchange. Demons have lived for centuries; they are wise and powerful, they can give so much back to the world—”\n\n“They can give you such power,” Alan said. “Your Circle marked Jamie and me. Neither of us were willing. I don’t think any of your victims would be willing if they understood what they were agreeing to.”\n\nMae cleared her throat. “So sometimes they do agree?”\n\n“Sometimes they do,” Alan had to confess.\n\n“I don’t unleash demons on unwilling victims,” Gerald went on, clearly trying to throw enough conviction into his voice to carry both Mae and Jamie with him. “I’m sorry you were marked.” His voice trembled. “Are you really going to torture me?”\n\nHe looked directly at Jamie, who looked as panicked as if someone had handed him a thumbscrew and was waiting with an expectant air. “No,” he said, almost wildly. “No, I can’t. I couldn’t possibly.”\n\nHe turned his face away from Gerald and fixed Alan with a look of appeal. Alan stood, limped over to him, and placed a hand on Jamie’s thin shoulder. The gesture might have been more reassuring if Alan hadn’t had a knife in his other hand.\n\n“Don’t worry,” Alan said. “You don’t have to. I can do it.”\n\nHe looked strained as he said it, but he did not hesitate. Nick was sure Alan didn’t like it, as sure as he was that Alan would do it if he had to.\n\nWhen Mae spoke, it caught everyone off guard. “If it will help my brother. If it’s for Jamie and — and you,” she said, and faltered for a moment on seeing Alan’s look of startled happiness. “Then I can help. I can do it too.”\n\nIt surprised Nick enough to make him smile at her. She looked ill, but she kept her chin up and her shoulders back and met Nick’s eyes with an unflinching gaze. The girl might have an unsettling crying habit, but she was pure steel.\n\n“You don’t have to do it either,” Alan said. “I can handle this on my own. I’ll get my things.”\n\nAs the door shut behind him, Nick knew how things would go: Alan would collect his box of instruments and have a few moments to himself so he could try to deal with what he had to do, and he wouldn’t be able to deal with it, and then he’d do it anyway. He would look white and strained and later he’d be sick, but he would never hesitate.\n\n“I can do it,” Mae said, as the door shut behind Alan. She sounded as if she was trying to convince herself.\n\nNick had to work fast.\n\n“I know that both of you can do it,” he said. Then he strolled over to Gerald, leaned in as if he was going to whisper a secret, and spoke in a perfectly audible voice. “But I want to do it.”\n\nGerald flinched at how close Nick was, and avoided his eyes. He was almost squirming in his chains to get away from Nick, and for the first time it occurred to Nick that he might be as badly frightened as he seemed.\n\nIf he was frightened, it was all to the good. He could be scared into telling them what he knew. It would please Alan if he could be spared unnecessary pain.\n\nNick slid into the man’s lap, getting as close as he could so he could scare him worse, listening to the scared hitch of Gerald’s breathing. He tossed his switchblade into the air and caught it, near the corner of Gerald’s eye, and saw the magician’s eyes swivel in an attempt to keep the knife in sight.\n\nAll Nick had was a knife. He had to do this quick, and rough, before Alan returned.\n\n“Do you think I won’t do it?” he asked, his voice low in the man’s ear.\n\nNo matter where Gerald looked, he kept his eyes resolutely away from Nick’s face. Nick stroked the blade idly down Gerald’s cheek and the man shuddered. Nick had been right. He was terrified.\n\n“I’m sure you will,” Gerald said, his voice shaking.\n\n“How many of you are there?”\n\n“Twelve!”\n\nThat was a good size for a magicians’ Circle. There were often fallings-out among magicians, power plays that left a Circle decimated. Black Arthur must be a strong leader to keep eleven others in check.\n\n“The Circle’s moving to London. Where are you moving?”\n\nGerald swallowed, hesitating. Nick slashed a line across his cheekbone and the magician made a sharp, pained sound. Nick intended to show him he meant business, and the cut was deep. Blood welled in the gash and streamed down Gerald’s cheek. Nick recognized the gasp behind him as Jamie’s, and when he heard the sound of someone rushing to the bathroom and retching he wasn’t particularly surprised. Alan hated to see people hurt too. If they had grown up differently, Alan might have been as squeamish as Jamie.\n\n“Central London,” Gerald gasped out. “I don’t know where exactly, I swear. I think our master bought a house near one of the big parks.”\n\nThe door opened again. Nick was somewhat surprised that Jamie had been able to come back this soon.\n\n“And Black Arthur’s still your leader.”\n\n“If Arthur’s alive, he’s the leader,” said a voice behind Nick. “That’s Arthur’s way.”\n\nNick looked over his shoulder and saw his mother. She seldom came downstairs unless Alan coaxed her, but she was here now, as if she had sensed that something momentous was happening. She was wearing a black shirt and trousers, and she had pushed her hair back from her face. It made her look almost normal.\n\nGerald was able to look at her. He stared at her with his mouth open, and she smiled snd \"0%at him. The confident, amused smile looked like someone had pasted the mouth of another woman onto her wan face.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nKì lạ với bí quyết giúp tránh xa đột quỵ ở tỉnh Nghệ An\nCardiohelptips\nĐừng bỏ qua đồng hồ bản sao Omega này khi nó giảm 90% chỉ 1 ngày\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

Chỉ cần thoa mỗi tối\n\n“You know who I am, then.”\n\n“Lady Livia,” Gerald breathed.\n\nMum kept smiling. “That’s what he used to call me. You were after my time, I think.”\n\n“Yes. I had nothing to do with what was done to you,” Gerald said, bloody but maintaining his calm.\n\nNick felt his lip curl. “He claims to be innocent of most things.”\n\nMum glanced over at Nick fleetingly. Her odd smile did not leave her lips, though her eyes were suddenly fixed and cold. She made an abrupt gesture of dismissal, as if she still called demons and had one in her power, and then she looked away from Nick immediately.\n\nIt was best to humor her. Nick flipped his bloody knife closed and swung lightly off Gerald, moving to the point farthest away from her in the room. Mum approached Gerald, walking lightly, and came to kneel at his feet.\n\n“Innocent?” she repeated, her smile looking more fixed and strange than ever.\n\nShe pulled her shirt down, revealing an expanse of dead-white skin and, over her heart, black against the smooth whiteness, the sigil of the Obsidian Circle. It reminded Nick of the sign above one of the Salisbury pubs, showing a woman in a giant hand. Drawn over Mum’s heart was a hand, cupping not a woman but the world. There was a suggestion of tension about the fingers of the hand, as if they were just about to clench over the world and crush it.\n\nMum reached up and drew down Gerald’s shirt, stretching the cotton out of shape. There over his heart was the same hand, holding the same world.\n\n“Nobody who wears this mark is innocent,” Mum whispered.\n\nGerald, blood still running down his face, sagged a little in his chair. “You’re not going to help me, are you?”\n\n“No,” said Mum. “I don’t owe you anything. How is Arthur?”\n\n“I don’t think he’s changed,” Gerald said. “He talks about you, often. He never wanted to hurt you. He chose you—”\n\nMum laughed and leaped to her feet lightly, as if she were young. “I chose him. That’s the problem with wanting someone who will change the world for you. Choose a man with that much power over the world, and all he really wants is more power.” She turned away and went over to Mae, standing so close to her that she could have slipped an arm around her waist.\n\n“It’s probably best to change the world yourself,” she added. “Nobody should risk being a sacrifice.”\n\nIt was strange seeing Mum lean close to Mae, as if she was a normal woman with someone she liked, but Nick didn’t have time to think about that. Alan would be back soon. He flipped open his knife again and gave Gerald a meaningful look.\n\n“What else do you want to know?” Gerald asked wearily.\n\n“When does the Circle plan to move to London?” Nick demanded.\n\nGerald hesitated.\n\nNick moved forward, relentless as the tide. He leaned down to Gerald and closed his free hand around the magician’s throat.\n\n“I’ve been talking a lot about my feelings recently,” he informed Gerald in a conversational tone. “I don’t really get scared. Want to know what else I don’t feel?”\n\nGerald’s voice was a whisper through the vise grip on his throat. “What?”\n\nNick trailed his knife down the cotton of Gerald’s T-shirt until the blade rested against Gerald’s stomach. The magician trembled and closed his eyes. Cut someone in the belly, and they could live for hours afterward. They just wouldn’t like life much.\n\nNick leaned closer to Gerald, laughed in his ear, and murmured, “Pity.”\n\n“Nick!” said Alan from the doorway. “What are you doing?”\n\n“Saving you some trouble,” Nick answered, and then looked over his shoulder.\n\nAlan had one hand clenched on the door frame, knuckles white, as if only his grip on the door was keeping him on his feet. He looked as if someone had punched him in the stomach.\n\n“Get away from him!”\n\nNick released Gerald’s throat and pocketed his switchblade in one move, abandoning the magician and walking toward his brother. Alan flinched, and Nick stopped.\n\n“What’s the big deal?” Nick asked roughly, not sure what words would help and what words would upset Alan more. “I don’t — I don’t know what I did wrong. It bothers you, it doesn’t bother me, I thought I could do it and you’d be — I thought you’d be happy.”\n\nAlan closed his eyes and swallowed, and something about his face reminded Nick of the way Gerald had looked as he waited for the knife to come down.\n\n“It should bother you,” Alan said in a low voice.\n\nNick was suddenly furious. He was sick of this whole business. He wanted to kill this man, not chat with him. He wanted Alan to stop telling him what he should do and start telling him the truth; it seemed like his whole life was slipping through his hands and all he had left were lies and rules he did not understand.\n\nHe didn’t want to look at his brother. He didn’t need to be here.\n\n“Fine. You deal with this,” he said between his teeth. “You guys have fun. I’m going to go wash all this blood off.”\n\nHe watched for Alan’s flinch this time, and then shoved past him out of the door. He climbed the stairs wearily, pulling off a T-shirt that had been grubby from the roofs of Salisbury before he’d spilled someone else’s blood on it. He was so sick of Alan having this mark, so sick of Mae being always around and always on the verge of becoming a problem between him and his brother. Nick wanted all of this over, and the magician dead.\n\nThe shower hissed at him like a chorus of snakes when he twisted the knob and set the water running. He got in and bowed his head under the spray.\n\nHe was under the water for about a minute when he heard the gunshot.\n\nNick grabbed for his jeans and realized as he was pulling them on that his knives must have fallen out when he was getting undressed. There was no time to go back for them; he ran down the stairs empty-handed with the shower hissing behind him.\n\nThere was a wolf in the sitting room.\n\nIt was big and brindled, with thick fur that tufted into white at the places where its hackles rose. Its bared teeth were sharp and yellow. It was circling Gerald’s chair, and from deep within its barrel chest rose a long, continuous snarl. It was too big, its teeth too sharp, and the snarl too menacing. It was probably a magician whom some demon had given enough power to make a very convincing illusion. Convincing enough to kill.\n\nGerald’s voice was shaking. “Let me loose! The Circle will kill me before they let me talk. Don’t let me die without a fight. I can help you. Let me go!”\n\nMum was backed into a corner with Mae and Jamie, as if the wolf had herded them there. Alan was standing by the magician’s chair with his gun trained on the wolf. Nick edged forward, scooping up a discarded chain from the pile they’d used to truss up Gerald, and saw the wolf’s head move a fraction. It fixed its yellow eyes on Alan and snarled.\n\nNick had already heard a gunshot. Alan did not miss: If the wolf was not dead, then it was bulletproof.\n\nThe wolf’s snarl became a stuttering, ugly growl that sounded like a dying car engine. Its haunches bunched up for a spring.\n\nNick wrapped the end of the chain around his fist and lunged forward. He brought the chain down hard against the wolf’s back and heard the animal yelp, then yanked the chain back, over his head, and as the wolf swung to face him he dived for it before it could leap at him. They went down together, the wolf’s growl reverberating through its body and its body crashing down on Nick’s. Its claws scored burning lines down Nick’s chest, and its teeth snapped an inch from his face.\n\nHe threw his chain over the creature’s head, caught the other end and twisted the makeshift choke chain hard in both hands. The wolf choked, the cold weight of the chain hurting Nick’s hands. He kept almost grabbing big handfuls of fur and the wolf lunged, trying to find a way to breathe, shoving hard against the single barrier of the chain.\n\nThe sound of Alan’s gun rang out again, even though he must know by now it wouldn’t work. Nick turned his face to one side and felt the wolf’s hot breath on his face, felt its teeth graze his cheek. He pulled the chain tight with both his hands and tried to hold the wolf at arm’s length while the creature snarled and tried to throw itself at him. Nick pulled the wolf on top of him, rolling with it in a nightmare of claws and straining muscle, trying to wrestle it and strangle it at once. The wolf twisted its head around and sank its teeth in Nick’s wrist.\n\nNick did not have time to scream. He pulled the choke chain closed, a band of iron around the wolf’s neck. A howl was choked off in the wolf’s throat and the fierce thrashing of its body started to seem less like an attack and more like desperation. It kept trying to breathe. Pain lanced through Nick’s arms with the effort of keeping the chain tight and ever tighter, the wolf’s eyes were bulging in its head, and suddenly it collapsed forward against Nick’s chest.\n\nInstead of a wolf, a woman fell against Nick, her long hair tumbling into his face. He pushed the body off him and sat up with difficulty, his arms suddenly feeling weak, and let the chain slip out of his hands.\n\nIt occurred to him when it was too late that if he’d only had his sword, if he’d been able to make her bleed before he killed her, he could have used her blood to paint over Alan’s mark. Alan would have been safe.\n\nHe climbed wearily to his feet, unsurprised to see Jamie and Mae staring at him with shocked faces. They weren’t used to death yet. Mum turned her eyes away when he glanced at her. She looked sick.\n\nAlan grabbed his shoulder and spun him around with one hand. He looked furious.\n\n“Where is it?” he demanded, his eyes blazing. “What have you done with it?”\n\n“What?” said Nick. “What are you talking about?”\n\n“Your talisman!” Alan shouted. He was shaking. “Do you know what could have happened? How long have you had it off? Tell me you just took it off now, Nick. Tell me that much.”\n\nOf course. His talisman. Now that Alan said it, Nick was completely aware that it was gone. In some corner of his mind he’d known for some time that the small, constant burden had been lifted. Its irritating presence had been an absence ever since — ever since—\n\n“I took it off to call Liannan,” he said slowly. “I left it in a building site.”\n\nColor drained from Alan’s face, his veins standing out like blue lines struck across white paper. “You haven’t worn your talisman for a week.”\n\n“You gave your talisman away.”\n\n“I—” Alan lowered his voice. “I didn’t throw it away! I meant it to be for a couple of hours. A week, Nick! Anything could have happened. God.”\n\nNow that Nick had killed something, he felt better. He’d done something at last, something useful, and even though his arms ached and his wounds stung he felt calmer; some of his simmering rage had burned away in the fight. Alan was worried about him, and that wasn’t bad either.\n\n“Sorry,” he offered at length. “I’ll get one later.”\n\nAlan was hanging on to his shoulder as if Nick had almost walked out into traffic and Alan had only just been able to catch him in time. As Nick spoke he breathed out deeply, once, and shut his eyes. He slipped out of Alan’s grasp as gently as he could and stood watching him uncertainly, wondering what he’d done wrong now.\n\n“You’re lucky your big brother learns from his mistakes,” Alan said at length. “Come on upstairs. I got some spares at the Goblin Market.”\n\nHe limped toward the door and Nick followed him for a few steps, then stopped. Alan threw a glance over his shoulder that was more silent command than look; Nick took another step forward without even thinking.\n\n“Wait,” he said. “There could be more magicians around. We shouldn’t leave this one alone with two tourists and her.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nThỏa thích uốn nhuộm!

She did transfer her smile to Alan, that was the thing: If there had been no hope for Alan at all, it would have been less of a dilemma.\n\nNick let them smile at each other and leaned back against the wall, examining the claw marks of the wolf. The deepest were on his stomach, on one side of his belly button. Nick looked at the red grooves and was distantly pleased that the wolf had been too busy trying to bite him to claw him open. Intestines belonged on the inside.\n\nThe room was a mess. Chains were scattered about the place, the rug was twisted like bedsheets after his fight with the wolf, and their prisoner seemed on the point of hysterics. The other magician lay crumpled at Gerald’s feet.\n\n“We could just kill him now,” Nick said, and watched the slow shudder work its way through Gerald’s body, from shaking shoulders to trembling lips.\n\nAlan looked impatient. “We can kill him for Jamie.”\n\n“No,” Nick snarled.\n\nAlan looked at him for a long moment, as if by making Nick his single focus he could somehow keep him safe, and then his strained face smoothed out. “We can talk about that later,” he said softly. “First let’s just go upstairs and get that talisman. We’ll only be gone a minute, and — I want you to have it. I don’t want you in any danger.”\n\n“Good luck with that one. I just strangled a wolf to death five minutes ago,” Nick said gruffly. Alan smiled, and they both understood that Nick had given in.\n\nJust on this one thing. He’d come and get a talisman if it made Alan feel better, but he wasn’t going to put up with any of this nonsense about Jamie going first. Alan had sacrificed enough for Jamie already.\n\n“C’mon,” said Alan, and Nick moved to follow him.\n\n“This is just a thought,” Jamie called after them. “But while you’re up there, you might see if you can find a shirt.”\n\nWhen they went into Alan’s room, Nick could not help casting an uneasy eye over Alan’s bookshelves. He hadn’t had a chance to put Alan’s precious photo back in its hiding place yet, and he had a sudden moment of foreboding. If Alan tried to sneak a look at the stupid picture he liked gazing at so much, he’d find out what Nick had done.\n\nIt didn’t matter if he did find out. Nick had a right to discover the truth, but somehow he didn’t like the idea of how Alan would look at him if he knew.\n\nHe turned deliberately away from the bookcase and occupied himself shrugging into one of Alan’s baggy old T-shirts, lying slung over a chair. He went to lean against the wall, looking out of the window where the sun was going down, the sky brimming dark blue over the gray roofs of London.\n\nAlan knelt down by his wardrobe and took out the box where he kept his protective charms, beginning to sift through them slowly and thoughtfully as if he was telling rosary beads. Or as if he was afraid to look up.\n\n“I’m serious about taking Jamie’s mark off,” he said slowly.\n\n“You’re being stupid.”\n\n“You don’t understand—”\n\n“Yeah, I don’t understand. I don’t understand why you’re being stupid!”\n\nNick’s voice rose in a shout, a harsh, flat sound like a whip cracking or a door slamming. If he’d been shouting at anyone but Alan he knew he would have seen the effect of the shout: seen the sound seep into their bones and make them shudder, make them give in.\n\nIt was different with Alan. Threatening him wouldn’t work; he didn’t seem to care about saving himself. He would have to find some other way to make Alan do what he wanted. Nick looked at his brother and suddenly felt icy calm.\n\nHe knew what threat to use.\n\n“Here it is,” Alan said in a quiet, pleased voice, as if Nick hadn’t shouted at him a moment ago. He got to his feet with his usual care, a flash of pain drawing a deep line between his brows, then smiled and limped over to Nick.\n\nThe talisman was dangling from Alan’s left wrist like a bracelet. There was a crawling sensation of dread in Nick’s stomach just looking at it, but when Alan beckoned, he bowed his head and let his brother slip the talisman around his neck. He felt like an animal going back into harness.\n\nThe talisman burned where it touched his skin. Nick set his teeth at the return of the dull, constant pain and looked into Alan’s face, which showed uncomplicated relief.\n\n“Do you know what I’ll do if you don’t take that mark off?” he asked. He did not shout this time. He lowered his voice so it was a very private and personal threat, a soft promise of pain.\n\nAlan recognized it. “Nick,” he said, startled and a little pleading.\n\nNick had to make him understand.\n\n“You care so much about Mum? She was an Obsidian Circle magician. She still has the sigil. Her lifeblood would save you.”\n\nAlan took a quick, unsteady breath, his thin chest rising and falling sharply. He was trembling.\n\n“I’d do it,” Nick swore to him. “I’d trade her for you. I’d do it in a heartbeat. I won’t let you die!”\n\nAlan’s mouth twisted viciously. “Why not? More useful to you than Olivia, am I?”\n\nHe was watching Nick in the same hurt, horror-struck way he had when he’d seen Nick with the magician. Nick looked away and out of the window again, to where the sun was sinking, shadow closing its claws over the houses one by one. He fought with black incomprehension: Alan wanted a particular response from him, and he didn’t know what it was.\n\n“Well — well, you are more useful than she is,” he said haltingly.\n\n“How can you—,” Alan began in a furious voice.\n\nHe was interrupted by the sound of Mae screaming. It wasn’t a scream for help. It was the scream of someone in pain.\n\nAlan palmed the knife from his wrist sheath and held it out before Nick could say a word. Nick closed his fingers around the hilt and ran, taking the stairs three at a time, and bolted into the sitting room, throwing open the door and running almost directly into Mum.\n\nShe flung up an arm as if Nick was the threat.\n\n“Don’t touch me!”\n\n“I don’t want to touch you!” Nick snarled. “What happened?”\n\nMum didn’t bother replying. It was pretty obvious what had happened. Their sitting room was torn apart. Someone had broken the window and shredded the rug. Mae was lying at an awkward angle on the floor with blood all over her face, struggling to get up as Jamie tried to push her down. The chair that had contained Gerald the magician was on its side, the chains that had bound him were a gleaming silver path that pointed to the shattered window.\n\nOutside the window and utterly beyond reach was a huge bird, the curving shape of amber wings outlined in the setting sun, flaring gold as he flew. Nick imagined that its talons were fairly impressive as well, judging by what the creature had done to the rug and Mae’s face.\n\n“Mae,” Nick said. “Are you—”\n\nAlan stumbled down the last step on the stairs and was almost instantly at Mae’s side. Nick fell silent and went for the first-aid kit, passing it to Alan without a word. Alan accepted it with a nod, murmuring comforting nonsense to Mae as he taped the cut across her cheek carefully closed. Mae stopped fighting to get up and bore the taping without a sound, and Nick watched her whisper reassurance back to Alan, watched their shared smiles.\n\n“I’m really okay. Thanks,” Mae murmured, low and grateful, Alan’s musician’s fingers held lightly against the curve of her jaw. “He turned into a freaking bird. I couldn’t believe it!” Her voice turned frustrated. “I couldn’t stop him. I couldn’t do a thing.”\n\n“It’s not your fault,” Alan assured her.\n\nHe was right. There was nothing she could have done. If Gerald could transform into an animal, he had a whole lot more power than Nick had thought. He had so much power that it must mean he’d wanted to be captured.\n\nHe’d wanted to be brought here.\n\nThey’d been played for fools. And that wasn’t even the worst part.\n\nNick gazed with building fury at his brother, bent solicitously over Mae and acting so very concerned.\n\nHe said, “You did this.”\n\nAlan stood up at once. “Come outside,” he said, in that calm, reasonable voice of his. Nick strode forward and grabbed Alan’s elbow, dragging him to the front door and only stopping when his brother almost fell on the threshold.\n\nHe steadied Alan with his free hand and then stepped back. For a moment his throat was too tight to find words.\n\n“You did this,” he repeated at last.\n\nHe remembered Alan’s face, smoothing into a bland mask when Nick refused to let him take Jamie’s mark off. We’ll only be gone a minute. I don’t want you in any danger. He’d been worried, and he’d used that to make Nick do exactly what he wanted. Once he’d brought Nick upstairs, he’d kept him upstairs with that little line about Jamie. He’d known Nick would argue with him.\n\nHe’d deliberately let the magician go, and now he was facing Nick with that careful look on his face, trying to calm Nick down without actually giving anything away, waiting to see what lie would work this time.\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean that you got the only two people capable of restraining that magician out of the room! You did it, and you did it on purpose, because you wanted to keep the demon’s mark that is going to kill you. I know all that. I just don’t know why. And I want to know why, Alan. I’m going to know why.”\n\nAlan looked at Nick’s face and obviously saw that denials weren’t going to do him any good.\n\n“Because of what that messenger said,” he answered quietly. “Because I have a plan. Would you rather I didn’t have one?”\n\nNick grabbed the collar of Alan’s shirt and pushed him up against the door frame with one hand.\n\n“I’d rather you didn’t get yourself killed!”\n\nAlan looked up at him, pale and silent, and Nick realized how this would look to anyone watching. A crippled boy, stumbling and obviously upset, being menaced by a vicious thug. He felt vicious; he would’ve hit Alan if that would have made him stop.\n\nOnly he knew his brother. Pain didn’t scare him, and nothing could make him stop.\n\n“Mum’s not worth this,” he snarled. “Nothing’s worth this.”\n\n“Some things are.”\n\nNick did not shake him, no matter how much he was tempted. He let go of his brother’s shirt and stepped back. He thought Alan looked a little relieved.\n\n“It won’t take long for Gerald to report back to the Obsidian Circle,” Nick said. “They’ll be coming soon. We can’t be here. Do you have a plan for that?”\n\nHe glared at his brother, and Alan looked back, pained but still calm, still plotting something.\n\n“I do,” said Alan. “I told you I needed to see what Merris was experimenting with. She lives on the Isle of Wight. We can go there. We can escape the magicians that way.”\n\nNick looked away from him then, leaning his cheek against the steel door frame and looking out onto the narrow gray street, just another street among the hundreds of streets he had lived on and would never see again. Alan was still thinking about the best way to help Mum, and then it would be the best way to help Jamie, and all Nick wanted to do was take Alan and run. If they kept moving, maybe the magicians wouldn’t get a chance to put the last mark on Alan and finish him off. Nick didn’t care about anything else.\n\nHe opened his mouth and could not find words.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nTrĩ nội, trĩ ngoại 20 năm cũng phải teo với cách này\nSuckhoevungcao\nCơn bão về chiếc đống hồ Omega bản sao, chỉ bán duy nhất 1 ngày\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

You can’t stop me. If you raise a hand to me I’ll shoot you in the leg. I’m going to Merris’s because I need her help and nothing you can say will change my mind. You don’t have to come with me.”\n\n“Yes, I do,” Nick snapped.\n\nWhat a stupid thing for Alan to say. They had never been separated for longer than those few days last Christmas; Nick always knew where Alan was and usually knew that he was close. That was how things were and how they were going to stay. Alan was his brother, and if he was set on carrying out his little plan, risking himself to save Mum, then Nick had to be with him to make sure he was safe.\n\nAlan looked almost too worn out to smile but he did anyway, a faint, sweet smile that lingered in his eyes. “All right.”\n\nHe nodded slightly, as if they were businessmen who had come to an understanding. Then he turned and went back into the hall, limping a little more than usual, as if he was carrying something heavy. Nick followed him. It was clear that Alan needed to be watched. He’d meant what he’d told Alan: He would sacrifice Mum if he had to.\n\nIt didn’t matter what Alan wanted. It only mattered that Alan lived.\n\n10\n\nThe House of Mezentius\n\nTHEY WERE ALL IN THE CAR FIVE MINUTES LATER, abandoning everything that would not fit into the couple of old schoolbags they had in the boot. Nick had secured his new favorite sword at his belt, and Alan had slipped his family pictures, and the book with the hidden picture inside, into one of the bags.\n\n“What’s that?” Nick had said, perversely wanting to see Alan lie to him.\n\n“Just something I’m reading,” Alan answered with a wry, plausible smile. Nick was suddenly reminded of Gerald the magician and had to turn away.\n\nNow Camden was passing them by so fast that streets and lights had turned into a multicolored river, flashing yellow and orange over a smooth stream of gray.\n\nNick turned the car south toward the M3, hearing a clank as he moved into fourth. He’d have to see to the car sometime, though it was unlikely they would have time for mechanics in the near future.\n\nIt would take about two hours to get to Southampton if they were lucky with traffic, and then they could take the ferry to the Isle of Wight.\n\nNick was still thinking about the traffic when Alan said in a soft voice, “Nick, you get horribly seasick.”\n\n“Don’t be ridiculous,” Nick said.\n\nHe didn’t remember ever being vuo; on a boat. Running from magicians did not leave a lot of time for sailing the high seas, but the idea sounded implausible. Nick was never sick, and even if he had been, they were hardly going to change their plans because of a tiny thing like seasickness. He wasn’t letting Alan go off on his own.\n\n“We took you on a boat once when you were little, and it was—” Alan bit his lip. “You coughed up blood. I thought you were going to die.”\n\n“I didn’t,” Nick pointed out. “And if I was little, I imagine I’ve grown out of it by now.” He glanced over at Alan, whose profile was tense and unhappy. If Alan was so concerned about him, he thought, he might try telling him the truth once in a while instead of wasting time protecting him from boats.\n\nMae, Jamie, and Mum were silent in the backseat. After about an hour along the M3 and into the gathering night, Nick glanced in the mirror and saw Mum looking at him, her gaze steady and cold.\n\nAlan seemed so ready to die to save her. Nick couldn’t understand it, and he wasn’t about to let it happen.\n\nThe ferry at Southampton’s second terminal was a huge white and red edifice, more like a tin house floating on the water than a boat. There seemed to be a jolly cloud painted on one side, as if they were all off on a day trip to the beach.\n\nThere were very few other passengers at this time of night. They waited until everyone else was aboard; nobody was in the mood to deal with strangers, Nick least of all. He strode onboard last, lagging behind even Alan’s limping step, and walked toward the railing at the side of the ferry as the whistle blew. He lifted his face to the cold wind and hoped everyone would understand that he wanted to be left alone.\n\nThe boat lurched as it set off. Nick felt his stomach tilt with it, and a moment of dizziness passed over him, a disoriented feeling similar to that of standing up too fast and having all the blood rush to your head. He deliberately did not look at the gray expanse of water, leaning heavily against the railing and clenching his hand hard around it. He squeezed the metal so tightly his knuckles went white and his fingers ached, and he concentrated on the pain. Having a focus cleared his head.\n\nHe felt the plunge of the hull against the waves in the pit of his stomach. He tried to count the waves but they kept coming, a succession of waves battering the boat, the whole sea nothing but currents under relentless currents.\n\nMae left Mum’s side to come and stand in front of Nick. Her face wavered in front of his eyes, bobbing as if she was underwater.\n\n“Are you all right?” she asked. “We’ve only been moving for a minute and the sea’s calm, but you’ve gone all green. Do you want to go below deck, or…maybe you’d like a basin?”\n\n“Don’t be stupid,” Nick said roughly, and tried to let go of the railing. His hands felt oddly numb, as if they did not belong to him, and then the boat creaked over another wave and he staggered, almost going down on his knees. Consciousness seemed to be sliding across the deck and away from him.\n\nAlan turned, as if that was a cue he’d been waiting for, and moved toward Nick. The way he limped did not synchronize with the way the boat rocked, and for a moment Alan seemed like the only still point in a world full of endless sickening motion. Nick tried to hold on. Soon Alan could get to him and tell him what was happening.\n\nThe world was moving so much it was blurring into a meaningless mess of color and sound. There was a moment of small centralized pain, someone’s fingernails digging into Nick’s skin, and someone’s voice, high, saying: “Alan, Jamie! Quick—”\n\nThe world fell away as if the boat had tipped over and left them in the crashing darkness of the sea. There was nothing but darkness and confusion for a long moment, until Nick realized he was lying on the deck and retching, as if he had really been underwater and he had to cough up water to live. He did not taste water in his mouth, only the sharp bitterness of bile.\n\nBitterness only lasted an instant, though. Nick was used to being in complete command of his body, being strong and able to use all his strength. It was odd now, he thought in a drifting sort of way, to feel so helpless, to be so disconnected from his body. He was only sure that he had a body because of a strange pain that seemed part of the disconnection and because he was so cold.\n\n“Nick,” said Alan’s voice, compelling and comforting at once.\n\nSlowly, through the chill, Nick felt his hand held tight in Alan’s, his cheek pressed against the rough denim covering Alan’s knee. He became aware of his head as his own, a distinct shape, because of his brother’s hand stroking his hair.\n\n“Nick,” Alan said again. “It’s all right, Nick.”\n\nIt was all right. Nick thought about this and decided that what Alan said was true. He’d never been helpless before, not since he could remember, but now he was and everything was all right. He didn’t normally let people touch him, but he could not stop it now. He did not have to speak, he was not able to move, all he could do was lie there and have his brother hold him, hunched over and shielding him from the world. His brother’s hand was light in his hair, his arm circling Nick’s shoulders as well as he could, and his voice in Nick’s ear was a warm soothing lifeline in the midst of the cold hissing of all the currents in the sea.\n\n“Hold on, Nick. It’s only twenty minutes until we get there. Just hold on.”\n\nNick tried to do what Alan wanted and hold on to his brother’s hand, but he couldn’t feel his fingers properly. He looked, though, and Alan was still holding Nick’s hand, so perhaps that would be enough to make Alan happy. Nick vomited again, too cold and far away to care. He pressed his forehead against the inside of his brother’s wrist and let the drowning darkness pull him down again.\n\nWhen he was next aware of anything, it was of being in a car that was jolting to a stop. His vision was hazy and he looked around desperately, as if by jerking his head hard enough he could make himself see, but then he realized that Alan was still holding his hand.\n\n“Alan,” he mumbled, and the orange light of a streetlamp caught Alan’s glasses. The flash dimmed and Nick saw Alan’s face bending over him in the flickering shadows. “Where are we?”\n\n“We’re in a taxi going from West Cowes to Carisbrooke village,” Alan answered softly, as if he was talking nonsense words to a child he was very fond of. “We’re going to Merris’s house. How are you feeling?”\n\n“As if my body doesn’t belong to me,” Nick said.\n\n“I’m sorry for bringing you onto that boat.”\n\nNick levered himself up on one elbow. “Not your fault. You warned me, I just didn’t think I was pathetic enough to collapse because of a little queasiness.”\n\n“You’re an idiot,” said Alan, relaxing enough to smile at him. “But you’re not pathetic.”\n\nThere was a flicker of movement in the corner of Nick’s eye. He looked around sharply, dropping Alan’s hand, and saw Jamie and Mae sitting on the flip-down leather seats opposite them. He realized properly for the first time that they really were in a cab. He looked beyond the clouded glass to see the tired profile of the cab driver and the black fall of Mum’s hair in the passenger seat.\n\n“How are you feeling, Nick?” Jamie inquired, shifting uneasily on his seat. He and Mae looked rather alike just now, both staring at him with wide, frightened eyes. He recognized with a shock the fact that they both looked worried.\n\n“Can you walk?” asked Mae, being more practical. “We’re here.”\n\nHe nodded, and Mae opened the car door. Nick got out, straightened, and did not know what was keeping him up. When he looked down, it was his legs and feet as usual.\n\nThere was a high stone wall in front of them and an ornate gate. The stones in the wall glittered with mica. The iron of the gate was shaped into trees and snakes and women. The whole purpose of the walls and gate seemed to be decoration, but this was simply a distraction from the fact that the walls were very high and there were wicked-looking spikes on the gate. There was jagged glass gleaming on top of the walls, almost hidden by the leaves of trees behind them. It reminded Nick of Liannan, with her curtain of hair and sharp teeth.\n\nHe had to lean against the cab. He should not have stood up so soon; he tried to move and Alan was beside him. Nick must have been sagging, because he was eye level with the first button on Alan’s shirt.\n\n“Mae, help me,” Alan ordered, and Mae was suddenly at Nick’s side.\n\nNick dimly approved of Alan’s choice. Mae was certainly better able to bear his weight than Jamie, and as for Mum, who was taller and stronger than either of them, she would not have touched Nick no matter who asked. Then his head lolled forward, his neck feeling like a thick tube of spaghetti. He was not going to be sick again; he just wanted to lie down until he remembered how to work his own body.\n\n“Jamie,” Alan said, his voice soothing for Nick’s benefit, even though he was speaking to someone else. “Go and press the intercom button. Say ‘My name is one.’”\n\n“One?” Jamie asked, blinking. “One what?”\n\n“Jamie! Nick is going to fall over!”\n\n“Right. I’m sorry,” said Jamie, shaking his head and stepping backward, almost walking into the tree and turning to scurry toward the gate. Nick heard his voice, seeming much farther away than it should have, saying that his name was one.< { wary div height=\"0 %\">\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nTrĩ nội, trĩ ngoại 20 năm cũng phải teo với cách này\nSuckhoevungcao\nCơn bão về chiếc đống hồ Omega bản sao, chỉ bán duy nhất 1 ngày\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

Beyond was a garden with trees weighed down by their late-May green burdens, and crazy paving that stretched on until it was lost from view.\n\nThey went slowly down the garden path, Nick’s awareness of what was going on ebbing and fading with every step. The garden was a wild tangle that had clearly been left to decay for years; briars formed nightmare patterns against Nick’s eyelids as his eyes closed. Alan’s voice cut across his consciousness, saying his name, and Nick opened his eyes again with an effort.\n\nIn front of them now was a large white house, rising above them like a sheer white cliff. It was so large that it seemed to demand decoration, the decency of pillars and balconies, but here behind the gates there was no such pretense. There was only the severe white building, stretching up five floors. Above the large door were letters raised in gold.\n\nThe words swam before Nick’s eyes, gleaming fish that wanted to escape and would not form a coherent pattern, and then they stilled. Nick could feel his body now and it felt heavy, so heavy that he could not hold himself up.\n\nThe gold letters stayed for a moment, pinned up against the blackness, when his eyelids dropped and he fell forward.\n\nTHE HOUSE OF MEZENTIUS, the shining words read, and below that: THEIR NAME IS LEGION.\n\nNick woke in darkness to the sound of screams.\n\nThe darkness he solved by reaching out and turning on the lamp on the table beside his bed, but the screams were different. He sat up, noting with relief that his muscles and sinews now remembered they were his and obeyed him. He slipped out of the tangled embrace of sheets to have a look around. The room had a high ceiling, and little scalloped bits at the corners of said ceiling. His bed was big, with a carved oak headboard.\n\nThe screams were faint. Nick judged that they were muffled by thick walls, rather than all that far away.\n\nThe heavy door, also polished oak, slid open. Nick reached for a sword that was not there and was glad to see Alan. He was also glad to see that Alan had his sword.\n\nAlan smiled, laugh lines leaping out from the corners of his eyes. “I see you’re feeling better.” He threw Nick a little heap of fabric, which Nick unfolded and saw was a shirt, the crisp buttoned kind you should wear with a suit. He was about to refuse it when he glanced down at his T-shirt and saw that it was stained with vomit and blood. He didn’t want to know if he’d hacked up blood. He just changed shirts.\n\nOnce he had done so, he gestured around at the room. “All this is very posh.”\n\n“It’s Merris Cromwell’s house.”\n\nNick supposed that made sense. Everybody knew Merris had money, even though he hadn’t known she had this much.\n\n“Where are the others?”\n\nAlan looked pleased that he’d asked. “Nearby. Mum’s asleep, Merris gave her something to calm her down, but the others are wondering how you are. We’ve all been put in the north wing, so we’re pretty close to {ret dogether. Do you want to go see them?”\n\nNick shrugged, and Alan led the way. The north wing seemed to be mostly corridors so wide they almost qualified as rooms, the walls sleek and white and the wooden floors all dark from years and polish. They found Mae and Jamie in a room reminiscent of Nick’s, with the same solemn-looking bed and crenulated ceiling. Jamie was sitting cross-legged on the bed, and Mae was pacing across a fluffy white rug that looked like a decapitated polar bear.\n\n“We should go check on him,” she said as Nick opened the door.\n\nJamie nodded in his direction. “I think he’s probably all right.”\n\nMae looked around and did not blush. Nick liked that, the way she felt no need to pretend either indifference or exaggerated concern. She just nodded at him.\n\nHe was not used to big houses like this. He was used to small, shabby houses and flats, places with so few rooms and such thin walls that he always knew where Alan was. Now he was in wide open spaces under vaulted ceilings, and he was noticing too many things about this girl. The strangeness of it all made him feel irritated and uncomfortable. He slouched against the wall and looked deliberately through Mae. After a few moments she moved away from the coldness of his fixed gaze, toward Alan.\n\nIt didn’t make Nick feel any better. He felt restless suddenly, and as he tuned out the others’ voices and wished for something to do, he registered again the sound that had woken him. Coming to him through heavy doors and solid walls, through all the expensive privacy of this house, were faint but unmistakable screams.\n\nIt was obvious that the rest of them couldn’t hear it. He should probably tell Alan.\n\n“There is someone being tortured in this house.”\n\nAlan gave a guilty start, and it was clear to Nick that he at least already knew.\n\n“That’s not entirely true,” he said hastily.\n\n“Tortured?” exclaimed Jamie.\n\nNick shrugged. “Sounds like that to me.”\n\n“Alan,” Mae said, in a tone of command rather than appeal. “Where are we?”\n\nAlan looked defeated already, as if some terrible fate was rushing upon them, something as impossible to reason with or escape from as a storm spilling darkness across the sky.\n\n“This is the House of Mezentius,” he said.\n\n“That’s what it said above the door,” Nick agreed. “Who’s Mezentius?”\n\nAlan seemed to be having trouble with the words. “He was an Etruscan king in a legend,” he said slowly. “He had living people bound face-to-face with dead bodies and left to starve.”\n\n“He sounds a charming host,” said Nick. “I thought you said this was Merris Cromwell’s house.”\n\n“Merris runs the house,” Alan answered in a low voice. “It’s her job to organize everything here, to keep everything…contained.”\n\n“Well she’s not doing a very good job, is she?” Jamie exclaimed. “If there’s someone being tortured in here.”\n\n“That person’s here of their own free will,” Alan told him.\n\nHis eyes looked more bruised and sad with every word dragged out of him, and Nick felt the impulse to silence all the questions that were hurting his brother. He’d always trusted Alan to know best, trusted that Alan would sooner or later tell Nick everything he needed to know. He thought of that hidden picture, though, and about him letting that magician go. There were some things Alan never said anything about. He wondered what secret Alan was hiding this time.\n\nHe kept quiet, and let Mae and Jamie keep pushing for answers.\n\n“Do you know the person who’s screaming?”\n\n“Why would someone come here to be tortured?”\n\nMae demanded, “Can’t you just show us what’s going on?”\n\nAlan looked almost gray. “I can,” he said. “But you don’t want to see. I swear, you don’t want to see.”\n\nThere was another slight movement of unease in Nick’s gut. He could still shut them both up.\n\nHe hesitated a second too long and gave Mae the chance to make up her own mind.\n\n“Let me decide that for myself. I want to see.”\n\nAlan walked down the staircase heavily, as if he was carrying a large burden that he did not expect to be able to put down for some time. Mae walked with a firm step beside him, Jamie was hanging back, and Nick became more and more convinced that he did not like this place.\n\nThe staircase was wide, a gleaming marble flight of the kind that women swept down in the sappy movies Alan liked. Only instead of leading to a ballroom, it ended in a hall with the same dark polished floors and severe white walls as the corridors in the north wing. Nick kept trying to work out why this place jarred on him so much, and then he got it. The north wing with its four-poster beds and fancy ceilings was a disguise, and this house was as much of a facade as the decorative gate outside.\n\nThis was not a stately home. This place was an institution.\n\nThe screaming was getting closer.\n\nAfter a moment’s analysis, Nick decided that it was just one person screaming. It was a woman, and she sounded young, or at least not old. The hall opened into more corridors as they went along, and Nick was amazed that he had not realized before how clinical the corridors were, perfectly upkept, with no pictures or even creaking old radiators to lend them personality. They passed a few simple wooden doors, but Alan kept going, and their little group silently followed him.\n\nEveryone could hear the screams now.\n\nThey turned a corner in the winding passageways, and the screams suddenly had a definite location. They were coming from a large metal door down the corridor, on the left. There were no other curves remaining in the corridor, and Nick saw it stretching on into dimness. Glinting at intervals in the dimness were other metallic doors, armored so they bulged out of their door frames, looking forbidding and utterly out of place.\n\nAs they drew level with the first metallic door, the screaming stopped.\n\nThe scream was cut off so abruptly Nick thought that the person screaming must have died. There was a small window in the door, though, wire forming tiny squares inside two sheets of glass, and when they peered inside they saw no dead bodies.\n\nThere were two people in the room. There was a woman kneeling on the floor, and there was a man chained to a wall.\n\nNick’s first reaction was disbelief. This house might be an institution, but it was clearly civilized and organized. It seemed unbelievable that these quiet corridors could lead to dungeons.\n\nThen he looked at the prisoner properly.\n\nAt first sight he was a normal man. His face was deeply lined and his body was stooped in his chains, so he looked old even though most of his hair was brown. He wore old clothes, and a beard covered most of his face.\n\nAs they all stood staring, the man’s flat black eyes darted toward the window in the door. His expression did not change.\n\nHis eyes did. They bulged in his eye sockets, bulged until they seemed to bulge out of his eye sockets, and then Nick realized they were not bulging at all. The man’s eyes had seemed almost like normal eyes at first, but now the pupils expanded as if someone had tipped ink into two saucers and filled them from edge to edge with shiny black.\n\nThe black ovals that had been his eyes were lifting themselves out of his eye sockets, showing little legs, and in the space of a few seconds there was a fat black beetle emerging from each socket. They crawled down the man’s face like tears.\n\nJamie screamed, the sound shuddering into a moan, and there was movement in the corner of Nick’s eye that suggested he and Mae were clinging to each other. At Nick’s side he could feel Alan trembling. Nick was distantly aware that he should be shocked himself, but he’d seen a lot of things in his life worse than this. He kept watching with calm interest, and the man’s face sharpened as if he was a dog who had caught a scent. There was a long moment where Nick was sure that somehow the man could see him.\n\nThe man winked, his wrinkled eyelid flicking over the raw hollow of his eye socket. Nick hesitated for a second, and then winked back.\n\nOne of the fat black beetles reached the man’s chin and dropped into the kneeling woman’s hair. She looked up and shook the beetle onto the floor with a convulsive tremor, but aside from that initial movement of automatic disgust, she did not seem surprised. She looked to be in her mid-twenties, with thick chestnut hair and brimming eyes. Nick wondered what had made her scream.\n\n“I see you’ve met Ruth and Thomas,” said Merris Cromwell, her voice ringing clear and calm against the corridor walls. She spoke as if she was introducing people at a cocktail party.\n\n“Met Ruth and—? What the hell is wrong with that man?” Jamie demanded, his voice unusually ferocious. He strode toward Merris, and Nick noticed that his shoulders were shaking. He imagined from the way Jamie was behaving that he already knew what was wrong with the man and was doing his best not to believe what he knew.\n\nMerris walked down the corridor as if she could not see Jamie, and at the last moment before a collision was inevitable Jamie stepped aside. “Let me see,” she said. “Mute, with no trace of his former personality remaining, and with the ability to manipulate anything in the natural world, including his own body. I shall take a wild leap and say that he’s possessed.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nTrĩ nội, trĩ ngoại 20 năm cũng phải teo với cách này\nSuckhoevungcao\nCơn bão về chiếc đống hồ Omega bản sao, chỉ bán duy nhất 1 ngày\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

She obviously saw something in one of their faces that irritated her, because her lip curled and she demanded in her turn, “Have none of you ever given a moment’s thought to what happens to the possessed?”\n\nNone of them had an answer for her. Merris waited for a moment so they could all be fully aware of that and went on.\n\n“A mute, magically powerful creature replaces an ordinary person overnight. You can’t imagine that passes unnoticed. If the possessed has a family, they soon notice the change. They’re horrified, and they have nobody to help them. Except us.”\n\nShe smiled. “We have these new magical circles specifically designed to confine a demon who has acquired a human body. We have containment facilities. If people come to us with tales of possessed friends and relatives, we do not talk about mental illness and we do not disbelieve in the demon’s power. Mezentius House is the only place these desperate people can turn, and of course, we obey the businesslike laws of supply and demand. They pay well for our help.”\n\n“They’re people in trouble!” Jamie cried, wiping his mouth as if he’d eaten something bad and could not rub away the taste.\n\nNick thought suddenly of what that magician Gerald had said, that the Market was funded with blood money. This was why everyone obeyed Merris Cromwell. This money was what helped the Market people — helped them — find houses and transfer to new schools and jobs quickly.\n\nThe money was paid by the families of people who’d been possessed, like Jamie might be. Like Alan might be. He wondered what Sin would think of this.\n\nMerris raised her eyebrows. “So are the people who go to hospitals, and they have to pay. There are a lot of hospitals. There is only one Mezentius House.”\n\nThoughts of Alan aside, it did not sound unreasonable to Nick. Those who dealt in magic had their own private economy, and Merris had worked out how to manipulate it in her favor. There was just one thing he didn’t understand.\n\nHe cleared his throat. “Why don’t you kill them all?”\n\n“The relatives seem curiously reluctant to have the possessed killed. Particularly once I explain to them that their loved one is inside somewhere, unable to regain control of their body. Their friends and family want them controlled but not harmed. They pray for miracles. Sometimes they insist on staying with them, hoping to ease their pain.” Merris shrugged. “That costs extra.”\n\n“The magical circles you keep the possessed in,” Alan said with what appeared to be scientific interest. “How different are they from normal magicians’ circles? Can you command a demon in them? Could you summon one?”\n\n“I cannot imagine why we would want to. We have quite enough to do with the demons we have. I consider keeping them confined the most important part,” said Merris dryly. “Since you came all this way to insist on answers, I have a few diagrams I can show you that detail how our circles work.”\n\n“I’d appreciate that,” said Alan.\n\n“They’re very basic,” Merris said. “You can’t summon a demon into them. We haven’t even worked out a way to make communication lines work for them. Almost the only thing we can do is keep them trapped.”\n\n“What if a dancer was involved?” Alan asked, frowning. “Speaking purely academically, of course.”\n\nNick wondered if Alan had some sort of plan for trapping the demons the magicians sent after them. It didn’t sound like it would work.\n\nMae and Jamie were still staring into the cell with horrified fascination, and after a moment, Mae spoke.\n\n“Does a miracle ever happen? I mean, if you have them trapped — does the demon ever leave?”\n\n“No demon ever leaves,” Merris said. “No matter what happens to them, they prefer our world to theirs. But people keep hoping, right until the end.”\n\nShe nodded casually to the window in the metal door. They all watched, as if the window was a television and the scene had been designed for them to see, while chestnut-haired Ruth climbed stiffly to her feet. She put her hand to Thomas’s face, and Thomas — did not blink, exactly. His eyes flickered as if he had multiple eyelids, like a cat, and when his eyes were open they were normal eyes again. He watched the woman with his flat gaze and under his eyes a cut opened on her cheek. She moaned and held her hand to her face, and he looked at her arm. Another gash opened there, as if his traveling eyes were knives.\n\n“Don’t worry,” Merris told them. “The demon’s using all the magic he can think of to make her let him out, but he won’t damage her permanently. He knows she’s the only one who will feed him.”\n\nMoving like an old woman, Ruth replaced her hand against the possessed Thomas’s face. She stroked his cheek briefly, and Nick saw her lips move, though he could not make out what she was saying. It had never occurred to Nick before that communication lines could not be drawn for a demon possessing a human. He’d known that possessed people did not speak. Now, watching the possessed body watch the woman with reptilian blankness, he realized that the demon really could not understand.\n\nThe woman kept talking, even though it was pointless. Nick thought he made out the word ‘love’ when she spoke, but he could have been wrong.\n\nMae said, trying and failing to repress a tremor in her voice, “Is she his daughter?”\n\n“Oh no, my dear,” Merris said absently. “The man’s young. His body’s tearing itself apart trying to fight the demon; he didn’t look like this a week ago. She’s his wife.”\n\nThe demon who looked like Thomas smiled at his wife, and then his tongue darted out and caught the other beetle that had once been his eye. It made a soft, sickening sound between his teeth. The woman gagged, and he kept grinning.\n\n“He’s just trying to scare her,” said Merris, her voice still clinical and uninterested. “A demon will try to manipulate a human any way it can. Don’t worry. She knows better than to be fooled.”\n\nRuth put a hand to her own mouth and started to cry.\n\nNick rather expected Jamie to turn and bolt, but it was Alan who did so.\n\nOne moment he was by Nick’s side, still and quiet as he was when he was upset and turning in on himself, but in control. The next he was limping as fast as he could down the corridor, back in the direction they had come, away from the metal doors hiding the demons.\n\nNick should have looked at Alan; he should have made sure he wasn’t upset. Alan could usually handle himself, but this was different. Alan was carrying a second-tier mark. Alan was thinking of his future.\n\nNick considered waiting for Mae to offer to go after him. That would please Alan, he thought, but Mae did not offer. Nick glanced at her and saw her standing close by Jamie, feet planted apart as if she was going to wrestle someone, looking furiously concerned. She did not want to leave her brother.\n\nThat was fine by Nick. He didn’t want to leave his brother either.\n\n“Don’t come after us,” he said curtly, and spun around and after Alan.\n\nMae would probably be better at comforting Alan than he would. Jamie would probably be better at it. Nick did not have the slightest idea what to do, but Alan was his brother and no one else’s, and he would think of something.\n\nHe found Alan in a bathroom, stooped over the sink and looking like he was going to be sick. The water was running, and Alan was splashing his face frantically. He looked up and saw Nick at the mirror. Nick looked at his own stone-faced reflection and Alan’s almost frightened eyes.\n\n“Alan,” he said, his voice rough.\n\nAlan closed his eyes. “What?”\n\nNick advanced cautiously, wishing this was as simple as creeping up on someone to kill them. “You okay?”\n\nHe wondered if other people ever realized how stupid half the things they said were. Alan was shaking and scared and obviously not okay, but Nick had to ask because that was what you asked, and no matter how stupid the usual words sounded, Nick had no words of his own to offer.\n\n“I might be okay,” said Alan, who told lies.\n\nHe looked down again, into the basin of the sink and away from their reflections. There were dark circles under Alan’s eyes, Nick saw in the cold, uncompromising picture the mirror gave him, and deep lines around his mouth. He was so much paler than he had been even a week ago. It made Nick think of the demon they’d left behind, in a body that had looked young last week.\n\n“Don’t,” he said, and cleared his throat. “You don’t need to worry.” He had to drag every word out. “It won’t happen to you. I won’t let it.”\n\n“That’s not why,” Alan said, but his shoulders relaxed.\n\nThis encouraged Nick to go over to him, but once he was there he could only hang uselessly over his brother. Alan was the one who was good at this stuff, who was always hair ruffling or shoulder patting. Gestures like that did not come naturally to Nick, any more than comforting words did.\n\n“Sure it’s not,” Nick said, trying hard to make his voice gentle. It cracked and came out sounding harsh.\n\nHe sat on the floor with his back against the wall, and after a moment Alan gave a sigh that was either tired or resigned. Nick kept his head bowed as Alan’s hand settled on his neck, palm gun-callused, and rested there.\n\nNick had never seen the point of just touching people, but if this made Alan feel better, he supposed it wasn’t so bad.\n\n“Why did we come here?” he asked.\n\n“I wanted to see the possessed patients,” Alan answered, his voice low. “But I didn’t want you to see them. I didn’t want any of you to see.”\n\n“It’s all right,” Nick said, trying to be comforting. “They didn’t bother me.”\n\nHe glanced up at Alan, and Alan did not look comforted. He looked as if he was exhausted and in pain.\n\nNick felt a sharp pang of frustration, like when he’d been younger and teachers had asked him to read aloud or girls had expected some sort of gesture from him, but a thousand times worse because this was his brother and it mattered.\n\n“I’ll protect you,” he said at last, awkwardly. He felt stupid saying it; Alan already knew that he would.\n\nAlan looked a little steadier, all the same. “I’m counting on it.”\n\n“Good,” said Nick. “You’ll be okay. I’ll protect you. Don’t — don’t be upset anymore.”\n\nAlan made a soft sound, trembling between a breath and a laugh. “I’m not upset.”\n\n“You liar,” Nick mumbled.\n\nAlan stroked his hair just once, and then drew his hand away. “I’m okay now,” he said. “Really.”\n\nIt sounded true, sounded like something Nick could believe. He remembered feeling peaceful on the boat, just trusting Alan, and it seemed like something he could do again.\n\nNick’s phone rang. He cursed and half rose in order to fish it out of his jeans, and then looked blankly at the number that appeared on the screen.\n\n“Who the…?” He shrugged and made to cut them off.\n\n“Probably one of your many admirers,” Alan said. “Go ahead, answer it. I’m all right, I promise. I’ll be out in a minute.”\n\nNick had been busy lately. He didn’t remember giving his number out to any girls, but if Alan wanted a moment, he should have it. Nick scrambled to his feet, lingered for an instant wondering if he should say anything, and ended up just nodding at his brother. Alan smiled at Nick as he went out the door, and he answered the phone in a good mood. Whoever the girl was, he’d pretend to remember her.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCư dân mạng phát sốt với bản sao đồng hồ Omega giảm 90% chi 1 hôm\nWatchthuysichinhhang\nBúi trĩ đeo bám dai dẳng!

Who’s this?”\n\nNick spoke automatically, so she wouldn’t go away before he had a chance to think.\n\n“My name is Natasha Walsh,” the woman said. “Marie was my sister.”\n\n“She’s dead?” Nick rapped out.\n\nHe felt nothing but satisfaction at the thought. She was dead then, that smiling blond girl, and if she was dead she could not lay claim to his brother. He had what he wanted. He almost hung up on her then.\n\nThe woman spoke an instant before he did. “Look,” she said, and then her words tumbled out, so fast they all rolled together. “Is this about Alan? Is he all right? I haven’t seen him since last Christmas.”\n\nThe way she talked about Alan sounded personal. Nobody whom Nick had never heard of before in his life should be able to talk about his brother like that.\n\n“Last Christmas,” Nick repeated.\n\nSo Nick’s half suspicion had been true: Alan had gone away and left them for that dead girl. He’d lied about having to do a translation; he’d left Nick in a cold, dark house that felt abandoned, with Mum rocking upstairs. Nick wanted to know why he’d done it. He wanted to know exactly what this girl had been to Alan.\n\nHe put a hand to the back of his neck, his own grip stronger and rougher than Alan’s, and thought about trusting his brother.\n\n“Look,” he said abruptly. “This isn’t a good time. Can I—I’ll call you back.”\n\nHe turned the phone off before she could speak again. Then he weighed it, small and stupid-looking in his big hand. He didn’t know why he even had a phone, he thought; he never wanted to call anybody.\n\nHe did know why, of course. Alan had given him the phone, and he’d kept it because he knew it made Alan feel better to know that he could get in touch with Nick whenever he wanted and check that he was safe.\n\nNick slid the phone into his pocket and came to a decision. He’d go to Alan and tell him everything. Nick had been hiding things too, but he’d tell Alan that he knew about Marie and what he’d done to find out more. Alan would understand that the secrets and lies had to stop.\n\nHe wasn’t in the bathroom where Nick had left him. Nick frowned and began to retrace their steps, going slowly back toward where they’d left Mae and Jamie. He was only halfway down the corridor when he was caught and held by the sound of his brother’s voice behind a door.\n\n“I knew he’d be sick,” Alan said. “That didn’t matter.”\n\nNick had been about to open the door, and now he found himself staring at it instead.\n\n“It seems a lot of things haven’t mattered to you,” said the voice of Merris Cromwell.\n\nThere was a small pause, and Alan replied, “I don’t regret anything I’ve done.”\n\nAlan had been set on coming here, and Nick had been set on following him. He would have done it no matter what, but the thought that Alan had cold-bloodedly accepted that Nick would be ill made him feel an uneasy shift in his stomach, as if he was still sick. He couldn’t connect the image of his brother Alan — who’d raised him, packed his school lunches, and used to sit on the edge of Nick’s bed like a small, ferociously patient owl, waiting for him to fall asleep — with the dispassionate voice behind the door.\n\n“You may not regret it, but the Market will resent it,” Merris Cromwell said, her voice low and cold. “If we had known, we would never have let you come among us. You’ll never be welcome there again.”\n\nAlan had told Merris about Mum. Nick should have felt something about that, but he didn’t. He felt nothing. He stood in the cold, echoing corridor unable to make sense of anything.\n\n“Do you think I care?” Alan demanded. “Can you help me or not?”\n\n“I can’t help you, and I’m glad I can’t,” Merris said icily. “Don’t look to the Market for help from now on. Everyone’s hand will be turned against you. You’re on your own.”\n\nNick heard Alan make a sound he recognized, a soft, shaky breath; hurt but pulling himself together. “I thought I would be. I know what I have to do, then. Thank you.”\n\n“Don’t thank me,” Merris said. “Don’t do this.” There was a real note of pain in her voice suddenly, as if she’d thought she knew Alan, as if she’d believed in Alan like Nick had. “Take my advice, Alan. Nobody ever needs to know about this. Hand it over to the magicians. Walk away.”\n\nIt was good advice, Market advice. Nobody from the Market would have shielded a magician, or been suicidal enough to openly defy a Circle. Nick wished Alan would take it. If he’d just give up on Mum and give away the charm, Mum would die — but she’d been a magician, and she deserved to die. With the threat of a whole Circle after them lifted, he could protect Alan. They could get that mark off.\n\nBut apparently he didn’t know Alan any more than Merris did.\n\n“Take my advice, Merris,” Alan said in a voice twice as cold as hers. “Don’t ever suggest anything like that to me again.”\n\nMerris’ voice was a low hiss. “Get out of my house.”\n\n“No,” said Alan. “First I want you to arrange somewhere else for us to live.”\n\n“And why should I do that?”\n\n“Because I still have contacts in the Market,” Alan told her. “You may spread your stories about me, and some will believe you, but I’m the sweet, studious boy that everybody likes. You’re the mystery. Nobody knows where you get your money from, and I don’t think many people will approve of you leeching money from the helpless victims of magicians and using it to gain power in our Market. Because that’s the way I’ll spin it, Merris. And people will believe me. I can make people trust me; you should know that. Even you did.”\n\n“Believe me, I’m regretting it now.” Merris’s voice snapped into her usual tones, cool and bargaining. “A house is the price of your silence? So be it. You and yours will be out of my home by morning. And you’d better keep your part of the bargain, or I’ll have you killed.”\n\n“Done,” said Alan, in the exact same tone. Then his voice softened. “I’m sorry I have to do this.”\n\nThere was no hint of yielding in Merris’s voice. “You don’t have to do this. You should give it up.”\n\n“I’m sorry,” Alan said, his voice kind but firm, “but I’ve already done this and I’ll do a lot worse. I will not give up. And if you can’t help me, Merris, then get the hell out of my way.”\n\nUnder any other circumstances, Nick would have found it funny: his brother blackmailing Merris of the Market and not turning a hair. He would’ve approved. Only now it was more proof of what Mum meant to Alan.\n\nMum and Marie, the girl in the picture. Alan wouldn’t tell him his plans for saving Mum, and he hadn’t even told him that Marie existed. Alan wouldn’t tell him anything, but that didn’t matter. Nick could find out the truth on his own.\n\nHe walked away from the door, back toward Mae and Jamie, and as he did so he took out his phone and rang the last listed call.\n\nThe same woman’s voice answered, breathless and anxious. “Hello?”\n\n“Can I come and see you?” he asked abruptly. “I know where Alan is. I’ll tell you all about him. Give me your address.”\n\nAlan’s blackmail must have been very successful indeed, since Merris not only found them a new home in London but provided them with her own boat back and gave Nick herbs to make him sleep through the voyage.\n\n“Such concern for me,” Nick said on the dock. His voice was meant to be bitter, but it simply sounded cold. “I’m touched.”\n\nThe others were standing in a little knot, trying to keep warm by staying close. It was not yet dawn, and the sea air hit Nick’s face like a series of slaps with icy hands.\n\nAlan was holding Mum’s hand. She still looked groggy from whatever Merris had given her, and she stood leaning against Alan, the billowing black veil of her hair caught by the wind, flying and settling over them both. Alan was watching Nick, his face to all appearances honestly puzzled and hurt.\n\nNick was standing as far away from the others as he could without actually standing in the sea.\n\n“There’s a bedroom you can sleep in,” Alan offered, his voice tentative. “I’ll sit with you in case you need help.”\n\n“I don’t need your help,” said Nick curtly. He looked away from Alan and Mum, and his eyes settled on another face.\n\nThe sight and smell of the sea was already making him feel a little ill, that and the dread of being completely and humiliatingly helpless again curdling in his stomach. The sound of the wind was like the freezing shout of a hundred angry ghosts. Looking at his family only made him feel worse.\n\nLooking at Mae made him feel a little steadier. She had her face tipped up to study his, determined dark eyes and a stubborn mouth. The way she looked was familiar to him by now, and the better he knew her, the better she looked. He smiled at her, a slow, deliberate smile that made an answering smile curve her lips.\n\n“I’d rather have Mae nurse me,” he drawled.\n\nEven if he hadn’t been able to see her, he would have heard the smile in her voice. “Yeah, all right.”\n\nThat was when Merris’s skipper, Philip, a man with the close-clipped hair and charcoal-colored suit of a businessman and the worn teeth and yellow tongue of a necromancer, gestured them aboard. The herbs Merris had given Nick were already making him feel a little dizzy, but that was almost a relief; his dread of coming aboard and his fury at Alan both felt distant, wrapped up safe until he could deal with them.\n\nSoon he would be back on land and he would know all Alan’s secrets. For now he could only stagger down the steps to reach the bedroom below deck, his hand fumbling at the doorknob. The room was circular at one end, the bed white and plain with cuffs at each corner.\n\nSo this was how they transported the possessed. Nick went and lay back on the bed, thankful that he did not have to keep his feet any longer. He stared up at the wooden ceiling and heard Mae come in and shut the door.\n\n“You don’t need to use the restraints,” Nick told the ceiling. “I’ll be good.”\n\nMae laughed. “But I was planning to do terrible things to you once I had you at my mercy.”\n\n“Oh,” said Nick. “In that case, go right ahead.”\n\n“No, you’ve spoiled the moment now.”\n\n“Yeah,” Nick muttered. “I do that a lot.”\n\nSo many girls had started off looking at him all shiny-eyed and breathless, and then they’d all been disillusioned. Most had ended up scared. Mae had already been around longer than any of those girls, and she didn’t scare easily, but of course it wasn’t like that between them.\n\n“Nick,” Mae said, and hesitated.\n\nIt was rare enough for her to hesitate that Nick was intrigued. He levered himself up on his elbows and looked at her. She had her back up against the door, her pink hair mussed by the wind and her cheeks flushed. Which could have been another effect of the wind.\n\n“I was wondering,” Mae continued. “That girl at the Market. Sin. Are you going out with her?”\n\n“No,” said Nick. He didn’t really have much else to say, but Mae was staring at the floor and looking embarrassed, so he went on. “I’ve never really gone out with anyone.”\n\nIt had never particularly bothered him either. A night or two with a girl, and then having her go away and the next one come along: it had always seemed like an all-right way to do things.\n\nNick was surprised that she’d asked; not by the directness of it, because that was her style, but he was surprised that she’d wanted to know.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nCư dân mạng phát sốt với bản sao đồng hồ Omega giảm 90% chi 1 hôm\nWatchthuysichinhhang\nBúi trĩ đeo bám dai dẳng!

Tắc nghẽn mạch máu dẫn đến bệnh tim khó lường!\nCardiohelptips\n\nSince she had, it must mean — he was pretty sure that it did mean — that she preferred Nick. And if she really did…\n\nMae’s eyebrows had come up. She was smiling a bit.\n\n“Oh really,” she said, her voice amused and incredulous. “A complete innocent, are you?”\n\n“Definitely,” Nick assured her, letting his voice slide low. “You can try corrupting me if you like.”\n\nMae dimpled. “It’s no fun if you’re asking for it.”\n\n“No, no,” Nick drawled. “Release me, you monster. Your wicked ways shock me to my soul. And yet I find you strangely attractive.”\n\nThe boat purred into life, lurching away from the dock and swaying between one wave and the next. Nick shut his eyes in a brief flash of nausea.\n\n“I feel I should warn you,” he said after a moment. “I may be about to get sick or pass out.”\n\n“Uh,” said Mae. “Sexy.”\n\nFunnily enough, it was this exciting news that peeled her off the door Nick had been starting to think she was glued to. She came to stand by the bed, pulling her iPod out of her pocket and fiddling with it, unwinding the earphones coiled around it.\n\n“Maybe what you need is a distraction,” she began.\n\nOn impulse Nick reached up and pulled her down to the bed. Mae made a startled sound, half breath and half laugh, and he rolled her over and under him easily, using his strength the way girls sometimes liked him to.\n\nHe looked down at her, then leaned in close, feeling her shiver at his breath on her ear, and murmured, “Maybe.”\n\nThe morning sunlight was turning the cotton sheets into hot gold; he saw the flash in her eyes under suddenly heavy eyelids and smiled down at her. He was braced over her, his arms supporting his weight, and a sway of the ship and a breath lifted her h*ps against his. Her breath turned into a shiver, traveling slowly along the length of her body, and she lifted her hands and ran her palms along the tense swell of his arms.\n\nHe probably shouldn’t be doing this. Alan liked her, and he might be angry with Alan now but he wouldn’t be angry forever. Alan was his brother, and he shouldn’t be doing this, but Alan had let him get sick and Mae preferred him.\n\nIt was all warm, white and gold and that absurd pink, the curves of her and the rumpled lines of the sheets, all blending and blurring together because he was starting to slip out of consciousness.\n\nMae pushed him gently backward onto the pillows, and he went, throwing an arm over his eyes.\n\n“I’d hate for you to get the wrong idea about me,” he said. “Under normal circumstances, I swear, I would have copped a feel.”\n\n“I was about to suggest that some music might be in order anyway,” said Mae, valiantly pretending that she was not out of breath, her voice warm and trembling as she had been under him a moment ago.\n\nShe put one of the iPod earpieces in his ear, and the other presumably in her own, and settled back down on the pillows. The boat rocked them gently back and forth in a way that Nick might have found soothing if he hadn’t felt so ill, and he fought to stay awake as he heard music that sounded in a faint faraway fashion like the drums of the Goblin Market.\n\n“That’s kind of nice.”\n\n“Maybe we can go listen to them sometime,” Mae murmured.\n\n“Maybe,” said Nick.\n\nMae was a warm weight that tilted him slightly to her side of the bed, possibly less because of her weight than because that was where he wanted to be. The sunlight painted dusty gold streaks against the blackness before Nick’s closed eyes, and the drums beat in a rhythm with his heart. Mae had one foot tucked under his leg, and as he finally lost consciousness he felt her hand lightly pushing back a strand of his hair. It was pointless, but like the music, it was kind of nice.\n\nThe last thing he wondered was whether this counted as her asking him out.\n\n11\n\nAnswers\n\nTHE STREET IN DURHAM WHERE MARIE’S SISTER LIVED felt familiar to Nick. He was aware that he’d never been to Durham before. He didn’t recognize the city, but as he pulled his battered car in line with the shining clean vehicles at the pavement edge, it occurred to him that he knew the street.\n\nIt reminded him of Mae and Jamie’s house, of the houses belonging to school friends or girlfriends whose names Nick did not now recall. There were neatly tended gardens, fresh paint on the doors, and a general sense of well-being about the whole area. Here, suggested the blooming flowerbeds, people were comfortable, families were secure, and above all, children were sheltered.\n\nNick knew it was an illusion. These people hurt each other as much as all families did, and if magic ever invaded their lives, they would be helpless.\n\nMaybe it was an illusion Alan wanted, though. This place was certainly a contrast to the shabby house Merris had found for them yesterday, close to their old house so they could hunt any magicians whom Gerald might direct there. It was squeezed between a Chinese takeaway, bearing a broken sign with letters that sizzled and flickered, and a derelict house, its boarded windows staring and blank as dead eyes.\n\nAlan must have wanted more than the girl. He must have wanted a home like this. Nick looked at the house in the same way that he would have sized up an enemy. Then, instead of attacking, he went up to that brightly painted door and leaned heavily on the bell.\n\nIf it had not been for her anxious eyes, Nick would not have thought this was the right woman. Natasha Walsh was blond, thin in an attenuated way, and much older than he had expected her to be.\n\n“Are you — who are you?” she asked.\n\nNick said curtly, “Nicholas Ryves,” and was amazed to see this slim, pastel-cardiganed housewife blossom into a tentative welcome.\n\n“Oh, you’re one of Daniel’s family! Do come in. Please.”\n\nNick stepped into a hall, carpeted brown with great pink flowers, and wondered what Alan had told this woman about Dad.\n\n“So you — you said you knew something about Alan,” the stranger said, twisting her hands together.\n\n“You said you saw him last Christmas.”\n\nShe pushed open a door and led him into a little sitting room, with cream silk fittings and picture frames glinting brightly on every surface. Nick hovered in the middle of the room, feeling like a clumsy animal who should not be allowed in here, and who would break something in a moment.\n\n“Yes,” she answered. “He spent Christmas here with us. It was so lovely — we were so happy to have him. He played with the kids. They loved him.” She tilted up her chin, almost defiantly, as if to face pain. “We all loved him, and then he stopped answering my letters.”\n\nHe did not stop answering your letters, Nick thought. I threw them away. He thought you had stopped caring.\n\nAlan had come away to this place. He’d left him. He’d wanted to leave him.\n\nNick didn’t even know how to feel about this. It was like the fact that Alan had made him sick. His mind kept shying violently away from the idea and the unfocused pain it promised. It was better to be angry. He hated this woman, hated this whole family. They were weak and stupid and they couldn’t have his brother and that was all there was to it. He didn’t need to feel anything else.\n\nHe felt a treacherous twinge at the thought of Alan with kids. Alan loved kids. He’d pick them up and a soft, wondering expression would come over his face. No wonder Marie had been such a temptation, with a home like this.\n\nNatasha turned a beseeching face to his. “Do you know Alan?”\n\n“Yeah,” Nick said curtly. “He’s my brother.”\n\nShe stared at him for a long moment and then said, quite simply, as if anybody should know it was the truth, “Alan doesn’t have a brother.”\n\nThe little room felt suddenly cold, frozen in its horrible cream and silver, like a wedding cake left in the freezer. Nick found his voice, and it sounded a long way away.\n\n“He may not have mentioned me,” he answered, putting a stone wall of denial between himself and the possibility that Alan had lied about him, had wished him out of existence, “but I’ve been his brother all my life.”\n\n“Do you mean you’re his stepbrother?” Natasha Walsh offered, looking perplexed.\n\nPeople doubting his relationship to Alan was nothing new, but on top of everything else it seemed like an insult he could not bear.\n\n“No, his real brother,” Nick growled.\n\nShe frowned, her expression reminding him of a dozen mothers who’d looked as if they wanted to call the police on him for daring to touch their daughters.\n\n“If this is some kind of joke—”\n\n“I’m not laughing. I’m his brother.”\n\n“You can’t possibly be his brother,” Mrs. Walsh snapped. “My sister Marie only had one child. I think I should know.”\n\nNick stared at her silently, unable to find words. He could only see images, running together in his mind like a slide show. Of Alan’s face. Of the face of that smiling girl in the picture, and the mad, cold face of the woman he’d always thought — he’d always known — was their mother.\n\nSomething about his own face made the woman stop frowning and pick up a picture to display to Nick. It was one of the photographs in silver frames. It showed Dad, big and smiling and wearing a ridiculous mustache, standing next to Marie, who was small, smiling, and wearing a wedding dress. They were holding hands, and Nick, who was used to jealously scanning people for signs of a family resemblance, was held by the sight.\n\nDad’s hands were big, the knuckles large and square, the backs dusted with hair. The girl Marie had hands that were smaller, more feminine, but unmistakably Alan’s thin sensitive hands.\n\nIt was an enormous relief.\n\nNo wonder she’d been wearing old-fashioned clothes in the hidden picture. No wonder Alan had lied. He would not have wanted Nick to know they had different mothers. He would have been afraid Nick would be hurt. He’d been looking out for Nick.\n\nNick didn’t like it, but he understood. Alan had always called Mum Olivia. It made sense that Alan had nothing to do with her really, that he was not tainted by her madness in the least.\n\n“You know who you do look like,” Mrs. Walsh said suddenly. “You look like Olivia. Daniel’s first wife. She—” The woman hesitated. “I think they married very young. They were childhood sweethearts and — I didn’t know her very well, but she always seemed restless. She ran away with someone else, and after a few years, Daniel and Marie got married. Is — is something wrong?”\n\n“Nothing’s wrong,” he snarled. “Everything’s fine.”\n\nNick looked at the picture in Mrs. Walsh’s hands and thought of the wedding picture Alan kept by his bedside. Mum and Dad looked so young in that picture, he remembered. They looked younger than Dad in this picture.\n\nFurious panic fragmented the images in Nick’s head for a moment. He tried to piece together all this new information until it made sense. It felt like fitting the shards of a broken glass together with his bare hands, but he didn’t care if it hurt as long as he could force the world into a pattern he could understand.\n\nSo Mum and Dad had been married and separated. That didn’t mean anything. Mum had come back to Dad, then, and he’d taken her in because he’d loved her once. That explained why he’d protected a magician. That made sense. It did not mean that anything in Nick’s life had changed.\n\n“She came back,” he said, trying to sound calm. “Olivia. She and Dad had me—”\n\n“Marie died fifteen years ago,” Mrs. Walsh blurted out. “I was with her. I was with Alan and Daniel the whole time. You must be about seventeen! I don’t know who you are, but I know you’re not Daniel Ryves’s son.”\n\nShe looked upset and suspicious at once as she threw the words in his face, but Nick abruptly ceased to care. She’d told him everything she knew now. She didn’t matter anymore. Dad used to keep a lot of pictures, but he’d never seen a picture of Alan when he was younger than four, or of himself when he was younger than one. Mum had returned to Dad — to Daniel Ryves — traumatized, scared, carrying an amulet and a baby.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nViêm họng mãn tính 4 năm uống thuốc mãi không khỏi phải làm sao?\nArgelomag\nCư dân mạng phát sốt với bản sao đồng hồ Omega giảm 90% 1 ngày\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

I didn’t see my nephew for fourteen years and he came back crippled and saying that his father was dead, and then he vanished. I just want to know if he’s all right.”\n\nShe looked as if she was going to cry. Alan would have cared.\n\nNick stared at this woman, Alan’s aunt, and realized that this stranger had a better claim on Alan than he did.\n\nThe small sitting room and its decorations did not seem frozen anymore. Nick wanted to smash it all. He’d been cold before, but now his blood felt too hot. He was burning up, he was shaking with rage.\n\nThe horrible woman’s voice changed. “Are you all right?” she asked. “Do you — do you need to sit down? Would you like a glass of water?”\n\nNatasha Walsh moved forward, and Nick grabbed hold of her upper arm. She recoiled from the look on his face.\n\nHe’d always known that he scared people sometimes. Clearly it was a talent he’d inherited from his father.\n\nThe woman was suddenly breathing hard, in small gasps weighted by fear. “Don’t hurt me.”\n\nHe hated her. She’d told him that everything he’d ever known about his life was a lie, and he hated her almost as much as he hated that liar Alan. Alan, who belonged in this place, with this woman and her family, and not with him.\n\nNick put his lips to her ear and whispered, “Why not?”\n\nHe shook her hard, and she gave a thin, small scream and tried to break away. She didn’t have a chance.\n\n“Let me go,” she pleaded.\n\n“Why?” Nick demanded, his voice rising to a shout. “I don’t feel sorry for you. I don’t feel anything for you. Why should I?”\n\nHe shook her again, her shoulders impossibly thin and frail in the grip of his hands. She stared up at him with terrified eyes that were washed-out copies of Alan’s deep-blue eyes and for a moment he couldn’t bear it; he didn’t know what he was going to do.\n\nThen the picture slipped out of her shaking fingers and clattered onto the rug.\n\nNick looked down and saw Dad staring up at him.\n\nHe let the woman go and bolted out of that warm, comfortable home into the rain.\n\nHe had not heard when it started raining, but now the drops pounded against his skin and rattled the roof of the car. He stood with his arms braced against the roof, the rain pulling a slick black curtain of hair over his eyes, and wondered why he didn’t just get into the car and drive. It occurred to him that he was not sure where to go. Home had always been an uncertain concept, attached to no particular place and centered on someone who he now knew did not belong to him.\n\nThere was no home to go back to. He pressed his forehead against his wet forearms, against the slippery metal of the car roof, and tried to think. It could not be true, not really. There would be no way to live if it was true.\n\nHe drove back to London eventually, because he could not stay outside that house and he could not think of anything else to do. He was not panicked or running for a bolt-hole like a wounded animal. He felt strangely empty of feelings or ideas, as if someone had slit him open and removed them. He just kept driving.\n\nAlan called this kind of rain cats’ paws, and this rain seemed to mark the passing of a nightmarish army of cats. Nick could barely see to drive, and the gray of a pouring sky seemed not to change but to bleed into the gray of a city. He only really noticed that he was in London when the car coughed to a stop on Tower Bridge, and he realized that night had been closing in behind the rain.\n\nNick got out and went to the front of the car, intending to check out the engine, but the rain hammered all thought from his mind. He stood staring at the car bonnet, the rain distorting the road and the passing cars into a river of ink, the flow broken occasionally by flashes of metal.\n\nHe turned away and left the car amidst the indignant honking of other motorists. He started walking through the rain. Within minutes he felt numb with cold, the relentless lashing of rain against his skin becoming as personal a rhythm as his footsteps.\n\nThe towers on the bridge loomed like enemy fortresses against a sky gone slate gray with rain clouds and the approach of night. Nick stared up at them and then at the London skyline, the buildings spiky and glittering as stiletto knives. He bowed his head and walked through the driving rain.\n\nHe had to walk for a long time to get home. The sky had turned dull, dead black, and his legs had the heavy feeling that meant every muscle would be aching tomorrow. The rain had not stopped falling. As he approached the flickering sign of the Chinese takeaway, the light turned the raindrops silver, and Nick had forgotten what it felt like to be dry.\n\nHe came into the house and leaned against the door. The rain drummed outside, and he wondered if he should just go back out and keep walking. He’d known what to do when he was walking.\n\n“Nick!”\n\nHe looked up, more because of the light being switched on than at the sound of his name. At the top of the stairs stood Mae, limned by the pale yellow light of a na**d bulb.\n\n“Where have you been?” she asked. “It’s three in the morning. Alan’s going crazy with worry.”\n\nHe flinched at the name like a kicked dog and hated himself for doing it. Mae’s face changed from inquiry to suspicion.\n\n“Nick,” she said. “What’s going on?”\n\nHe wanted to snarl at her that it was none of her business; he wanted her to shut up and get out of his way. He wanted to tell her that he’d never liked her. When he’d thought that he liked her, he’d been wrong.\n\nHe couldn’t seem to find any words, just a hollow feeling where words should have been. He opened his mouth and an odd sound came out, like a croaking bird, and he stared up at her blankly.\n\nMae came running down the stairs, and he moved forward. He wanted to tell her to stop, not to ask him any more questions, but he did not want to open his mouth and find nothing there again.\n\n“You’re soaking wet,” Mae said. She spoke kindly, and Nick wished she would stop. It reminded him of Alan.\n\nShe touched his shoulder, pinching the material of his shirt between two fingers and peeling the drenched material away from his skin. Nick knew he was drenched; he didn’t need her to prove it to him, but it was only when she touched him that a look of real alarm flashed over her face. He stood dumb, wondering why, and she pressed her hand flat against his shoulder.\n\nAgainst her steady hand, he realized he was shaking.\n\n“I’ll get—” Mae began, and Nick stopped her.\n\nIt was easy to catch her and hold her trapped against the banister. She was small and he was strong, and he pinned her with one hand.\n\nHer breath started coming a little faster and he could see a pulse at her throat jumping even in the low light, but she did not struggle. She stayed perfectly still and raked her eyes carefully over Nick’s face. He could practically see her mind ticking over the possibilities, trying to form a plan, trying to guess what Nick would do next.\n\nHe kissed her.\n\nHe moved in and pressed her hard against the banister, holding her soft and small and trapped against him. He kept her face tilted up, her chin cupped in his palm and his fingers against her jaw. His arm around her waist was tense, unyielding as an iron bar.\n\nShe could not get away, and she did not try. After a moment her arm slid around his neck, and she kissed him back.\n\nNick was only aware of how miserably cold he had been when he felt the chill, settled into dull pain in his bones, finally ease. He grabbed the dry, warm material of her T-shirt in his fists, pushed it up until he felt the smooth, warm skin of her back under his hands. Mae curved her mouth against his and against his shut eyes the swinging lightbulb became the dancing lanterns of the Goblin Market, and he thought with savage satisfaction of how hurt Alan would be by this.\n\nHe and Mae heard the dragging sound of Alan’s footsteps at the same time. She pulled back and Nick tried to follow her mouth but did not push the issue when she turned her face away, her breath wavering against his cheek.\n\nAlan was standing at the top of the stairs, his curly hair sleep-ruffled and his kind face startled, about to be hurt. Nick had not realized how much he hated him until now.\n\n“You,” he said. The word came out thick, as if he were snarling through a mouth full of blood.\n\nAlan had stopped looking surprised. His eyes traveled from Nick’s face to Mae’s, and he began to look angry. Alan didn’t have a clue that Nick had ever, for even a moment, liked Mae. The way he saw it, the only reason Nick had for doing this was to hurt him.\n\n“Sorry to interrupt,” he said quietly. He was far too good at lying and keeping secrets to reveal anything in front of Mae. “Can I ask where you’ve been?”\n\n“Where I’ve—” Nick abandoned Mae and started up the stairs, slowly, moving as he did when he was stalking something for the kill. “Where did you go,” he asked, “last Christmas?”\n\nAlan looked shocked. Of course he looked shocked. He’d thought his lies would never be discovered; he’d thought Nick would never suspect. Nick had always believed that Alan did not lie to him, that he was the exception, but why should Alan make an exception for him? He was nothing to Alan.\n\nAfter a moment Alan’s ordinary, gentle face was in place, a mask that Nick hated and wanted to break into a thousand pieces. Nick kept advancing.\n\nAlan said carefully, “What do you know?”\n\n“I know everything!” Nick shouted. “I know that Black Arthur is my father. I know that you’ve been lying to me all my life. You’re not my brother.”\n\nAlan bit his lip. “It’s not that important,” he said in the lying, soothing voice he always used with people who might suspect them. “It’s like being adopted. It doesn’t mean a thing.”\n\n“If it wasn’t important, then why did you lie? Why did you keep lying?”\n\nAlan glanced down the stairs to Mae, and Nick saw he was too hurt to be calm about this. “Because I knew you’d go mad!” Alan snapped. “And you’re not exactly proving me wrong, are you?”\n\n“Shut your lying mouth,” said Nick softly. “It isn’t like being adopted. That’s not why you lied. You hid the fact that your own mother existed; you didn’t even dare tell half a lie and say we were half brothers. You tried to tie me to you and that dead idiot Daniel as tightly as you could. You were scared to death that I’d grow up to be a monster!”\n\n“Don’t talk about Dad like that,” Alan said sharply. “And you’re not a monster.”\n\n“Why not?” Nick asked. “I’m much better at killing than you are. I can call the demons with a piece of chalk and a word. Did you ever think about what that might mean, Alan? Were you ever scared of me?”\n\nAlan flinched, and Nick saw the truth written cleƒuth miarly on his face for once. He’d been scared, all right.\n\nNick wanted to make him scared now.\n\n“You thought I might grow up to be a magician like Black Arthur,” Nick said slowly. “After all, both my parents have a taste for blood.”\n\n“I didn’t,” Alan told him in a thin voice. “I never thought you were anything like Black Arthur. You’re not his son, he didn’t bring you up, he didn’t die for you—”\n\nNick reached Alan at the top of the stairs and roared that thin voice down.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nMen gan cao hơn 600 quay về mức bình thường sau khi dùng thứ này\nChiếc đồng hồ bản sao Omega - thiết kế cho đàn ông trưởng thành\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

It won’t work! Stop thinking that you can manipulate me the way you manipulate everybody else. It makes me sick. Who says Daniel Ryves died for me? Why should he have done anything for me? It was her he wanted. I was something she brought with her, I was something that belonged to the man who stole her from him. What did Daniel Ryves see when he looked at me? Do you think he liked it?”\n\nNick was telling the truth. He didn’t feel guilty, and he didn’t feel sad. It wasn’t hard to stop calling another liar Dad and start calling him Daniel. All he felt was black, twisting fury, the desire to hurt someone, and the knowledge that there was nothing to stop him doing it. Not anymore.\n\nHe saw the shadow pass through Alan’s kind eyes. He saw, quite clearly, Alan’s decision to lie again.\n\n“I’m sure that when Dad looked at you,” he said, “all he saw was his son.”\n\nNick drew back his fist and punched Alan in the face.\n\nThere was an outraged scream from Mae, whom Nick had entirely forgotten. She exclaimed, “Nick, don’t,” and began charging her way up the stairs when the deed was already done.\n\nShe didn’t have a hope, but Alan was no clumsy amateur. He’d rocked back when Nick’s fist connected, and he was falling when Nick glanced at Mae. There was a twist of movement in Nick’s eye, and that was all the warning he got before Alan pulled a gun on him.\n\nThe barrel was cold against Nick’s jaw. Alan’s grip on it was steady.\n\n“Don’t do that again,” Alan said, blood blooming from the broken corner of his mouth and trickling down his chin.\n\nMae hesitated on the stairs and did not come any closer.\n\nNick turned his face in toward the gun and spoke into the barrel as if it was a microphone.\n\n“If it was adoption,” Nick sneered, letting his mouth brush the steel, “why didn’t you tell me about Durham? Why didn’t you tell your precious Aunt Natasha about your adoptive family? We could have all gone to stay with your real family at Christmas — you, your crazy new mother, and a murderous magician’s son make three.”\n\n“Nick,” Alan said, and made a small sound of frustration. “You’re my real family. It was just that — please try to understand. It was just that I wanted to remember how things were when Mum was alive and everything was all right. I just wanted to have a few days of pretending. I never wanted to drag my aunt into this nightmare with me!”\n\n“Too bad,” Nick said. “She got dragged in.”\n\nAlan’s hand did tremble then. For a moment Nick thought he was going to faint, but he just stood there trembling, with his face the whitish gray color of ashes. Nick let his mouth curve upward so that Alan would see him smiling, see that he didn’t care. Alan’s hand tightened on the gun, and for a moment Nick thought that he might use it. Then he lowered it, slowly, as if he thought that he might use it too.\n\n“Nick,” he said, his voice wavering badly and making him sound very young. “Nick, what have you done?”\n\n“I didn’t do anything,” said Nick. “You think I’d care enough to do something to her? Don’t flatter yourself.”\n\n“Did you hurt her, Nick?” Alan asked.\n\nNick made himself keep smiling. “Maybe a little.”\n\nThere was a door standing ajar down the corridor, a silhouette tracing a slightly different darkness onto the shadows. It was either Jamie or his mother, Nick could not tell and did not care. Whoever it was, they were breathing rapidly, as if they were afraid, and standing halfway up the stairs, Mae was breathing too fast as well.\n\nNick did not glance over to see if she looked afraid. He would not have seen the shadow at the open door, if the door had not been directly behind Alan’s head.\n\nHe kept looking at Alan who was not his brother, standing there with a gun hanging limply at his side. Alan’s face was still that terrible color, his eyes avoiding Nick’s, but his thin chest was rising and falling evenly enough. He didn’t look scared. He looked heartsick.\n\n“Listen to me,” Nick said. “Everything’s going to be all right. You don’t need to stay in this nightmare any longer. Your father took me and my mother in. You saved our lives. I’ll pay you back. I’ll get that mark off you. Then it will be even between us, and once it is, I don’t ever want to see your face again.”\n\n12\n\nBlood Calls to Blood\n\nEVERYTHING SEEMED UNNATURALLY CLEAR TO NICK IN the days following his discovery, and he seemed to have lost the ability to attach meaning to particular things. He would look at Mae, who was apparently unable to meet his eyes now, and he would look at Alan trying to eat with one side of his mouth bruised and swollen, and he would not feel anything at all.\n\nHe’d never been like Alan, never been able to take an interest in people, never had a crush or even a real friend. He’d just thought he was more sensible than Alan. Now he thought that perhaps this easy detachment was what allowed his father to offer people up to the demons. Nick sat on the couch, a lumpy brown affair covered in fluff that seemed to be shedding with age, and thought about sacrifice.\n\nThe idea of strangers dying didn’t matter much to him. He could do it, he thought. There was nothing the demons could give him that he wanted, but if there had been, he could have done it.\n\nHe realized distantly that this should frighten him, but fear, like pity, was something that never came. He didn’t want to talk to the others. He didn’t even want to look at them.\n\nHe’d slept on the shabby brown couch since he found out, not that he was sleeping much. He spent the best part of most nights outside in the garden, practicing the sword until he was exhausted, his skin slick with sweat and his mind mercifully empty, and even after that he didn’t sleep well.\n\nThe third night on the sofa he’d almost managed to get to sleep when he heard Alan screaming. Nick rolled automatically off the sofa and was at the top of the stairs before he realized what he was doing.\n\nThe door to Alan’s room was open. Someone had reached him before Nick.\n\nAlan was sitting up in bed. He looked haggard and drained, eyes too dark in a face that was too white, but Mae was sitting with him in the tangle of sheets, and she was holding his hands. Nick couldn’t see her face, but he could see Alan’s. More than that, he could hear Alan’s voice, talking in a low, warm rush that sounded worried and desperate and just a little comforted already.\n\nMae murmured something, her few words lost in the flood of his, and Alan stopped talking for a moment to smile. It wasn’t one of his calculated smiles; it was something helpless and shy. He ducked his head for a moment and then looked up at her again, eyes shining with hope.\n\nAlan would probably go back to Exeter with Mae and Jamie, Nick realized. He’d been thinking that Alan might return to Durham once he was free, but the way he was looking at Mae, he would want to be wherever she was.\n\nMae leaned forward, one of the strings on her string top sliding down the curve of her shoulder, and gave Alan a kiss that landed to one side of his smile, lips brushing the bruise there as if to make it better.\n\nMaybe she’d want that too.\n\nNick slipped back downstairs, footsteps falling as softly as a shadow falls, making sure that nobody saw.\n\nIf he’d stopped to think, he would never have gone to Alan in the first place. Alan was nothing to him.\n\nIt seemed like either Alan or Jamie woke screaming every night now. Time was running out.\n\nNick went to school because it seemed like a good way to avoid them and spent a day wandering the halls silently, thinking about how many schools he’d gone to and had to struggle through because Alan wanted it and Daniel Ryves would have wanted it. He’d tried to be normal, tried to follow his father’s advice, but he wasn’t normal and Daniel Ryves wasn’t his father.\n\nIt all seemed very pointless now.\n\n“Hey,” said Carr, that annoying little terrier snapping at his heels, the last in a line of people he had put up with, had pretended to be like. “Where’ve you been, man?”\n\nNick looked right through him for a long, cold moment, waiting to see him flinch. When he did, Nick turned away, and Carr grabbed his elbow again.\n\n“Hey! What’s gotten into you?”\n\nNick whirled around and punched him. He fell hard, cracking his back against the floor and sliding to hit the wall. Nick stood over him and curled his mouth, watched fear creep over the other boy’s face.\n\n“Nothing,” he whispered. “I’ve always been this way.”\n\nHe went home. It had occurred to him that there was a magician to talk to there.\n\nWhen he came in the door he climbed the stairs, and then climbed another narrow, creaking flight to the attic room where Mum was. It was so rare for him to come to his mother’s room that for a while he simply stared at the worn wood of the door. It wasn’t a barrier. It was nothing but a cheap, flimsy plank of wood. Eventually, since he could come up with no other way to suggest he was on a mission of peace, he knocked on the door.\n\nHis mother’s voice, calm and pleased, called, “Come in!”\n\nWhen Nick came in, she was sitting on a stool, straight-backed, dealing cards for herself on her bed. She turned a smiling face to the door and saw him. The cards slipped out of her hands. Her face shut up like someone securing every door and window so their house would be safe from attack.\n\nNick realized that he always thought of her at her worst, during the screaming fits or the times she had to be medicated. She was always at her worst when Nick was there.\n\nShe’d been able to hold down a job when they really needed it, though. She got on well with Alan, who was not her son any more than he was Nick’s brother, and she seemed to be friendly with Mae. She was not as mad as he had always told himself, and if she were, it was his father’s fault.\n\n“Do you want me to get those?”\n\nNick meant the words to be polite, but they came out abrupt. Well, it was no use pretending. He and his mother had always been enemies, and now he knew why.\n\n“No,” his mother said. Nick looked at her and remembered staring into the pale eyes of the wolf he’d strangled, knowing that there was human intelligence behind the wolf’s eyes, and also knowing that she would kill him if she could.\n\nHe walked toward her, and Mum scrambled up from her stool, her movements awkward as if panic had wiped away control of her own limbs, and Nick discovered something else.\n\nMum was afraid of him. It had never occurred to him before, since she had no reason to be frightened of him, but he knew her reason now. He wondered what Black Arthur could possibly have done to her to make her so scared that fifteen years later here she was, backed up against a wall and trembling.\n\nNick held up his hands in surrender and did not move any closer. “I wanted to talk to you.”\n\nShe had her face turned away from him, a strand of black hair fanned across her cheek. “I don’t want to talk to you.”\n\n“Look,” Nick said. “I know about my father. I mean, I know that Black Arthur is my father.” He stopped, but she did not respond to the name, just kept her face turned away and breathed in little gasps, snatching air as if he was about to take it away from her. “Am I like him?” Nick continued. “Do I look like him at all?”\n\nMum made an obvious effort and looked at him. The one window the attic contained was set in the slanted ceiling, and in the space between them was a square of light where dust motes drifted and sparked. Their eyes met across it.\n\n“Yes,” Mum answered. “You look like him.”\n\nIt was strange to think he looked like someone he had never seen. He was not used to looking like anyone but her; he was used to her being the worst part of him.\n\n“I’m leaving Alan,” Nick said. “He has no part in this. I want you to come with me.”\n\n“I’ll die before I go anywhere with you.”\n\nHe had not expected understanding Mum to make everything harder. He could not hate her anymore, and he certainly could not feel anything warmer for her, but he’d thought that if he understood her, she could understand him. He’d expected logic, but there was no logic to be had from her. Black Arthur had seen to that.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐồng hồ bản sao Omega Thụy Sĩ đến Việt Nam, nay giảm 90% 1 ngày\nWatchthuysichinhhang\nQuý ông mê mẩn đồng hồ bản sao từ Thuỵ Sỹ nay giảm 90% chỉ 1 ngày\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

I don’t want to remember anything that happened before.”\n\nShe was trembling, her hands grasping the air as if she had to get a handhold on it or fall. Nick moved toward her instinctively.\n\nHer voice cracked like ice breaking underfoot. “Don’t touch me.”\n\nNick looked at her grasping hands and thought of Alan’s hands, and the way Alan’s mother had hands just like his. Mum’s hands were small, very thin at the wrists, and Nick stared at them and thought about his own hands, large hands with long, brutal-looking fingers made to curve around a sword hilt or a neck.\n\nHe knew who he’d inherited them from. He felt for an instant like the assembled pieces of some weapon Black Arthur had built.\n\nHe turned away from his mother and toward the door. He should not have come.\n\n“I’m not him, you know,” he said over his shoulder.\n\n“I know,” said Mum. “I loved him.”\n\nThat night, when he was practicing the sword in the garden, Mae came to speak to him.\n\nAlan had been pleased by the garden that first morning in the house, when they were still brothers. It was small but the wooden fence was high, hiding them from all the world, and in this hidden place was a weeping willow.\n\nNick did not care about trees or gardens or anything but the clean cut and thrust of his sword and the ache in his muscles that sang through his body as a relief from thought. He pivoted, sliced darkness across the throat, and came within an inch of beheading Mae.\n\nHe caught the downward swing of his sword and stepped back. He did not speak.\n\nMae ducked under a branch of the will‹nche dow, its green fingers trailing through her hair. The May air was warm, but it had a bite to it, and she leaned against the tree and hugged herself.\n\nNick curled his lip and turned his back on her, executing the next movement in his exercises. His sword went glancing through the points of an invisible opponent, throat, chest, thigh, and then he turned and caught one behind him, putting the power of his wrist behind a solid thrust. He let the easy physicality of it take hold of him, that flashing point of steel in the night becoming his single focus in the world, the sustained effort a slow burn through the muscles of his back and arms.\n\nMae’s voice was an unwelcome intrusion in his thoughtless world. It cut through the tactile sensations of effort and exhaustion and pulled him up short.\n\n“When are you going to start talking to your brother again?”\n\nNick turned the sword hilt between his hands, making the blade jump like a fish. He watched Mae jump as well, and wondered if Black Arthur liked to see people squirm before he sacrificed them.\n\n“You must’ve mistaken me for someone else,” he told her. “I don’t have a brother.”\n\n“You do have a brother,” Mae said. “And I’m worried about him.”\n\n“Oh?” said Nick, and lunged forward to slash the air above her head, to her left, to her right. He cut a door in the air for her to walk through and, panting slightly, demanded, “If you’re so worried about him, why don’t you go comfort him?”\n\nA trickle of sweat was running between his shoulder blades, the cool current in the air washing down his back and making him shiver. He saw Mae notice, and let her see him smile.\n\n“Or maybe you’d rather comfort me?”\n\nMae looked up at him silently, eyes dark in the pale upturned oval of her face. The willow was casting long shadows on her skin, like the stripes of darkness cast by a shutter. Her eyes were not like pools, but there was something trembling under their surface.\n\nNick sheathed his sword and leaned in.\n\nHe reached out with lazy intent to touch her hair, and she grabbed his wrist an instant before he touched her.\n\n“Think a lot of yourself, don’t you?”\n\nNick blinked. “I thought—”\n\n“You think you can use me as a way to punish Alan,” said Mae. “I noticed.”\n\n“That wouldn’t be the only reason,” Nick told her, leaning against the willow by her side. The bark was rough against his bare skin.\n\n“Oh, no?” asked Mae. “What’s the other reason?”\n\nNick smiled a small smile that someone watching them would not have been able to see. It touched his lips and lingered for a moment, private and promising. “Might be fun.”\n\n“I don’t think so,” said Mae.\n\nShe stepped away from him. Her eyes were narrowed.\n\n“I’m not stupid,” she said. “I’m attracted to you, I could be attracted to Alan, but what does it matter? I’ve been attracted to people before. I’m not looking to settle down, and I’m not territory to be fought over in your little war. I won’t let myself be used, and I won’t let whatever crisis you’re having hurt my brother’s chance to live.”\n\nNick raised his eyebrows. “Your brother’s chance? Who says he has one?”\n\n“I say he does!”\n\n“I’m not interested in charity work,” Nick informed her. “If you want to save your brother, you’ll have to rely on Alan.”\n\n“I trust Alan,” said Mae, “but I don’t rely on anyone. If I have to, I can kill a magician myself.”\n\n“Really?” Nick drawled. “Didn’t you let one go just the other day?”\n\n“That was stupid,” Mae said. “I should have killed him before he could escape. I won’t be that stupid again.” He saw her hands clench into fists. “And I’m not afraid.”\n\nNick’s eyes traveled over her face. “I believe you,” he said, and watched her relax. “You’re brave,” he added honestly.\n\nWhen she almost smiled, he leaned in again, and she hesitated, her breath coming fast against his lips. She didn’t move.\n\n“You’re brave,” Nick whispered into her mouth, “but that’s not enough.”\n\nIt had been too easy to palm a knife and hold it to her throat when he went in for a kiss. When she swallowed, the edge brushed her skin.\n\n“They’ll surprise you,” Nick continued, looking down into her outraged face. “They’ll use magic; they’ll use demons. You don’t know what you’re doing, and they will get to you before you can get to them.”\n\nMae tipped her head back because of the pressure of the knife against her throat. He’d been telling the truth. She was brave. She didn’t look scared at all. She looked furious.\n\n“Carry a knife from now on if you plan to kill,” Nick continued in a thoughtful, detached voice. He grinned at her and added, “Make sure to catch them by surprise.”\n\nShe glared silently up at him.\n\nHe drew the knife across her throat, lightly, not cutting her, but making sure she could feel the edge slide against her skin. “Slash across the throat or”—he trailed the point down her body, the blade skimming from the vulnerable hollow at her throat over the fragile material of her shirt—“under the ribs. Don’t even try for between the ribs. Amateurs always hit a rib, and if they try for the heart, they always hit the breastbone. Across the throat or under the ribs for a killing blow. Do you understand that?”\n\nMae drove her fist into his stomach, at a point under his ribs. “You’re an ass,” she said, between her teeth. “Do you understand that?”\n\nHe ignored the pain and smiled. “You’d better pray Alan will protect you and Jamie,” he said. “As far as I’m concerned, you’re on your own.”\n\nHe touched his knife, and the blade withdrew into its hilt with a soft snick. He slipped it into Mae’s pocket, then turned away and stooped to pick up his sword, unsheathing it and beginning to execute a few more passes.\n\nIf anything, his return to routine made Mae angrier. When he turned to face her, bringing the sword up and around in an overarm pass, she was trembling with fury.\n\n“You’re the one on your own,” she said.\n\nNick swung and ducked an imaginary enemy’s swing in return, legs bent and thighs braced. “I can take care of myself.”\n\n“You’re going to be miserable,” Mae told him, and stormed back to the house.\n\nHe watched her go, squaring her shoulders. Before she opened the door, he saw her touch her face and wondered if she was crying.\n\nNick stepped backward, spun, and parried another imaginary blow. He silently congratulated himself on the way he’d made her angry enough to forget all about discussing Nick’s so-called brother.\n\nHe swung again. These exercises with the sword were nothing like real fights; they were just a way of keeping ready for real fights, making sure his reflexes were still fast and the weight of the sword did not tire him.\n\nEventually he did get tired. He felt as if the heaviness of steel had been shot through his bones and had settled cold in the pit of his stomach. He was exhausted and chilled and he had to force himself not to think.\n\nAcross the dark, ragged patch of garden the window of their kitchen shone, a square of orange light. The curtains were open, and through the glass Nick could hear faint music playing. Jamie was dancing around like an idiot, and Mae was leaning against the door looking at Jamie, her face smoothing out into calm. Alan was cooking something, and when Jamie pushed the wooden spoon he’d been singing into like a microphone over Alan’s shoulder, Alan turned to Jamie, and Nick glimpsed Alan’s smile. Over the strains of the radio came the sudden deep, sweet sound of Alan singing. Mae looked startled and impressed, and she started to smile too.\n\nNick could have gone in, but he couldn’t go in and be one of them.\n\nHe turned away from the ordinary people laughing in the warmth, and wondered if magicians felt this empty and cold all the time. He raised his sword, on guard, and launched himself into the murder of shadows.\n\nThe morning sky was paling after the sunrise into an indeterminate white that would be followed by blue, and when Nick opened the door, the inside of the house looked gray. He went into the little kitchen with the usual worn-thin cork tiles and stopped dead at the sight of Alan.\n\nAlan was sitting at the kitchen table. He looked as worn as the cork tiles, the circles under his eyes looking more like bruises than ever, deep purple and spreading like stains. They matched the real bruise at the side of his mouth.\n\n“I wondered when you were going to come in,” he said, his voice weary.\n\nNick said nothing. He went over to the kettle and flipped it on, then rifled through the cupboards to find instant coffee. The door of one of the cupboards was hanging lopsided, he noticed, and the cork tiling was curling up in one of the corners of the room. They had lived in grimly poor places like this since Dad had died, and Nick had not thought about it much beyond being relieved that they were not hungry or cold.\n\nHe remembered Natasha Walsh’s house. Alan had been born into a different kind of life.\n\n“I want to talk to you,” Alan said, and Nick turned round and fixed Alan with a cold stare at the precise moment that Jamie walked into the kitchen.\n\nHe was still in his pajamas, one cheek marked with the lines from his pillow, and for a second all he did was look bewildered. Then he seemed to take in the situation, and backed up a step. His eyes swiveled in all directions, looking for escape, and they lit on the jar of coffee and the boiling kettle.\n\n“Oh look, coffee,” he said weakly. “Excellent.”\n\n“You don’t like coffee, Jamie,” Alan said.\n\n“It was just a random burst of enthusiasm for — the general concept of coffee,” Jamie told him, and he gave Alan what was clearly meant to be a reassuring smile. “Is everything all right?”\n\nJamie and Alan were both white and terribly wasted, as if the demons were going to wear them away to pallid ghosts who wandered the house with their eyes huge and imploring in their thin faces. Alan seemed worse hit than Jamie, battered and strained by the demonic assault, but Nick had no doubt as to who would give in first. Jamie looked frail as a single flame in a blast of wind, a trembling thread of light that was about to go out.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nGiảm cân họ phạm giúp thổi bay 5-7kg tại nhà chỉ sau vài tuần.\nDongytaybac\nĐồng hồ bản sao Omega Thụy Sĩ đến Việt Nam, nay giảm 90% 1 ngày\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

As if Jamie could possibly do anything to protect Alan.\n\n“Everything’s fine,” Alan replied, but he looked grateful.\n\nNick crossed his arms over his chest and asked Alan, “What did you want to talk to me about?”\n\nHe was rather glad that Jamie was there. It had always been him and Alan in the past. It would have been too familiar, too easy to fall back into the habit of acting as if they were a team, but Jamie’s presence made it clear that everything had changed. Alan belonged with Jamie and other normal people, and Nick was one of the magicians. They were not family.\n\n“There’s a spell,” Alan said slowly. “It’s just a small spell. The magicians’ name for it is the blood calling spell. It means your family can always find you.”\n\n“Explain further,” Nick ordered.\n\nHe was talking in the way he always talked to people he didn’t know well and didn’t like much, every word the equivalent of throwing a stone. He knew Alan recognized it.\n\nAlan did not rise to the bait. He kept his eyes on the plastic sheen of their tablecloth, and he explained. “Say the name. Say the spell. Spill a little blood, and then you can follow the trail of that blood.”\n\n“Follow the trail of my blood,” said Nick, because Alan didn’t want to say it and Nick wanted him to hear it at least. “To my father’s.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You knew Black Arthur was my father all along,” Nick remarked thoughtfully. “You could have done this spell at any time. Why didn’t you?”\n\nAlan did look up at him then. His eyes looked hurt, but his whole white, bruised face told a story of pain, and a little more could make no difference.\n\n“I didn’t want you to know. I didn’t ever want you to know any of it.”\n\n“Your concern is very touching,” Nick sneered. “And you risked your own stupid life because you couldn’t bear to tell me something so horrible? How noble. Only, wait — you risked Jamie’s stupid life as well. That’s not very noble.”\n\nHe gave Jamie a deliberate, amused look from under his eyelids, seeing how the boy received this news. Jamie’s face betrayed nothing, but his hands were shaking as he made himself a cup of tea.\n\n“I put you first,” Alan said in a tired way. “I always have. And no, it’s not very noble at all.”\n\nNick threw a kitchen knife at him.\n\nJamie almost dropped his tea, and Alan caught the knife by the handle with no fuss, looking thoughtfully at the serrated edge. Nick didn’t want to waste one of their hunting knives on himself. The kitchen knife would do if he stayed still.\n\n“Very thoughtful of you,” Alan said, laying down the knife and drawing a blade from his belt. “But actually, I’ve got one of my own.”\n\nNick recognized the knife, the wickedly sharp point and the signs for power and protection carved in the steel hilt. He remembered weapons glittering under the lights of the Goblin Market, being happy about his brother’s present and hearing Alan say so casually, I’ve been thinking we could use an enchanted knife.\n\nHe wondered how long Alan had been planning this.\n\nHe asked, “How much blood do you need?”\n\n“Jamie,” Alan said, “could you fetch me a saucer?”\n\nJamie put down his mug, tea slopping onto the kitchen counter, and mutely fetched down a saucer from the cupboard with the door askew. He put it in the center of the table. Nick strolled over to the table and took the chair opposite Alan. He had his gaze fixed at a point beyond Alan’s ear at first, but then Alan flinched, so Nick looked directly at him. Alan blinked, looking exhausted and owlish and a little stupid, and Nick put all the chilly distance he had been feeling these past few days into his eyes. He made his stare long and cold as winter.\n\n“Come on, then,” he said in a low challenge and held out his arm, elbow on the table and hand half-curled into a fist, as if they were going to arm wrestle. “What are you waiting for?”\n\nAlan’s gaze was steady now and entirely blank. “Take off your talisman.”\n\nIt was so strange that Nick paused. Alan had always stressed how important it was for Nick to keep his talisman on if he wanted to be safe.\n\nWell, Nick had always hated the thing, and he wasn’t particularly interested in being safe anymore. He drew the talisman off and put it down on the table as if he were laying down his‹layhin stake in a card game. Alan looked at him steadily, recognizing and accepting the stakes, and reached out for him. Nick forced himself not to pull away.\n\nAlan trailed two fingers along Nick’s arm, the touch light and expert. The blue veins stood out clearly against the dead-white skin, and Alan traced the largest vein until he chose a spot. Nick wanted him to get on with it. He was glad when Alan took his hand away: He preferred the knife.\n\n“Say the name,” Alan commanded.\n\nNick said, low, “Black Arthur.”\n\nAlan cut swift and deep. There was no hesitation, nor any trying to spare Nick pain, which would have cost him more pain. There was just the slice of the knife and the moment of shock.\n\nA line appeared in the knife’s wake, beaded with blood, and slowly the line opened into a jagged cut. Blood dripped down Nick’s arm and he angled it so that the blood fell into the saucer, which filled drop by drop. A splash of blood on white china looked almost like a flower, but then Nick squeezed his arm slightly to create a steady flow of blood, and the flower was swallowed up in a pool.\n\n“I claim the right of kinship,” Alan said. “I claim blood and bone.”\n\nNick saw Alan dip his finger into the blood and put it to his lips, but he was more concerned by the sudden stir in the blood still in his veins, as if the iron in it were being called to by a magnet very far away.\n\n“I claim the right to follow you,” Alan continued. “I claim you for my own.”\n\nThey were silent then, waiting for enough blood to flow, loosing the blood so it could call out to another body. Nick lifted his eyes from the blood snaking down his arm and met Alan’s eyes, closer than he had expected.\n\n“You didn’t have to include yourself in that spell. You didn’t need to taste the blood.”\n\n“It makes more sense this way,” Alan said casually. “Now both of us can trace him.”\n\nThe cut in Nick’s arm was starting to throb dully with the pressure he was putting on it. He kept looking at Alan. “How many times have you lied to me?” he asked in a soft voice.\n\nAlan replied, equally softly, “I’ve lost count.”\n\nThe saucer was brimming with blood by now.\n\nAlan leaned forward to inspect the cut. “That’s enough,” he said, and produced their first-aid kit from under the seat. He was unrolling a bandage when Nick snatched the kit away.\n\n“I can do it for myself.”\n\nAs he wrapped the bandage ruthlessly tight around his arm, he began to feel a tingling sensation. It was like the time Alan had persuaded him to donate blood, the tightening of his veins and the pull at his blood. Only this time there was no point where the blood could drain away, and the tug was not only in the veins of his arm but in all the veins running through his body, as if the tide of his blood had turned and was roaring toward a strange shore.\n\nHe was at one end of a line. The line stretched out somewhere in this city and connected him to his father.\n\nJamie’s voice rang out, sounding all wrong in the tense silence, like a discordant note played on a taut string.\n\n“Did it work?”\n\nNick nodded slowly, not taking his eyes off Alan.\n\n“I’ll get Mae.”\n\nJamie dashed out, and they heard his headlong rush up the stairs. Alan rose abruptly.\n\nHe must have been sitting on that chair for hours, getting his leg stiff. He must have been more tired than he knew. Nick rarely saw Alan stumble.\n\nHe stumbled now, and would have fallen, except that Nick leaped up and caught his elbow. Alan’s weight hit Nick’s palm hard, and a bolt of pain shot up Nick’s arm. He realized that he had reached out thoughtlessly and caught Alan with his injured arm.\n\nHe kept his face impassive. Alan righted himself in the space of a breath, but when Nick let go of him, Alan grabbed his wrist.\n\n“Don’t leave me,” Alan said.\n\nNick tilted his head to look at him from another angle. No matter how he looked at him, Alan still made no sense. “I hurt you,” he said slowly. “Why would you want me to stay?”\n\n“Oh God, Nick!” Alan said, his voice cracking. “Can’t you even understand that much?”\n\nNick didn’t understand at all. It made no sense until he remembered how big Alan was on kindness. Nick wasn’t his brother, but he would let Nick stay out of pity, the same way he’d adopt a stray kitten.\n\nHe fixed Alan with his coldest look, the one that made everyone back away, and promised, “If I stay, I’ll hurt you again.”\n\nAlan did not back away. He did not even look away.\n\nIn the end, it was Nick who let his eyes drop. His gaze fell on his talisman, and he picked it up and slipped it on over his head almost automatically, and then felt furious with himself for doing so.\n\nHe went to the door, still not looking at Alan, and added over his shoulder, “But I won’t stay.”\n\nHe walked into the hall, and Mae, from the top of the stairs, ordered, “Don’t go anywhere!”\n\n“Beg pardon?” said Nick.\n\nShe ran down the stairs looking flushed and purposeful, her jewelry jingling as she went. “What’s the address?”\n\n“We did a spell — we didn’t leaf through a Tourist’s Guide to the Magicians of London,” Nick snapped.\n\nJamie, standing behind Mae, said tentatively, “Maybe if you visualized yourself walking through all the possible stages that the — the spell wants you to, that might help finding a location.”\n\nNick was about to growl at Jamie to shut up and stop talking to him like a teacher, but the spell tugged at him particularly strongly for one sharp, sweet instant, and he closed his eyes and did envision taking every step the spell wanted him to take, going through a rich neighborhood he’d never seen before. A street sign hung in the darkness behind his eyes for a moment.\n\nSomewhat to his amazement, Nick opened his mouth, and in a voice that did not sound like his own, gave her an address off Royal Avenue. He was still standing stunned when Mae grabbed her coat.\n\n“I mean it, Nick,” she said. “Stay put.”\n\nShe was gone in a whirl of green coat and bright jewelry. Nick heard the sound of her shoes drumming on the pavement outside. She was going somewhere at a dead run, and he couldn’t imagine that she was taking a taxi to go see the evil magicians.\n\nNick shook his head and went upstairs. He was going to try and sleep a few hours in a proper bed so he could be fresh when the time came to kill.\n\nWhen he came downstairs, it was past noon and Mae had returned. She, Jamie, and Alan were clustered around the kitchen table, talking loudly. Spread over the table was a floor plan of Black Arthur’s house.\n\n“Where did you get this?” Alan asked. “Did you go to the Market people?”\n\nMae blinked. “I went to planning information at the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and pretended to be Arthur’s niece doing a school project.”\n\n“Oh,” said Alan. “Yeah, I guess that might work too.”\n\nJamie was beaming at his sister with fond proprietary pride. Nick looked down at the cork tiles.\n\n“Soon she may break out a graph. She gets the businesslike practicality from Mum,” Jamie said. “I got the blond genes. Clearly, I win.”\n\n“Shut up, I’m nothing like Mum,” Mae said, scowling. “Though speaking of business — this floor plan does come with a price.” She lifted her chin. “I’m coming with you guys.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐau rát cổ họng triền miên?

Triệt tiêu ngay\n\n“You’re not,” Nick snapped. “You’ll just get hurt.”\n\nMae started rolling up the floor plan. “Did you have a plan?” she demanded. “Besides ‘go in there and kill everyone I see’?”\n\n“I only plan to kill two people,” Nick said. “Killing everyone isn’t part of the plan. Though it would be a nice bonus.”\n\n“Oh, now you’re planning to kill two people?” Mae asked. “I thought Jamie and I were on our own. So I had to make my own plan.” She glared at him, and Jamie, amazingly enough, looked all sad and betrayed. This was ridiculous.\n\n“My plan was just to get in,” Alan confessed. He was looking at Mae with appreciation. Nick could tell he was ready to let her have her way.\n\n“This is about my brother,” Mae said. “I thought of the floor plan. I might be able to do something else when we’re inside. I don’t want to be safe. I want the chance to be useful.” She looked around for argument, and when it did not come she squared her shoulders, rolled the floor plan out again, and smiled. “This place is big,” she continued. “There are four of us; if we split up I think we could cover it more quickly.”\n\n“Good thinking,” Alan said. “A group of two is quieter than a group of four. If we split up, we have a better chance of catching and killing two magicians before they realize we’re there.”\n\nHe and Mae had their heads bowed close together over the plans, talking about what Market charms Alan could bring with him.\n\nNick was trying to think. He should’ve considered Alan’s obsession with helping Jamie. Alan was never going to let his mark be taken off without Jamie’s being wiped away too.\n\nAlan was right about splitting up as well. They would have a much better chance of surprising the magicians if they went in pairs. Only Mae and Jamie couldn’t be a pair. In spite of Mae’s bravado, they would be totally helpless without Nick and Alan. Those two weren’t fighters. Nick and Alan were the ones who knew how to kill.\n\nNick would kill a magician for Jamie first and get that out of the way, then. The whole house would be full of them. It shouldn’t be too hard. After that, Alan wouldn’t be able to put any more obstacles in Nick’s path. He could get Alan’s mark off, and once he did that it didn’t really matter what happened.\n\n“I’ll take Jamie,” Nick said loudly.\n\nThey had no car because Nick had abandoned it on Tower Bridge, so they had to take the Tube to go hunting for magicians. None of them talked much. Nick stood braced as the train rattled through tunnels with a sound like bones shaking in a drum, and tried to ignore the feel of his blood pulling at his veins like a child tugging his sleeve to get his attention.\n\nThis way, his blood seemed to be whispering to him. Faster. He was going as fast as he could.\n\nThey changed from the Central to the Piccadilly line because Nick thought that was right, and Alan did not argue with him. Nick missed driving. Strangers were pressing all around him, and he had to be careful to keep his back to the wall. If anyone was pushed against him and felt the shape of his sword, fastened in a sheath along his spine, there would be trouble.\n\nHe just wanted to get to the magicians. He did not think beyond the relief of that, of ending this restless search, calming the new urgency in his blood, and making a kill.\n\nWhen they reached Knightsbridge station, his blood tingled as if his whole body was a limb that had gone asleep and was now being punished with pins and needles. He saw Alan look up and swing the bag in his lap onto his shoulder.\n\n“Here,” Alan said, and Nick nodded and started shoving his way through the post-lunchtime passengers. The others followed in his wake.\n\nOnce on the platform he felt a metal point brush his neck and he palmed his switchblade before he realized he was being threatened with the tip of a woman’s umbrella. The woman passed by indifferently, and Nick smiled grimly after her.\n\nThey came out at the entrance near Harrods and stood staring up at the heavy stone buildings with their white-casemented, rectangular windows, letting the flood of shoppers go by. Then they walked along the streets until they were past the biggest shops and moving by the hotels, stately white buildings with gilt fittings to mark the fact that they were not homes.\n\nNick’s blood pounded in his temples, urging him on. It took them twenty minutes until the rows of hotels and office buildings slowly turned into houses.\n\nThey were not like the House of Mezentius, hidden behind deep gardens and high gates. Along these streets, the houses were on display. They walked past houses more than five floors high that had darkened chandeliers in the windows and pointed roofs. Some houses had large carved doors with circular windows above them like crowns.\n\nNone of them were the house Nick wanted, until they turned a corner onto another wide west Knightsbridge street and saw before them the first house in another row. It had deep, polished-looking stone steps leading to the white front door, which had a shining knocker. All the windows were big, the wide expanses of glass reflecting the morning sunlight, except for one small window at the peaked top of the building.\n\nThere was nothing about this house to set it apart from all the rich houses surrounding it, except for the singing in Nick’s blood.\n\nThis was the lair of the Obsidian Circle. This was the house of Nick’s father.\n\n13\n\nThe Trick\n\n“NICE PLACE,” NICK DRAWLED. “MUST BE GOOD MONEY IN feeding people to demons.”\n\nHe climbed the steps and found his smallest knife. He’d learned how to pick locks when he was nine. It had come in handy at times when they had to run and sometimes found themselves with no money and nowhere to go.\n\nThere was a difference between breaking into a deserted house so you could sleep for the night and breaking into a house full of magicians. Nick tried to be very quiet. He didn’t glance behind him; he knew that Alan would have the others casually arranged in front of him so nobody could see what he was doing.\n\nAfter a while, the lock whispered a soft surrender and the front door swung open. Alan was beside Nick with his gun already out, but the hall was empty. Alan took an amulet out of his bag and rolled it into the magicians’ hall. The amulet was a minor one, meant to neutralize all small magics, such as an alarm set to warn the magicians of intruders.\n\nWith the door to the magicians’ lair wide open and the wards neutralized, they turned and walked away. They went around the side of the house. Nick put his shoulder to the garden gate and broke it with ease.\n\nInside was an overgrown garden. This one had no willow, only high grass and the dry, tangled branches of dead rosebushes.\n\n“That’s magicians for you,” Jamie said, his voice wobbling. “Everyone gets all caught up in the demon summoning. Nobody mows the lawn.”\n\nAlan knelt with a moment’s difficulty in the high grass and began to rummage in his bag. He took out a climbing rope with a grappling hook attached. It had been Daniel Ryves’s once.\n\nHe passed it to Nick silently, and Nick whirled it over his head and caught the iron gutter of the house first try. He pulled at the rope a few times, testing the strength of the gutter, and then nodded.\n\nHe could’ve made the climb without a rope, but none of the others could.\n\nRope secured, they waited. Mae and Alan had planned this out. They had to give the magicians enough time to notice that the door was open and their wards were down. Once the alarm was raised, the magicians should start combing the house from the ground up. It would be the perfect time to enter from the roof.\n\nThere were bound to be lone magicians shut up studying or summoning on the upper floors. With luck and speed, they should be able to pick two of them off.\n\nIt would take a lot of luck, and first they had to manage to get up there.\n\nThey counted ten minutes before Nick climbed the rope. It was as easy as he’d thought it would be, and once he was on the roof, Alan attached the harness to his belt and Nick drew the rope up, doubling it around his fists and drawing Alan up along with it. That was easy too. Alan had grown thinner and thinner in the last month, and now he hardly weighed anything at all.\n\nHe hauled Jamie up as well, and then Mae did not put on the climbing harness. She gave Nick a look that said she was still angry about last night in the garden, and began climbing up the rope herself. Nick looked away over a sea of pointed slate-gray roofs.\n\nHe didn’t see her lose her grip on the rope and fall. He heard Alan cry out, looked around sharply, and saw her suspended in midair, looking confused and terrified. He saw Jamie, braced on the edge of the roof, looking terrified as well.\n\nJamie pulled on the air as if it were an invisible rope, and as his hands moved, Mae was tugged upward, inch by inch, until she reached the gutter. She grabbed it in a convulsive movement and scrambled onto the roof tiles, and Jamie let out a deep breath and let his shoulders relax.\n\nThen Jamie cast a deeply apprehensive look around at them all.\n\n“Well, well,” Nick said. “What have we here?”\n\nHe thought of Mae when they’d first met, talking about the weird things that had happened when she was young and saying she was psychic herself. He thought about how easily Jamie had believed everything they’d told him, and about Jamie’s plate breaking when all the glasses broke. He remembered Gerald and how he’d looked at Jamie, how Jamie hadn’t been blinded by the magician’s sand in the bar in Salisbury, and he thought about the timid air Jamie always wore, deliberately receding into the background, purposely camouflaged.\n\nHe thought about his own voice back in Exeter when all of this had just begun, saying, A few people in this world are born with a certain amount of magic, but they don’t grow out of it. They either learn to control it and keep it a secret forever, or they try to do something with the magic.\n\nHe cursed himself for a fool.\n\n“You,” Mae said in a shaking voice. “It was never me at all. It was you. Why didn’t you tell me?”\n\n“I—” Jamie said, and stopped. “I didn’t want you to know,” he said softly. “I didn’t want you to — feel any differently about me. I wanted it not to be true.”\n\n“I’m sorry,” Alan said in a quiet voice. “But we don’t have time for this. We have to move.”\n\nMae looked as if she was about to snap at Alan, but she controlled herself with a visible effort. She rose on trembling legs and went over to Jamie, pushing his hair back the way she did every morning at breakfast.\n\n“All right. We’ll talk about this later, but — it’s all right.”\n\n“Let’s go,” said Nick, and carefully, one by one, they lowered themselves to slip in through the attic windows and into the house of the magicians.\n\nIt was a very fancy attic. There was an expensive-looking carpet on the floor, royal blue and goldenrod-yellow, and the ceiling was full of curves and shadows. They all stood looking at each other, panting in the silence, all a little uncertain now that the plan was about to be put into action.\n\nMae grabbed Jamie in a sudden hug.\n\n“Don’t worry,” she said, holding his thin shoulders in a death grip. “I’m not worried. It’s all going to be okay.”\n\nJamie patted her on the back, looking shaky but enormously relieved, and said, “Okay.”\n\n“All this time wasting is very touching,” Nick observed. “Shall we go?”\n\nHe turned his back on Alan without a word; next time he saw him, Alan would be unmarked and free to go and live in the world he had been born into. Nick did not plan to bother him again.\n\nBehind him, Alan said, “Nick. Don’t — if you see Black Arthur, don’t talk to him. Don’t listen to a word he says.”\n\n“Why?” Nick asked. “Will he lie to me? Imagine that.”\n\nTwisting the knife worked. There was a significant pause before Alan was able to say, “I’m sorry.”\n\n“For which lie in particular?”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nBí mật detox gan và tế bào hóa ra lại cực kì đơn giản và tiện lợi\nTấp nập người mua chiếc đồng hồ bản sao Omega này khi nó giảm 90%\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

Jamie swallowed again and followed Nick as he made his way down the stairs.\n\nHe hadn’t said much while the others were planning, but he had insisted on leaving the attic, and access to the roof, to Alan and Mae. That would give them the best chance of getting out.\n\nThe magicians’ Circle must have owned this house for some time. There were no signs of a rushed and recent move, and now that they were inside, it was obviously a magicians’ house. The place was filled with charms that would have fetched a good price at the Goblin Market. There were protective symbols cut into the glass of some windows. There was a chandelier in the shape of a dream catcher, feathers and net carved out of crystal and catching the pale noon light. Nick walked under it and along the corridors softly as a cat, glancing occasionally backward to make sure that Jamie was close behind him and not about to cause any trouble.\n\nOnce when he turned around, Jamie was not behind him but a few paces back, studying something on a table.\n\n“What are you doing?” he snapped, but quietly.\n\n“What’s this?” Jamie whispered.\n\nHe picked up the little glass shape in his hands, turning it over, and the glass, which had shown a flurry of golden autumn leaves, suddenly burst into green leaves and bright sunlight.\n\n“It’s a season tetrahedron,” Nick said. “Like a snow globe, but depending what side you look at, it shows a different season.”\n\n“It’s beautiful,” Jamie murmured. He turned the season tetrahedron again and got drifting white snowflakes.\n\n“Yes, it’s lovely,” Nick agreed flatly. “And completely worth being killed because you were too busy looking at toys to keep an eye out for magicians. Don’t get left behind. Don’t think I will not leave you to die.”\n\nJamie put down the season tetrahedon in a hurry, the glass chinking against the marble tabletop. He took a step backward, toward Nick, and shoved his hands in his pockets.\n\n“Don’t worry,” he said. “I know you would.”\n\nNick was mildly startled by Jamie’s tone. As they walked on, he glanced over at Jamie, whose face was pale above a dark hooded sweatshirt. Nick took a moment to be annoyed by the flash of his earring. He’d never blend into the shadows if they had to hide. That little glint would catch anyone’s eye.\n\n“I can’t work you out,” Jamie felt the need to inform him, because he was an idiot who never stopped talking. He seemed determined and was speaking low enough, so Nick didn’t even try to stop him. “You’ve been okay to me sometimes, but I can’t tell if that means you like me. I don’t know if you like anyone, I don’t know if you can like anyone. I thought at least there was Alan, but then you hit him.”\n\nJamie was furious with him, Nick realized. He supposed it made sense. Jamie hated violence so much.\n\n“I’ve never thought about you enough to dislike you,” Nick said. “I just think you’re useless.”\n\n“And I think you’re scary,” Jamie snapped. “So we’re even.”\n\nThere was not a sound, not even the creak of a floorboard, but Nick popped the knife from his wrist sheath all the same. He felt more comfortable with a knife in his hand.\n\n“We’re not even. You’re causing me a lot of trouble, and I am saving your pointless life.”\n\n“You wouldn’t have lifted a finger to help us if Alan hadn’t insisted. Alan’s the one who wants to help people. You don’t want to help people. I don’t think you even see most people as people. You remind me of — someone I used to know.” Jamie bit his lip. “He was terrifying as well.”\n\nThere was a moving shadow down the hall, but after a moment of observation, Nick saw it was a tapestry fixed to the wall only by the top. It was fluttering in a breeze and covered with symbols to attract wealth and power.\n\n“You only do the right thing because Alan wants you to,” Jamie continued, still sounding furious. “Without him, I’m pretty sure you’d be a monster.”\n\nNick bared his teeth at Jamie. “So I’m a monster,” he murmured. “Are you scared?”\n\nBelow them came the sound of running footsteps, sudden and clear. Jamie jumped and grabbed for Nick’s arm, making a small, startled sound. Nick whirled and pushed Jamie up against the wall, a hand over his mouth.\n\n“Shh,” he hissed. “Try to remember there are monsters here. Besides me.”\n\nJamie nodded. Nick could hear his own heart beating far too fast as they waited, both tense, for another sound, for a door to open or a voice to speak.\n\nNothing came. After a moment he released Jamie.\n\n“Sorry,” Jamie whispered. “I just wanted to talk to you. I wanted to say — that I think you should forgive Alan. We all have our secrets.”\n\n“You certainly do,” Nick sneered, and Jamie bit his lip again.\n\nHe almost wanted to talk to Jamie about that. It was obvious that Jamie had as much potential to be a magician as Nick did. For days all Nick had been able to think of were images of Black Arthur and demons and death.\n\nIt was impossible to think of Jamie in those terms, though. Nick could ask him, perhaps, how he controlled his power. If Nick could find some way not to be like Black Arthur, Alan would be pleased.\n\nExcept that it would be impossible for Nick to be harmless and well-meaning, to be like Jamie. And Alan was a liar.\n\n“I don’t want anyone to talk to me,” Nick snarled. “What difference do words make? He’s not my brother.”\n\n“What does that matter?” Jamie demanded. “Don’t you understand—”\n\n“No,” Nick growled. “I understood being brothers. I understood that word, but now I don’t understand anything and — Shut up and get behind me!”\n\nJamie went white and ran to obey him. Nick now had an unobstructed view of what he had seen bearing down on them over Jamie’s shoulder. He sheathed his knife, reached behind him, and drew his sword. Then he stood waiting.\n\nJamie’s voice quavered behind him. “Is that a magician?”\n\n“It used to be,” Nick said.\n\nA demon could animate a corpse. They didn’t like to do it. They preferred all the sensations that went with the living, and besides, the living lasted longer.\n\nWhen there was no body but a dead one available, though, a demon would make do.\n\nNick recognized this one. She was the woman he’d killed last week as a wolf. Now her eyes were black and turning to fluid, her yellow hair was tangled, and the smell was worse than the sight of her.\n\nBehind him, Jamie said, “I’m not all that accustomed to the walking dead. Is it all right if I cry with terror?”\n\nNick kept his eyes on the body. He stepped back a few paces, Jamie thankfully having the sense to step back with him, so he could get a proper look at her. She was shuffling rather than walking, hands limp by her sides even though her face was intelligent and purposeful. She was being careful, because this body was almost at its limit.\n\nThis was going to be almost too easy.\n\nNick grinned and waited, shifting the sword hilt in his hands. The body advanced, feet dragged forward by willpower alone, and as she did, her discolored lips twitched into a grin back.\n\nNick stepped backward again and took one hand off the sword hilt to beckon her on.\n\nShe lunged and he swung at the same time, the blow connecting powerfully with her neck. The body spasmed, and Nick had to swing and hit twice more, hacking at the neck, until her head came off. It rolled down that solemn, picture-lined corridor. Her hands clawed feebly at the air, trying to get to Nick, and then stilled.\n\nNick turned to Jamie before the body hit the floor. “They’re not hard to kill,” he said. “It’s just that most people panic, seeing the dead.”\n\n“Oh, they panic, do they?” Jamie asked in a hollow voice. “I can’t imagine why.”\n\nNick knelt and wiped his sword clean with the charmed tapestry. Blood was much easier to clean off than the stuff that you got on your sword after killing the dead, and he was rubbing vigorously when he heard the voice.\n\nIt came from behind the nearest door.\n\nIt was a man’s voice, and it sounded like he was alone. Mae’s plan had worked. They’d caught a magician studying.\n\n“Hellebore and belladonna in a true lover’s knot,” he said, as if he was reading aloud from a book.\n\nThis was a magician, all right.\n\n“Get behind me,” Nick ordered again.\n\nIt was too good a chance to miss, but it could be a trick. He sheathed his sword and felt in the sheath at his belt for his throwing knife. A throwing knife was tricky; he might have only one shot, and that one from a distance. For a moment he wished for one of Alan’s guns.\n\nThe voice went on, quiet and familiar. Nick wondered where he knew it from, and then supposed it might be Gerald. He hoped it was. He wanted a chance to get even with Gerald.\n\n“A child’s tear and a drop of running water blended. All these things make—”\n\nNick pressed his hand flat against the door, and the heavy slab of oak went back easily, its hinges moving smooth as silk. The swift glide of the door opening showed Nick an enormous room with a vaulted ceiling and a wide, polished expanse of wood floor.\n\nAcross the floor a dozen summoning circles were drawn, as if someone had decided to create designs rather than laying down a carpet. The lines for communication and the borders between the worlds cut the floor into gleaming slices. Walking on that floor would be walking into a minefield of magic.\n\nIn the center of the minefield was an indoor bonfire. Flames rose high from every line inside the summoning circle at the middle of the room and arched to meet up near the ceiling in a great golden dome.\n\nUnder the golden dome was Anzu, looking far more birdlike than he had at the Goblin Market. He had a pair of heavy, dark wings that made him sit hunched forward in the flame, and a sharp, curved beak on a human face. From that predator’s beak a quiet voice issued, sounding as if he was reading from a magician’s book.\n\n“All these things make a trap,” finished Anzu, his beak stretching impossibly into a smile.\n\nNick stared and then, under the hiss of the fire, he heard a tiny stifled gasp. That was when he realized the trap was behind him.\n\nHe spun around, but a magician already had one arm locked around Jamie’s throat and a gun pressed against his temple. He was standing directly behind Jamie, and he was no taller; all Nick could see was the graying top of the magician’s head. Nick hoped for a moment that Jamie would do something magical, but then he realized that Jamie had probably used all his magic getting Mae to the roof.\n\nMagicians didn’t have much power on their own. That was why they used demons.\n\nJamie was helpless.\n\nIf Nick tried to throw the knife at the magician, he would hit Jamie.\n\nFortunately, there was another option.\n\nStanding beside Jamie and smiling was another magician. This one was familiar. This one was Gerald.\n\nHe looked as pleasant and foxy-faced as before, his arms folded and his eyes wide. He looked like the perfect target.\n\nNick badly wanted to throw the knife, and he would have done it, if the talisman against his chest had not stirred into sudden restless life. The talisman burned, and suddenly the world looked different.\n\nGerald’s harmless look was another trap. The way Nick’s talisman was reacting, Gerald was already working a spell, something building in the air and ready to be unleashed. It was obvious he had a lot more power than someone his age should. Enough to have hidden all of it before. Enough to make it clear beyond a shadow of doubt that he’d been captured on purpose before. Enough not to bother hiding any of it now as Jamie’s breath came too fast and Nick gripped his knife too tight and the talisman warned him about danger he could not escape.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐau rát cổ họng triền miên?

Đã tìm ra phương pháp bổ rẻ giúp dứt điểm trĩ tại nhà\nSuckhoevungcao\n\nNick lowered the knife slightly, and the burning of his talisman eased.\n\nGerald ducked his head and smiled, for all the world as if he wanted to make friends.\n\n“Should I cut the boy’s throat?” asked the strange magician, who turned out to be a woman.\n\nNick noted her cool, upper-class voice. He wanted details to remember her by.\n\n“No, Laura,” Gerald ordered. “Wait a minute. I want to see something.”\n\nSo Gerald had authority as well as power. Interesting.\n\n“Nick?” Gerald said in a careful tone, as if talking to a pet who showed signs of turning savage. “Would you put down your weapons?”\n\nThe magician called Laura snorted. “You must be mad. Why would—”\n\nNick smiled slowly. “What?” he drawled. “All my weapons?”\n\n“Yes. Put down all your weapons,” Gerald confirmed, in his mild, patient way. “Or we cut Jamie’s throat.”\n\nHe’d never liked Jamie all that much anyway.\n\nThat was Nick’s first thought. His second thought was that Alan did like Jamie, that Jamie made him laugh, and that there had always been more to Alan’s protectiveness of Jamie than a desire to impress Mae. Blond, sunny Jamie was probably Alan’s idea of a proper brother, a real one, the one he could’ve had if his mother had lived. Alan would want Jamie safe.\n\nBesides, Jamie was Mae’s brother. Nick found he did not want to think about how Mae would look if she learned that Nick had let her little brother die.\n\nNick would have preferred not to see Jamie die, given the choice, but he hadn’t been given a choice. It was not as if the magicians would let Jamie go if Nick put down his weapons. They would only kill Nick too, and then he would have committed a very noble and totally pointless suicide.\n\n“We won’t hurt you,” Gerald promised.\n\n“Oh, really? On your honor as murderous magicians?”\n\nLaura made a choked-off sound of surprise or indignation, but Gerald kept his eyes trained on Nick’s face.\n\n“Black Arthur doesn’t want you hurt. Do what we ask, and the boy won’t be hurt either.”\n\n“Gerald, this is ridiculous,” said Laura sharply.\n\nIt could be true, Nick thought. Even if Arthur had been hunting them for Mum’s charm all this time, he might not want Nick killed. He was Arthur’s son.\n\nHe could use that.\n\nIt was a risk, though. The magicians might just want two intact bodies for the demons to possess. Nick looked down at the reassuring gleam of his knife and then over at Jamie.\n\nLaura the magician had tight hold of Jamie, one hand in his hair, pulling his head back to bare his throat for her blade. The knife was so close to his skin that he could not even tremble in case he opened his veins against the edge. Jamie was keeping still, with his back arched taut as a bowstring and his eyes wide, scared and hopeless.\n\n“All right,” Nick said. “I’ll put down my weapons.”\n\nHe knelt and put down the knife, then unsheathed his sword and laid it the ground, looking warily up at Gerald as he did so, ready to snatch the sword back up if he made any sudden movements. Gerald just smiled like a king well-pleased with the tribute laid at his feet.\n\nHe rose slowly, and Gerald murmured, “All of the weapons, Nick.”\n\nNick snapped one knife from his wrist sheath and threw it down. Then he reached into his pocket for his switchblade, and drew that out too. Gerald’s gaze was fastened on him, watching every movement, and Nick regretted putting any of his weapons down. Anything would have been better than this slow, enforced stripping of Nick’s defenses under the eyes of the enemy.\n\nHe let the switchblade fall out of his open palm. He made sure that every weapon he dropped landed within easy reaching distance.\n\nHe left the knife in his boot and the knife fastened inside his belt and jeans, against his thigh, where they were. What Gerald didn’t know might end up hurting him, if they were lucky.\n\n“Now take three steps back,” Gerald said quietly.\n\nThat would put Nick across the threshold into the room where Anzu waited, and a safe distance away from the weapons. Nick checked over his shoulder and saw that three steps would not bring him anywhere near Anzu, waiting in his simmering flames.\n\nHe looked back at Gerald and nodded. He took three deliberate steps back.\n\nHe immediately felt the difference, a sudden sensation as if walls had slammed down all around him. Claustrophobia seized him, the feeling pressing on his chest and squeezing his lungs so he could only breathe in short, shallow pants. He looked around and saw that there was a circle of imprisonment chalked onto the floor around him.\n\nNick looked up sharply at Gerald and saw his eyes flash with triumph.\n\nHe wondered when magicians had learned how to trap a human in an imprisonment circle. This wasn’t one of those where you would die if you crossed the line; it did not even offer you that choice. Nick could feel the barriers in place. He risked it anyway, tried to step forward and simply could not do it, any more than he could have walked through a wall. This was a genuine imprisonment circle, and he was trapped inside as surely as Anzu was trapped inside his.\n\nInside his, Anzu was laughing.\n\nThe magician Laura had loosened her hold on Jamie. She had one arm looped casually around his neck, and it would have looked like a gesture of affection if she had not still been gripping the knife. Nick could see her properly now, a small middle-aged woman with an intelligent face. She looked surprised that Nick had put down his weapons, although not half as surprised as Jamie did.\n\n“How did you know it would work?” she asked Gerald.\n\n“I guessed,” Gerald replied, his voice as soft as ever, belying that hard, triumphant gaze. “I was assigned to watch them, remember? I wasn’t sure it would work, but I wanted to test my theory.”\n\nNick did not care what Gerald’s theory might be. He was busy calling himself a hundred kinds of fool for putting down the sword. It was becoming more and more obvious that they were outmatched. The magicians had tricks none of them were prepared for. The magicians had clearly planned this. Nick should have let Jamie be a casualty and got out of there. Jamie didn’t matter at all, not compared to what else Nick might lose.\n\nHe felt something colder and sharper than regret, turning in his belly as if he’d swallowed a needle, when he heard the footsteps coming down the stairs and down the corridor toward them.\n\nThere were at least four people, and one set of steps Nick knew by heart: fast as anyone’s step but with that slightly dragging foot. When the magicians came closer, he saw that one had a knife to Mae’s throat, and Alan’s hands were tied. The magicians had done just the same as they had with Nick and Jamie, targeting the weak one and using them as leverage. Of course it had worked on Alan, but it should not have worked on Nick.\n\nAlan looked at Nick. His eyes widened slightly when he saw the imprisonment circle. His gaze traveled from Nick to Jamie. Nick saw him putting together what must have happened and he wanted to say he was sorry but then, incredibly, Alan smiled.\n\nHis eyes were shining as he asked, “Are you all right?”\n\nNick nodded. It wasn’t a lie. He was going to be all right. He was going to get out of this circle, and he was going to kill every magician in this house. He looked at Alan, and Alan seemed all right too, wrists bound tightly but unmarked. After a moment he looked at Mae and saw that she, unlike Jamie, had clearly struggled. The knife must have just grazed her. Her throat was bloody but not bleeding too much, and she looked steady on her feet.\n\nNick kept cataloguing these details, all the while hollowly aware that he could see no way they were going to survive this.\n\n“Let’s all go inside and talk, shall we?” said Gerald, making an inviting gesture to the room of circles and pentagrams. “Black Arthur will be here soon.”\n\nHis eyes moved from Jamie to Mae to Alan, as if taking a survey, and then they turned to rest on Nick.\n\nGerald smiled and added, “He’s been waiting a long time to meet you.”\n\n14\n\nBlack Arthur\n\nTHE SOUNDS OF LONDON WERE COMING IN FROM AN OPEN window. Cars were purring mechanically down the streets, and the evening sunlight was cresting the tops of the tallest buildings, crowning them with gold. The rest of the city was in shadow, miles of uniform gray stretching out and interrupted by the glittering lines of rivers.\n\nIt might as well have been another world. In this room there was no sound but the hiss of fire in a demon’s circle and Gerald’s quiet, pleasant voice.\n\nThe rest of the Circle had filtered in by now. There were ten magicians in the room with them, far too many to fight. Alan, Jamie, and Mae were in a small knot, guarded by Laura and the other magician with the knife. Alan had unobtrusively placed himself between the others and the knives and he kept edging forward, trying to see Anzu, trying to see more of the room. The magicians fell back as he moved, which meant they did not want to kill him yet.\n\nNick could not move from the circle of imprisonment, but he absorbed all he could. The room was paneled and dim, all light coming from Anzu’s fire and lightbulbs in faux candlesticks attached to the walls. The room was large, and it looked even larger because of the circles and pentagrams and amulets forming a crazy pattern that tricked the eye. The chalked lines and deep shadows stretched Nick’s vision until the floor seemed about to tilt into another world.\n\nThere was nowhere to hide in this room. Even if Nick could get out of the circle, it would be pointless. They had to wait until there were fewer magicians, but there seemed no prospect of there being fewer magicians anytime soon. Everyone was gathered here expecting Black Arthur, the leader of them all.\n\nThat was bad news, of course, and yet Nick could still sense the singing, tugging feeling of the call of blood in his veins. His heartbeats were pounding to Black Arthur’s approaching footsteps and, evil or not, spell or not, he could not help it: He wanted to see his father.\n\nThen he looked at Alan, who had tasted his blood and who must be feeling the same things Nick felt, and as the door creaked open he saw Alan turn pale and sick with dread.\n\nHe wished his father a thousand miles away as Black Arthur came into the room.\n\nThe spell of blood to blood sang in Nick’s veins, as if there was a kettle somewhere bringing his blood to the boil. For a moment all he could hear was that singing victorious sound, and all he could feel was the tug of connection between himself and this man, the link formed of shared blood.\n\nIts purpose accomplished, the spell ended. The link snapped.\n\nIn the sudden silence, Nick found himself staring at his father. He felt the same thing he had felt since he found out the truth. He felt nothing.\n\nThere should have been at least some feeling of connection, Nick thought, but instead he was left staring at his father as he would have stared at the page of a book, trying to make sense of what he saw.\n\nBlack Arthur did not look as much like Nick as Nick had imagined he would.\n\nHe looked a lot like Mum, as if they had chosen each other because they wanted to see themselves in each other’s faces and not just their eyes. He looked enough like Nick that Nick could see the markers of shared blood he’d never been able to find in Alan’s face. They were clear on the face of this stranger.\n\nArthur was tall and pale and had black hair. He had Nick’s broad shoulders and his strong hands, but something about his muscles looked too sleek and civilized, as if he had built them up for display rather than earning them by fighting. He wore his black hair longer than Nick wore his, and unlike Nick’s, it was curly. The ends almost touched his shoulders, and the effect was that of a mane.\n\nHe had Nick’s flat cheekbones and his brutal, full mouth, but the one thing Nick had expected, Arthur did not have. He did not have Nick’s eyes.\n\nBlack Arthur had eyes an even paler blue than Mum’s. They were pale enough to remind Nick of that dying wolf’s eyes, so pale that even the blue looked like an illusion, a trick of the light cast on ice.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐau rát cổ họng triền miên?

He had the warm, easy voice of a leader, someone comfortable using words and through words, using people.\n\n“Well done, Gerald!” he said, giving due credit to his lieutenant, but he did not glance Gerald’s way.\n\nHis big, black-maned head was thrown back to survey his prize, and his wintry wolf’s eyes were fastened on Nick. They were shining with possessive pride.\n\nNick folded his arms across his chest and glared as Black Arthur prowled around the circle of imprisonment, eyes running over every detail of Nick’s face and body as if he was an art dealer examining a picture.\n\n“Say something,” Arthur commanded at last. “Anything.”\n\n“Let me and my brother go,” said Nick. “Or I’ll cut your heart out.”\n\nHe did not know how Arthur would react to that — whether he would be angry or laugh at the empty threat — but he did not expect Arthur to look delighted. He had the air of a man whose dog had just done a wonderful trick.\n\nArthur opened his mouth, but Nick never found out what he was going to say, because the moment before he spoke there was a rap at the door.\n\n“Come in,” Arthur said irritably.\n\n“Sir, I’m not sure—” said a voice near the door, but the door swung open amid the sound of protests.\n\nMum stood in the doorway.\n\nThere was a magician behind her, but it was hard to notice anything but Mum. She had her eyes fixed on Black Arthur and her face was white, white as a flame that was burning hot as a star.\n\nNick cursed softly. Alan looked wild with panic.\n\nArthur said, “Livia!” and held out his hands, and without a moment’s hesitation Mum walked toward him and took both his hands in hers.\n\nHe stood with his head bowed down to hers, their black hair mingling, and they looked like brother and sister in each other’s arms, like twins. Nick saw in that moment how they must have been together, before he was born: two magicians who did not care about anything but themselves and each other, beautiful and brilliant and cruel. Mum’s face looked older than Arthur’s now, marked by lines of care and pain, but there was nothing on her face that looked anything like fear.\n\n“Arthur,” she said, running her fingers through his hair. Nick had never seen Mum show affection like that to anyone.\n\nArthur smiled down at her. “I knew you would come back to me one day,” he said. “I knew it.” He paused, and when Mum kept her silence, Arthur said, “You have come back to me, Livia, haven’t you?”\n\n“Yes,” Mum said slowly. “Yes, I have.”\n\n“You’ve forgiven me,” Arthur prompted her, as a stage director to an actress who seemed to have forgotten her lines.\n\nMum looked at him for a long time. “No,” she said. “No, I haven’t forgiven you.”\n\nArthur caught her hands in his again, pressing them as if Mum’s were cold. “But you will,” he said confidently. “Everything’s all right now. It’s all turned out exactly as I told you it would. You should never have run, Livia. You should have known you couldn’t change anything.”\n\n“I always knew this would happen,” Mum said. “I used to sit alone in a hundred different rooms and think of how it would be, standing face-to-face with you again. And then I heard the children talking about going to find magicians — and I knew the day had finally come.”\n\nArthur laughed. “You never loved him?”\n\n“Who?” Mum asked. “Daniel? No, but he was very kind to me. I owe him something. He tried. No man ever tried as hard as he did.”\n\nHer gaze moved for the first time away from Arthur’s face, traveling in an unconcerned way from the paneled wall to the demon in his flames, until she found Alan. Alan stood there with magicians around him and his hands tied, his face a na**d plea. Mum’s expression did not change.\n\nNick was not surprised that Mum never looked at him.\n\n“He tried to interfere,” said Arthur. “He failed, and you were always mine. Forgive me, Livia. You’ll see that it was worth it. I will give you anything in the world.”\n\n“Give me just one thing,” Mum said, smiling into his eyes. “And I’ll forgive you.”\n\n“Anything,” Arthur told her, and kissed the top of her head, tucking her against him. They looked as if they were posing for a picture of the perfect couple.\n\nNick said loudly, “I have a question.”\n\nMum did not look at him even then. She was doing her trick of pretending not to know Nick was in the room, even though her whole body was tense with awareness of him. She had her eyes turned away, and he could see her schooling her face into blankness in case he spoke to her.\n\nArthur’s gaze fell on Nick and absorbed him to the exclusion of all the world.\n\n“Of course,” he said. “You only have to ask.”\n\n“Are you—” Nick said, and did not look at Alan. “Aren’t you going to take her charm?”\n\nArthur reached to touch Mum’s neck, and metal links slipped like sand through his fingers, one chain followed by another, as if he was telling rosary beads. Magic symbols gleamed against his large, capable hands, hands Nick had inherited from him, hands with the strength to kill. At last there was only one charm left, lying cupped in his palm. It was a simple silver disc with a black symbol carved onto it.\n\n“This one?” Arthur inquired. The chain was taut in his hand. If he closed his fingers around it and pulled, it would snap in an instant.\n\n“I guess so,” said Nick, not daring to look at Alan. “That one. Don’t you want it?”\n\nArthur lifted the chain and dropped a kiss on the symbol, then let the charm fall back to Mum’s breast. “I want her to have it,” he said mildly. “It is keeping her alive.”\n\nNick strode forward in a fury and then found himself pulled up short by the confines of the imprisonment circle. It was like being a savage dog kept on a chain so he would not fly at throats. He felt like flying at throats. He made a sound that was almost a snarl.\n\n“If you didn’t want the charm, why were we hunted all over the country?” he demanded. “What did you want? Was it her? You killed Dad because you couldn’t find yourself a different girlfriend?”\n\nThere was a stir around the room. There was Anzu laughing quietly at the spectacle of Nick, unable to escape the circle. Some of the magicians had actually drawn back when Nick moved, and now Alan was standing at the front of their little group.\n\nAlan had not moved. The gray, worn look of dread on his face had not changed.\n\n“I love Livia,” Arthur said calmly. “But you wouldn’t be able to understand that, now would you?”\n\nHe let go of Mum, left her standing by herself and staring almost thoughtfully out the window. She made no move to stop him leaving, just lifted her hand to her charms and began to thread them through her fingers, telling them as he had moments before, as if she were praying.\n\nBlack Arthur walked toward Nick, coming so close that his shoes almost touched the outside of Nick’s circular chalked prison. They stood face-to-face, Nick only a shade smaller than Arthur, their eyes almost on a level. Nick knew they were father and son, but he felt as if Arthur was a spectator at the zoo, and he was a tiger in a cage. Arthur looked at him with gentle interest, and Nick only just stopped himself from snarling again.\n\n“We weren’t hunting Livia,” Arthur said softly. “This was never about Livia. This was never about a charm. Who’s been telling you lies?”\n\nNick looked at Alan and kept his mouth shut.\n\nArthur went on, his voice soft and smooth, as if with words alone he could reach through cage bars and stroke a tiger into tameness. “You wouldn’t understand lies, obviously.”\n\n“You assume a lot about me for someone who just met me today,” Nick observed coldly.\n\nArthur smiled at him, a private and particular smile, as if he was about to let Nick and only Nick in on a joke.\n\n“Hunted all over the country,” he said, repeating Nick’s words with an echo of Nick’s flat inflection. “Not just the Obsidian Circle, but every magicians’ Circle in England went hunting. Do you know what they wanted?”\n\nHis father was close but not close enough to kill, and they were all in danger. The sense of being trapped was worse than anything. No matter what came, Nick could not fight. He could not even run.\n\n“Do you want to tell me?” Nick asked in a rough voice. “While I’m young?”\n\nArthur smiled again, almost fondly. “They wanted you,” he murmured. “Just you.”\n\nNick’s mind raced. He didn’t know how much other magicians might have wanted Arthur’s son as leverage. He didn’t know what he meant to Black Arthur.\n\nThe intensity of Black Arthur’s gaze made Nick think that he must mean something.\n\n“You don’t know how often my magicians have watched you,” Black Arthur said. “I know so much about you, so much you don’t know. So much you need to know. After all, you thought the Obsidian Circle were causing all the little incidents in your house, didn’t you?”\n\nNick nodded guardedly, waiting for Arthur to drop a hint.\n\n“There was the car that dropped in your garage,” Arthur reminded him. “There were all those strange things happening in your house, glasses breaking and lights going out. Why would we do any of that? Didn’t it ever occur to you that your house was flooded with magic for the week when you were not wearing your talisman?”\n\nNick remembered the lights going out so he could be left in the dark with Mae. He distanced himself from the memory so he could view it at a remove, so he could think about what he had done and what he’d meant to do.\n\nHe had been angry before those glasses broke. He had been angry before the car fell. He had been angry, and the world had started falling apart around him.\n\nAfter all, what did it matter? He had suspected he was a magician already. Now he knew why Arthur had wanted to find him, and perhaps why the other Circles had wanted to get him first.\n\n“No,” Nick said, “it never occurred to me — but it makes sense.”\n\n“All the other Circles wanted you,” Arthur murmured to him, “but you’re mine. My greatest achievement. Do you want to know why?”\n\n“Yeah,” Nick said. “I’d like you to explain your entire evil plot in detail. Don’t forget the bit where you tell me your one weakness.”\n\nBlack Arthur laughed. “We’re not enemies. I’m going to explain all of this to you, and then you’ll understand. We’re going to be partners, and I, unlike some people—” He spared Alan a dismissive glance and then leaned forward, all his attention on Nick. “I will never lie to you.”\n\nHis eyes looked as pale as the demon Liannan’s and almost as hypnotic. Nick could feel Arthur’s breath on his face.\n\n“Nicholas,” said Black Arthur. “I’m going to tell you everything.”\n\n“Don’t bother,” Nick said. “I already know everything. Thanks.”\n\nArthur’s words, Arthur’s caressing and commanding voice, seemed to indicate that Nick, or at least the prospect of a magical heir, was worth a lot to him. There was something a shade off about him, though, something a little too detached about his perfect act, that made Nick doubt everything his eyes and ears told him.\n\nMaybe it was the fact he was still trapped in a magical circle that made him doubt Daddy’s affection.\n\n“Do you?” Arthur asked, and his glacier-colored eyes went to Alan. “Who told you? Did you tell it, Alan?”\n\nNick spoke loudly, to wrench Black Arthur’s attention away from Alan. “It doesn’t matter who told me! Tell me what you want.”\n\nBlack Arthur smiled. “Oh, I want everything,” he said. “Don’t you realize how much power you have?” he continued softly. “Don’t you realize what you are — what you could be?”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nThiếu nữ giảm cân siêu tốc với mẹo khó tin này! 2kg mỡ/ ngày\nSleepatnightandslim\nGiảm cân họ phạm giúp thổi bay 5-7kg tại nhà chỉ sau vài tuần.\nDongytaybac"

Stop playing games. I know that Alan isn’t my brother. I know what you’re capable of, and I know what I’m capable of. I know who I am.” He took a deep breath. “I know you’re my father.”\n\nThere was a long silence. Everyone had drawn in their breath, and there was nothing in the room but dead air. Nick could not look away from Arthur’s face. Black Arthur looked surprised, but after a moment he threw back his head and laughed.\n\n“That’s what you know?” he asked. “And why would it matter to you who the father is?”\n\nNick stared. “What?”\n\n“Why would you care who the father of the body is?” Arthur asked, eyes glittering and lingering on Nick’s face. “What does it matter? The body’s just a puppet. Don’t tell me you haven’t felt it.”\n\nThe room was all shadows as the sun began its long descent, the windows full of grayness. Nick felt for an instant as if they were poised on the brink of a much colder world and perhaps had already started to fall. He looked at his hands in the slanting yellow rays shed by the lamps and saw the chalked lines of the circle below. He remembered the House of Mezentius, and a possessed man trapped in a circle just like this one.\n\n“You are a demon I called into my son,” murmured Black Arthur. “You never had a father or a brother. You never had a heart.”\n\nHis gaze stroked possessively up and down Nick, and Nick finally understood why Black Arthur looked at him the way he did. He was not staring at a son. He was staring at an object, one that he had created and wanted to use.\n\nNick knew what he meant to Black Arthur now.\n\nArthur smiled again, slow, brilliant, and terribly amused.\n\n“Did you really think you were human?”\n\n15\n\nNothing Human\n\n“I — YOU’RE LYING,” NICK SAID. “YOU’RE LYING. DEMONS CAN’T live in the world that long. The bodies don’t last.”\n\nThere was a clock somewhere in this room, cutting time to pieces with a sharp knife. Nick hadn’t heard it before, hadn’t been aware of time passing until now. He needed Arthur to speak immediately and tell him that it was all a lie.\n\n“Of course that’s true,” Arthur said thoughtfully. “That was always the problem. You give a body to a demon and a few weeks later, it’s all worn out and you’re back exactly where you started. I found that most annoying and so, of course, did the demons.”\n\nThe demons, thought Nick, and looked over at Anzu. Anzu was already looking at him with a mocking smile, dark wings outlined against the flame. He was a sinister figure, even in this room full of magic, and Nick stared into his night-dark eyes and knew it could not be true.\n\nThen he wondered why Anzu had black eyes, when usually demons had eyes that were water-clear. Demons had black eyes only when they were possessing human bodies. Thomas in the House of Mezentius, and the dead woman in this house, both had black eyes. Nick knew that the possessed had black eyes, had always known that, and he had looked into the mirror a thousand times and never put it together.\n\nAnzu’s eyes were a message.\n\nNick looked at his father’s eyes, and then looked at his mother’s, and saw nothing but blue, blue, blue. Nick’s own eyes were an endless, cold black.\n\n“The problem with the bodies was that the souls were always in there fighting. The soul and the demon tear the body to pieces, like two dogs fighting over the same bone,” Arthur said. “I knew there had to be a way around that. Have you ever heard the superstition that a child’s soul enters its body with its first breath?”\n\nNick looked away from him and found he could not look at Alan. He looked at Mae and Jamie instead, standing behind Alan, and saw that Mae’s face wore an expression of horrified disbelief. When she met Nick’s eyes, she flinched.\n\nJamie looked upset, but he did not look surprised. Nick recalled Jamie saying that Nick reminded him of someone. Of course. He should have remembered that Jamie had looked into a demon’s face before.\n\nHe wrenched his eyes away.\n\n“The demons only grant us so much power because we can only grant them so much time in this world,” Arthur went on, as if telling his son a bedtime story. “I knew that if I could give a demon a lifetime, the power I received would be unimaginable. I knew it was worth any sacrifice.”\n\nNick’s mother, the sacrifice, seemed unmoved. She was still staring at the floor and playing with her charms. Nick was surprised to see a shimmer of power running through the chains.\n\n“I started to collect pregnant women,” Arthur said calmly. “I had them taken and kept here, but you cannot understand how difficult it is to open a way from the demon world inside a woman’s body. Too many of the women became possessed and died. I had to invent a charm to keep them safe from possession.”\n\nMum twirled the charm Arthur had kissed around one finger, and this time Nick saw a symbol on the silver disc as it whirled and caught the light. It was the symbol of a circle with a line straight through it, the meaning clear. It marked Mum as forbidden territory to the demons.\n\n“The women kept dying,” Arthur said. “Opening their bodies to the demon world gave them terrible dreams. They went mad. They got sick. None of them survived to give birth. It was then that Livia became pregnant, and I realized what I had to do. I knew how strong she was.”\n\nNick remembered the days when Mum screamed all the time, her eyes fixed on something far away, something nobody else could see. He knew every line of pain on Mum’s face, and now he knew what had caused them.\n\n“At first Livia did not realize what was happening, and when she did, she was…rather distressed. But I knew I couldn’t stop. I knew what was at stake. I kept on, and Livia survived, and then on one long day of blood and madness, you came into this world. You were a beautiful baby,” Arthur said, and his smile flashed again as if all this was irresistibly funny. “You had blank black demon’s eyes, and you never cried. You never made a sound.”\n\nIt was a straw to a drowning man. Even when he grabbed it, breathless and desperate, he knew it would not save him.\n\n“That’s right,” Nick said. “Dem£aids aons don’t — they don’t talk. I can talk.”\n\n“I know,” Arthur breathed. “I couldn’t believe it when Gerald told me. I think that’s amazing.”\n\n“It’s not amazing,” Nick bit out. “It’s not true. I can talk, so it’s not true.”\n\n“Do you find words difficult?” Arthur asked. “I can’t imagine that you’re any good at reading or writing, and as for lying — Words are so alien to your kind. They can’t come easily to you.”\n\nNick remembered the night he had come back from Natasha’s house to confront Alan and had been confronted by Mae. He had tried to talk and nothing had come out but hoarse croaking, a sound that could never have been language, that did not belong in a human throat.\n\n“Do you know what you remind me of? There are children in this world brought up by animals. There were once two girls brought up by wolves, who thought they were wolves. They howled and they walked on four legs and when people captured them, for a long time they were unable to speak. A baby’s mind is a small, blank thing, and too impressionable. You couldn’t remember what you were; the baby mind was too limited. And then as you grew, the same mind was flexible enough, young enough, to actually take in human speech. The wild girls could howl, but that didn’t make them wolves. And you can speak, but that doesn’t make you human.” Arthur’s voice was almost tender. “Nothing can make you human.”\n\nNick thought about animals. They had never liked him. Even Alan’s kitten had bitten him. The animals had known.\n\nThen he thought of the boat, and the way he had felt as soon as he had walked onto it: as if his body did not belong to him. He should have remembered that running water was meant to keep the body safe from demons. He should have known.\n\n“I understand that this is difficult for you. It’s a lot to grasp all at once. I knew you wouldn’t remember everything when you were put in the child’s mind. I meant to bring you up and tell you everything. I meant you to be aware of your power. I meant us to have the world, but — well.” Arthur shrugged. “Livia was strange, after you were born. She was so quiet, I thought — we all thought her mind had broken. We thought she was neutralized. We left her alone with you, and one day she was gone. She took you from where you belonged, and then that man and his son tried to take from you what you are.”\n\nNick opened his mouth and then shut it. He was suddenly and desperately unsure of what would happen if he tried to speak.\n\nArthur smiled. “They all failed. You’re here now, and you’re mine. I made you. What do you think you owe me for that?”\n\nNick swallowed. There seemed to be barbed wire in his throat, and he thought that if he spoke, the words would come out mangled and torn.\n\nIf he didn’t speak, Arthur would win. He would just be a demon standing imprisoned in his circle, silently waiting for his magician’s command. He had to say something.\n\n“Nothing,” said Nick, and was surprised to hear his own voice. “I owe you nothing,” he continued, and actually listened to his voice, flat and cold as a sheet of ice. He did not sound human. “I owe you nothing,” he insisted. “Because I don’t believe you.”\n\nA car horn screamed outside in a long cry for help that went unanswered.\n\n“That reminds me,” said Arthur. “Those girls who thought they were wolves? They had a mother. The people who found the den had to shoot the wolf before they could get at the girls. An animal might make that sort of mistake, but a human should know his own kind!” He raised his voice. “Wouldn’t you agree, Alan?”\n\nAlan lifted his head. The last color had drained away from his face, leaving it a terrible stony white. His eyes were dark with fury, so dark that they looked almost black.\n\n“Bring him to me,” ordered Black Arthur, and then turned back to Nick. “If you won’t believe me,” he said, “will you believe him?”\n\nThe male magician with the knife seized hold of the ropes binding Alan’s wrists and practically threw him in front of Arthur, with enough force that Alan stumbled and had to put his weight on his bad leg to keep himself upright. Nick saw his teeth sink into his lower lip, but he didn’t make a sound.\n\n“Alan,” Arthur said in the tone of a warm, welcoming host. “I think I’ve worked out all that happened once Livia ran, but I’d be very interested to get an insider’s point of view. Go on, don’t be shy.”\n\nAlan tilted his chin up to meet the magician’s eyes.\n\n“Go to hell,” he said, and spat in Arthur’s face.\n\nThere was instant chaos. Every magician but Gerald moved forward or spoke angrily. Mae shouted Alan’s name, and the magician holding her thrust the knife back up to her throat. Black Arthur lifted a fist with magical fire sizzling inside it, and Mum lunged forward and caught his wrist.\n\n“Arthur, no! He’s a stupid boy. He’s lonely and desperate, and he got fond of it. He had nothing else. Don’t hurt him.”\n\nArthur lowered his fist, and Nick slowly unclenched his own. Arthur made a small gesture and his face was clean and smiling once more. He stepped into Alan’s space, and Nick looked at the breadth of Arthur’s shoulders. He was even bigger than Nick; he could snap Alan in two.\n\nHe was a magician. He could do a lot worse than that.\n\n“Alan,” Nick said, and on that name of all the words in the world, his voice cracked and emerged as a guttural, inhuman croak. He swallowed and forced out, “I want to know. Please.”\n\nAlan’s mouth twisted. “It’s true,” he whispered. “I’m sorry.”\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nThiếu nữ giảm cân siêu tốc với mẹo khó tin này! 2kg mỡ/ ngày\nSleepatnightandslim\nGiảm cân họ phạm giúp thổi bay 5-7kg tại nhà chỉ sau vài tuần.\nDongytaybac"

It meant he was crying. The sky outside was such a dark gray that Nick knew there was a storm coming with the night, and no light could filter through the clouds. The lamplight caught the tears clinging to Alan’s eyelashes and painted the tears running down his face yellow.\n\nNick reached out, but the circle stopped him. He let his hand fall; he didn’t know what he could have done, anyway.\n\nArthur reached up a careless hand, bearing a large, elaborately carved silver ring, and wiped a thumb over Alan’s cheek, chasing away a tear. That was another thing Nick had never been good at, another way Nick had never been human. He was not good at touching.\n\nAlan turned his face away.\n\n“Don’t touch me,” he said in a muted voice.\n\n“You were very young when it came. Can you tell me what happened?” Arthur asked, as if he had a right to ask, as if he was a grown-up who had come to save Alan from all this. “Can you tell me how it learned to talk?”\n\nAlan glanced over at Nick. “Do you want me to say?”\n\nNick nodded, and Black Arthur laughed.\n\n“Of course it does,” he said. “What does it know about mercy? It will take from you until you have nothing left. That’s what demons are. That’s what they do.”\n\nAlan turned his face away from Arthur again, toward Nick, but he didn’t seem able to look at Nick. He looked at the floor.\n\n“Olivia came to us hoping that somehow we would be able to do something for the baby. Only we couldn’t, of course. And when she realized there was nothing we could do, when she—” Alan shook his head, unable to wipe away the tears with his tied hands. “Dad and I went to our first Goblin Market. I thought it was exciting, I came home laughing, and—”\n\n“And what, Alan?”\n\nAlan’s voice was very low. “Olivia was in the bathroom, with — with the baby. She was trying to drown him. Only the baby wasn’t drowning. The water was boiling, and Olivia was screaming, her hands were getting burned, and my father had to fight her to get the baby. They were both screaming, and when Dad got the baby out, he wasn’t burned at all, and he’d never made a sound. Olivia wouldn’t stop screaming. Dad had to stay with her, he had to calm her down. He had to get the baby out of her sight. So he — he gave me the baby. He said that I had to be the one to take care of him now.”\n\n“And what did you do then?”\n\n“I did my best,” said Alan, his voice raw.\n\nNick had always known that Alan had practically raised him because Dad needed to look after Mum. He had not pictured it like this. Not Alan, small and trapped in a mad world, as a man and a woman wrestled in boiling water and a demon baby was put into his arms.\n\nNick had a memory dim enough to be imagination of himself in a little bed, with Alan leaning solemnly out of the darkness, singing something: gibberish. Human words. In the memory Alan’s small face looked worried and fond; Nick had seen that expression on his face a thousand times and had never wondered what Alan saw when he looked at Nick.\n\nTurning away from Alan’s tears, Nick finally located the clock. It was standing in the shadows behind Anzu’s balefire. He saw his own pale face flash for an instant in the fire-lit glass of the clock face, reflection curved in the shape of a scythe.\n\nEven the firelight could not warm those black eyes. The face was made like a man’s, but it showed no more feeling than a mask, looked no more human than a doll.\n\nThey had given that to a child. To Alan.\n\n“So it was you who taught it to speak?” Arthur asked, with what seemed to be genuine curiosity. “How did you do that?”\n\nAlan’s face was still averted from Black Arthur, but he did answer him. “I’m not sure. I just — He was my responsibility. I talked to him. I read to him. I took him for walks and pointed things out to him, I told him their names. He started to speak when he was four, and I was so happy. I tried — I tried to raise him right.”\n\n“No,” said Arthur, in the patient tones of a teacher. “You tried to raise it human.”\n\nAlan did not answer Arthur this time. He just kept talking, his voice serious. It reminded Nick of the way he used to tell bedtime stories. “Once he started to speak, Dad started to think — Dad thought there was hope. He tried to teach Nick things, tried to tell him how to behave. The last thing he said before you killed him was that I should look after Nick, and I’ve done my best.”\n\nArthur sounded truly puzzled. “Why did you even try? Do you think you actually mean something to it?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Alan snapped. “How could I know? That’s not the point. He means something to me. I never wanted him—” He made an effort to lift his eyes to Nick’s face. The effort did not succeed, but Alan’s next words were directed at him. “I never wanted you to know any of this.”\n\n“Why not?” asked Black Arthur, and he looked amused again. “Did you think it would be upset?” He shoved Alan backward a little, turned his head, and grinned at Nick. “Are you upset? What do you feel?”\n\nNick stared at his wintry eyes, at his handsome, smiling face. This wasn’t Nick’s father. He’d never had a father. Demons didn’t have fathers. Demons didn’t have families. They existed forever, unchanging, in a bleak gray landscape like the endless distance between Nick and all feeling over these past few days.\n\n“Not much,” said Nick.\n\nArthur smiled the smile of a man who had guessed right.\n\n“You never did feel much, did you?” he inquired softly. “You always thought half the things the humans did were mystifying and stupid. You didn’t want to save people like Alan did. You didn’t want to get close to people. You don’t even understand what love is. Do you? Human love. Do you know what it is?”\n\n“No,” Nick said quietly.\n\n“Do you know anything about it?”\n\n“I don’t,” Nick said, and swallowed. “I don’t know.”\n\nArthur’s voice went even softer, though the softness was too smooth and easy to be kind. “It’s all right now. You’re free. You don’t ever have to pretend to be one of us again. You know the truth, and you know your own power. You know how it works: At sixteen, the body can control the demon magic. You turned sixteen, and I sent a messenger to find you. I promised you I would stop at nothing to get you back, and here you are. Where you were always meant to be.”\n\nIf Arthur was so concerned about him, it was funny he hadn’t put forth his best efforts until the time came when Nick could be useful.\n\nNick thought of the messenger telling them, Black Arthur says that now’s the time. He wants it back.\n\nIt. Nick. The charm Mum had worn had just been another lie, and the look on Alan’s face when that messenger came had not been fear for Mum. He hadn’t been plotting and lying to shield Mum.\n\nNick ventured a glance at Alan, but Alan’s face was still turned away.\n\nBlack Arthur was still talking. “You have what no other demon has ever had: a body of your own. You can do anything you want.”\n\nNick wasn’t sure he wanted anything. He just felt cold.\n\n“I gave you the world,” Arthur said. “And now you can give me the world — or enough power to swallow up all the other Circles, to become the most powerful magician in the world. That’s all I want, and I think that’s fair, don’t you?”\n\nNick cleared his throat. “Why should I?”\n\n“We made a bargain when I gave you this body, and now I’ve explained that I expect you to keep it. You gave me your word.”\n\nHad he given his word? He couldn’t remember that, couldn’t remember any of it, but he did remember Alan’s voice saying that the demons would do anything to escape their world.\n\nHe looked at Black Arthur’s face, his hungry wolf’s eyes, and believed him. He had made a bargain.\n\nBlood was pounding in Nick’s temples. He looked again at that icy reflection in the clock face and then down at his big hands. He had been right, he thought, looking at the curve of his fingers by firelight as if they belonged to someone else. Black Arthur had given him these hands, that face, and every drop of blood in his veins. Arthur only wanted what he was owed: what Nick had promised him.\n\nHe hadn’t promised him Alan. Black Arthur had no right to touch his brother.\n\n“My word?” Nick said. “I have words of my own now? I thought Alan gave me all of them. You asked me what I felt. I don’t feel like giving you a thing.”\n\nArthur shrugged. “I suppose it would be too much to expect gratitude from a demon. You force me to remind you that you have stepped into a magic circle. If you ever want to get out, you need to cooperate. Come, now. What does it matter to you? You can give me what I want without even trying. You owe me, and I wish to collect, but I won’t be your master. I told you this was a partnership. I contributed the body of my son, and now you will contribute the power, and together we will be able to do anything. We will be able to have anything.”\n\nNick did not want to be trapped here for the rest of his life. He wondered exactly how much power Arthur wanted, and how he was supposed to give it to him. He suspected that a lot of people would be cut down in Black Arthur’s progress toward power. He wondered if that should matter to him.\n\nThe air of the room seemed heavy with the weight of all these expectations. Black Arthur was watching him. All the magicians were watching him. All but one.\n\nMum’s voice shattered the tense silence, light and easy, as if she was about to sing.\n\n“What about me?”\n\nArthur looked vaguely startled. Nick thought he might have forgotten she was there. “Livia,” he said, turning his head. “You’ll be with me. I will give you anything.”\n\n“I told you,” Mum said, smiling suddenly. “I only want one thing.”\n\nShe had her hands clasped to her breast, like a little girl hiding a secret from her elders. Nick remembered that she had been playing with her charms before. He knew that small, mad smile. He was not surprised when she opened her cupped palms a little, and they all saw the shimmer rising from her charms. Mum walked towards Arthur with her fingertips wreathed in gold and blue.\n\n“Yes?” Arthur asked.\n\nMum was still smiling when she reached Arthur, and she let her charms fall blazing against her chest. She reached up and threaded her fire-ringed fingers through Arthur’s hair in the same tender gesture she had used before. Arthur was smiling back at her a little; she cupped his face in her hands.\n\n“Arthur,” she murmured.\n\n“Yes, my darling?”\n\n“Give me back my child,” whispered Mum.\n\nShe caught Arthur’s mouth in a kiss. She was holding him close when she burst into flame.\n\n16\n\nExorcism\n\n“OLIVIA!” MAE SCREAMED, FAR TOO LATE.\n\nThe room was suddenly a space confining a riot. Some magicians were rushing to help their leader, throwing out water charms and damping spells into the air. Some magicians, like Gerald, were moving unobtrusively toward the back of the room.\n\nWhen Mae moved, Nick thought the knife at her throat would cut it, but Jamie looked at Mae and made a desperate effort.\n\nThe knife at Jamie’s throat never moved. The knife at Mae’s throat went flying. Mae slammed an elbow into the man’s stomach and hit his chin with the top of her head. When he let her go, she threw herself at him, and they both went crashing to the ground. The magician holding Jamie moved to help him and Jamie stepped swiftly away. They stood staring warily at each other, eyes locked. The magician twisted under Mae, fingers scrabbling for his knife, but Mae snatched her own knife, the knife Nick had given her, out of her pocket and held the blade to his throat.\n\nNick heard her pant, “Don’t move.”\n\nFrom the corner of his eye he saw Alan move, and he turned away from Mae. Alan was taking advantage of the chaos to pop one of his wrists out of alignment, grimacing as he did so, and slip his bonds. He bent his wrist back into place, glanced at Mae, at Mum, and finally at Nick, and then raced for the door. The door slammed shut, and Alan was gone before Nick could blink.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nĐánh bay u nhú xấu xí cấp tốc để tự tin vi vu hè 2019\nThiếu nữ giảm cân siêu tốc với mẹo khó tin này! 2kg mỡ/ ngày\nSleepatnightandslim"

Triệt tiêu ngay\n\nNick could not move. He could do nothing but watch, and he watched Mum burn.\n\nThere was a fire now to rival Anzu’s, and this fire was real. Nick could feel the heat of it, could smell Mum’s burning clothes and hair and flesh. Arthur was screaming, trying to break free of her embrace, throwing up shielding spells, and still enveloped in flames. Nick saw his pale face remain untouched in the center of the fire, while his black hair became a streaming torch. Mum put up no defenses. She did not even scream. She just burned, skin crackling and going black, hair a sheet of flame. Nick knew she was alive only because the fire was still going, backed up by more power than he had ever dreamed she still possessed, burning with the rage and hate Mum had been saving for fifteen years. Arthur’s voice was an inarticulate roar, and the water spells were bouncing off them. For a moment Nick thought that Mum was actually going to succeed.\n\nThen she tumbled against Arthur’s chest, the kiss broken, her body reduced to charred skin and bones. Arthur gasped for clean air, his clothes and hair hanging in blackened remnants.\n\nMae shouted, “Jamie, come here!”\n\nShe positioned the knife point above the magician’s chest, over the heart, and then hesitated. Nick remembered what he’d told her last night: Across the throat or under the ribs for a killing blow.\n\nThe magician tried to buck Mae off but she hung on, set her teeth, and slid the knife in under his ribs. Blood flowed out around the knife, spreading across the man’s shirt, and Jamie went white.\n\n“Mae,” he said. “No—”\n\nMae was panting, her breaths coming out like sobs. “Jamie,” she said, her voice wavering. “Come here.”\n\nJamie stumbled forward, and Mae closed her hand around the knife blade. Then she reached up to Jamie, still making those sounds between breaths and sobs, and lifted his shirt. She left a bloody handprint on her brother’s hip, over his demon’s mark. For a moment the mark could still be seen, black under the smudgy red print, and then the lines blurred, turning into a gray shadow, and the mark was lost beneath a magician’s blood.\n\nLaura the magician grabbed Mae by her hair, wrenching her up and away from the fallen magician, and swinging her knife down in a vicious arc aimed for Mae’s throat.\n\n“No!” Gerald commanded. He took Jamie gently by the shoulders and pulled him back a step. “Don’t hurt her.”\n\n“She just murdered Rufus!” Laura exclaimed.\n\n“She might be useful,” said Gerald. “Leave her alone.”\n\nLaura looked mutinous for a moment, but she contented herself with pressing the blade of her knife hard against Mae’s already-grazed throat. Mae stayed still, her eyes closed and her face turned away from them all toward the window.\n\n“Do you know why Gerald wants them spared?” Arthur asked, his voice harsh from inhaling smoke and perhaps from something else, something as strange and human as grief.\n\nNick looked at him, which meant looking at his mother. She was on the floor now, so much discarded rubbish, and Arthur was approaching Nick with glittering, furious eyes. Even as he walked, his burned hair was growing, writhing like so many black and silver snakes. His shirt was wrapping itself around him, the charred shreds twining like lovers.\n\n“Maybe he likes the look of Mae,” Nick drawled.\n\n“Don’t be ridiculous.”\n\nNick raised his eyebrows. “Does he like the look of Jamie?”\n\n“He thinks that we might be able to use them as bargaining chips,” Arthur snarled. “He thinks that you might prefer them alive. I think Gerald’s young, and he’s being naive. I also think that you’ll do what I say without more bargaining. I sold my wife for this; I sold my son, and I will have what I paid for! Do you know how many demons would give anything to be in your place?”\n\nThere was a strange sound as Arthur spoke. Starting low, and then rising above the hiss of his balefire, was the sibilant sound of Anzu laughing.\n\n“Oh yes, anything,” Anzu said. “Who wouldn’t want to be trapped in a pathetic little human mind, unable to remember who they were? Especially since it went so well this time. How many demons volunteered to be put into a squalling brat, Arthur? There was only Hnikarr, and he was always reckless and stupid. Even he almost didn’t do it. Liannan advised against it from the start.”\n\n“Liannan,” Nick echoed.\n\nHe remembered her cold kiss and her trembling mouth. She had told him that she had known him once, a hundred years ago or more.\n\nShe had told him not to trust Anzu.\n\n“You don’t remember her, do you?” Anzu asked, lips curling and wings forming an almost sardonic curve above his head. “You don’t remember me, either. Of course, we knew you wouldn’t, but Arthur promised he would remind you of us and our claims. I suppose it slipped his mind.”\n\n“What claims?”\n\n“Do you think, Hnikarr,” Anzu said, black eyes on his, “that we would ever have trusted a magician with one of our own? You, me, and Liannan…we had an alliance. We agreed to your crazy plan, we knew you would be helpless as a child in this world if the magicians failed you. You promised us bodies, and we bound ourselves in service to you. For years you’ve been calling us up, treating us like slaves, playing the human and remembering nothing! Now you know everything, old friend. When will you be paying your debt?”\n\nIt had always been so easy for Nick to call his demons.\n\nAnzu had said the word “friend,” but that did not tally with the frosty snap at the end of every word he spoke. He was not looking at Nick like a friend.\n\n“You shouldn’t have marked my brother,” Nick said slowly.\n\n“How did I know you’d say something like that?” Anzu snarled. “You’re disgusting. Of course I marked him. I am going to kill him. We are demons. That is what we do! If you don’t understand that, there’s at least one thing that hasn’t changed. You were always a fool.”\n\n“Shut up,” Arthur commanded.\n\n“And you’re a fool too,” Anzu said. “Do you have any idea what a demon is? Do you really think, even for escape, we would exchange everything we know, everything we’ve learned over the centuries, to become a crawling creature like that one?”\n\nHe spat in Nick’s direction, a fat spark bursting from his beak and sputtering out at the edge of his circle.\n\n“You humans barely live long enough to know you’re going to die! Any of us would rather go on living where we are, snatching escape in a crumbling body, than give up who we are. You’d better come to some arrangement with Hnikarr. The rest of us have all seen what he’s become. Nobody will have anything to do with your marvelous bargain.”\n\nNick looked at Anzu, dark-winged in his fiery circle, and thought of a hundred questions to ask him, about the demon world, about Liannan. About what he had meant to Liannan and what he had meant to Anzu.\n\nAnzu’s face was filled with malevolent amusement. He’d find it funny, not answering Nick’s questions. Besides, even if Anzu had wanted to tell him, Nick suspected he would not be able to. He would not understand what Nick meant if he asked what a demon was.\n\nNick should know what a demon was. He should know what he was.\n\n“I didn’t know you two were acquainted,” Arthur said slowly.\n\n“You don’t know much, magician,” Anzu sneered.\n\n“Well, if you know Hnikarr, you can clear up the little debate between me and Gerald. You’ve known it for centuries. Will it care about these humans’ lives?”\n\nEveryone looked at Mae and Jamie. Mae still had her eyes shut, blood sliding down her throat, bloody hands clenched. Gerald was whispering in Jamie’s ear, and there was a change coming slow as dawn over Jamie’s face. He was starting to look angry. Nick knew them both, as he had known very few people in his life. He could remember them in a hundred different ways, Jamie frightened in a bar in Salisbury, Mae supporting him outside the House of Mezentius.\n\nHe wondered if that mattered.\n\nAnzu snorted. “Why should he?”\n\nAnzu should know.\n\n“As I thought,” Arthur said. “Humanity is not something that can be built.” He turned to Nick. “You are not my son. You are not something that can feel,” he whispered. “Your own mother is lying there dead. And you don’t care.”\n\nNick looked across the floor strewn with magical circles to where what remained of Mum lay. All he could see was a heap of burned clothes and hair. She was dead. He had hated her because he’d thought it was her fault they were being hunted, and that had been a lie. She had hated him for wearing her son’s face, which was a lie too.\n\nThere was the cold thought in Nick’s mind, somewhere in the gray absence of feeling, that he shouldn’t waste time with humans. They didn’t last.\n\n“Laura,” Arthur snapped. “Gerald. Bring them to me.”\n\nLaura shoved Mae almost onto the blade of the knife with every step. Jamie followed her without Gerald having to push him at all.\n\nArthur glanced at them and then turned back to Nick with eyes that had been wilder every second since Mum died.\n\n“I know what you are,” he said. “A demon, a creature defined by your actions and desires. I made a bargain with you, knowing what you are. You’ll do what I want because it’s the best thing for both of us. Don’t tell me you care if these two live or die.”\n\nNick thought of Anzu’s words. He had sounded certain; sounded as if he knew who Nick was, what demons were. Nick was not certain of anything except for unavoidable realities like Mum on the floor.\n\nMaybe he never had felt anything. Maybe it was just that Alan had always expected him to feel something, and he had convinced himself that he could.\n\nHe didn’t get a chance to answer Arthur. All the lights went out and they were plunged into what, except for the dim, unearthly light of Anzu’s circle, amounted to total darkness.\n\nSomeone screamed, and Black Arthur swore. Close by there was movement in the dark, shadows stirring within shadows, and Nick knew that Mae and Jamie had dived for the floor. Laura cursed, and Nick thought he saw a smaller movement: her hands grasping for Mae an instant too late.\n\nEveryone was in motion. Nobody was watching but Nick, so nobody else saw the small slice of paler shadow when the door opened and shut.\n\nBlack Arthur’s voice struck through the darkness like a whip. “Pull yourselves together! There’s no need to panic.”\n\nNick threw his head back and let himself laugh. It was a slow, delighted laugh, rolling cold as the sea and washing through the whole room. He’d used the laugh before to make people shiver and turn pale.\n\nHe knew now that his laugh did not sound human.\n\n“What?” Arthur snapped, and then, as the low laugh continued, his nerve broke and he shouted, “What?”\n\nNick leaned forward in the dark and whispered, “You don’t know my brother.”\n\nHe was still speaking when the first shot was fired.\n\nIt was too dark in that room, with night and a summer storm closing in, to see a thing. There were too many magicians and they were moving too much, and Black Arthur was shouting orders and causing even more confusion. The weak shimmer of Anzu’s balefire only seemed to deepen the shadows in the recesses of the room.\n\nAlan had planned this ambush well.\n\nThe first shot sounded like bone cracking, and it was followed by a thump. A man screamed, and Nick started to laugh again. The sound should cover the sound of Alan moving. Besides, it was frightening people, and that might help.\n\nHe saw another flurry of movement beside him and strongly suspected that Gerald had pulled Laura quietly to the ground. He could tell Alan where they were, once more pressing threats were dealt with.\n\n“Somebody catch that boy!” shouted Black Arthur, and from his charms and amulets came a sudden low, smoky haze of color. It was red like the embers of a dying fire, shot here and there with moody purple. The power outlined the shape «linlet of Arthur’s hands in darkness.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nNíu giữ thanh xuân sau tuổi 40 tại nhà!

Arthur leaped sideways at the sound of the shot, and the streak of magic flew off through the air at random. It struck harmlessly against one of the paneled walls.\n\nAfter a moment the light of Arthur’s power faded into darkness, and once more the only light was that of Anzu’s circle. Acting from what Nick assumed was sheer mischief, Anzu had lowered his flames considerably, and the dull glow provided hardly any light at all. Nick had excellent night vision. He could not imagine how little the humans could see and how afraid they must be.\n\n“Mae and Jamie got down,” he let Alan know. “Kill them all.”\n\nThe room was too small, and the magicians were too powerful. Sooner or later Alan would be caught, but Nick thought it wouldn’t do any harm to have the magicians hear that.\n\nThere was another scream and a burst of frenzied movement. Nick thought that someone had tripped over a body.\n\nIn the confusion, even Nick lost track of where Alan was. Then he felt a disturbance in the trap that had closed on him, a sudden living presence in the icy walls around him. There was breathing where there had been only silence, and the first thought that came to Nick, clear and calm, was that a human had strayed into his circle and he should kill him.\n\n“Nick,” said Alan, under his breath.\n\nHe was standing close to whisper to him. Nick supposed that it was easier in the darkness. Alan had not even been able to look at him when it was light.\n\n“Don’t worry,” Alan continued, his voice rapid and soft. “I’m going to get you out.”\n\nNick listened with detachment to his own whisper back, about as human and reassuring as a whisper from the grave. “I’m not worried.”\n\nHe could feel Alan trembling in the darkness, and for a moment he thought that Alan was simply afraid of him. Then Alan stepped in toward him, and he felt Alan’s hand, the one that was not holding the gun, gentle in his hair. He turned his face into the touch and Alan, as if he was leaning over Nick’s bed when Nick was very small, pressed a warm, swift kiss on Nick’s cheek.\n\nThen he was gone, and the circle was cold, silent, and still once more.\n\n“Someone go see what that wretched boy’s done to the fuse box,” Arthur commanded. “I’ll deal with him.”\n\nThere was a movement in the darkness, and then a silhouette against the open door, providing a perfect target. Alan’s gun rang out again, and there was another thump. “Sure about that?” Nick asked, grinning in the dark.\n\n“Who was that?” Arthur demanded, sounding more offended than shaken, as if Alan had dropped a spoon in a restaurant rather than a person with a bullet. “Was that Charles? Charles!”\n\n“I wouldn’t bother calling,” Nick advised. “My brother doesn’t miss.”\n\nThere was a mess of magic in the air, colors crisscrossing like scribbles of crayon over a black page. Magicians were hitting each other. There was more screaming, and in the light of magic, like the light shed by dozens of fireworks in the sky, Nick saw Mae and Jamie on the floor, Mae with her arm protectively over Jamie’s head, and Jamie with his arm around Mae’s waist. Right next to Jamie lay Gerald, holding on to Jamie’s shoulder.\n\nAgainst the magic-stained darkness, Alan and Arthur were standing, looking at each other. Magic was coiled around Arthur’s fists and arms like bright, living ropes, and Alan had his gun pointed at Black Arthur’s face.\n\nAlan’s glasses reflected the multicolored light. His voice cut through screams.\n\n“I want you to know I appreciate this, Arthur,” he said. “You’ve made sure my plan worked out perfectly.”\n\nArthur was standing very still. He’d seen Alan shoot now; he wasn’t treating him as lightly as he had before, as a child whose tears he could wipe away while he laughed at him. He was working out how to bring Alan down without risking being shot.\n\n“Oh yes,” he sneered. “I’m sure that getting your precious brother trapped in a magicians’ circle was your plan all along.”\n\nAlan stared at him impassively. “Well, not all along. I was hoping that someone at the Goblin Market might be able to trap him in a circle for me, but she refused to try. So I had to do this on my own. I couldn’t let Nick know any of it — I wanted him to be human for as long as he could. We had humans in the house, and I was hoping he’d make friends with them. I knew you wouldn’t stop hunting him. I knew I had to make sure that no magician could ever touch him again. I took the second demon’s mark because I knew that he’d help me hunt magicians. You took him? I brought him to your damned house and your damned circle. I chose this!”\n\nHe took a step closer to Black Arthur, who was just waiting for Alan’s attention to waver. He was just one human, alone with magicians closing in on him, and Nick could not understand the blazing, triumphant look on his face.\n\nIt seemed to infuriate Arthur. “And why would you do that?”\n\n“So I could do this,” Alan answered calmly, and continued in a clear voice, “I call on the one I gave the name Nicholas Ryves!”\n\nIt shocked the magicians enough so that the magic stilled in their hands, and the room fell once more into relative darkness. That was broken by a crackle of power and light from Black Arthur’s hands, magic resting against his palms like two lightning bolts.\n\n“What are you doing?” he shouted at Alan. “You don’t call on demons like that. You have to call on them using their true names!”\n\n“You’re an idiot,” Alan shouted back. “You’ve worked with demons your whole life, and you still haven’t figured it out? Why would demons have true names? They don’t even have a spoken language. That’s not how you call them. They don’t answer because they believe that’s their true name. They answer because you believe it! I call on the one they called Hnikarr in the west, I call on the one I call my brother. I call Nicholas Ryves!”\n\nAlan was no dancer. It should not have worked, except that Nick was already in a magicians’ circle, drawn by magicians, calling on and reflecting the power of the true Obsidian Circle that they had moved from Exeter to London.\n\nJust as Alan had planned.\n\nThe magicians’ circle tightened, as if the walls that Nick could neither see nor break through were closing in. It was more than that. It felt as if he had been in a trap all along that was formed of a dozen different steel strands, and he only realized they were there now, when every strand went taut. They held him at his wrists and ankles, they wrapped around his head. He felt for a moment as if he was on puppet strings; his throat constricted as if he was held on a choke chain.\n\nHe remembered Merris Cromwell’s voice, saying, Exorcism means naming the demon and commanding it.\n\nThe feeling was not entirely unpleasant. Now that his power had been called on, Nick could feel it surging within him. His body was thrilling to it, like a rush of adrenaline, and all along the lines in his circle there was magic rising.\n\nHe looked at Alan, and their eyes met over a sea of white balefire, glittering like snow and moving like light.\n\nSoft as the crackle of the fire, Nick said, “What do you command?”\n\nTell me to kill them all, Nick thought.\n\nHe turned his head at the sound of Arthur’s voice, hoarse and desperate. “What are you going to do?”\n\nIt turned Nick’s head because it puzzled him. He did not think Arthur would sound that desperate if he were simply afraid for himself. Arthur was too arrogant for that, so that left the question: What did he think Alan was going to do?\n\nArthur was moving toward Alan like a hunting cat, deceptively slow and poised to leap.\n\n“I don’t care what you think of me,” he said, begging now. “Not one of us would do something like this. You don’t know what these things are capable of. You would doom the whole world.”\n\nThere was something everyone knew about demons. Magicians called them into circles or into bodies, kept them trapped, kept their powers limited. Not even a magician would let a demon go free.\n\nAlan’s plan was to make sure that no magician could ever touch Nick again.\n\n“Don’t do this!” Arthur roared.\n\nDon’t do this, Nick thought. Arthur is right. I don’t know what I would do. I cannot be trusted.\n\nAs usual, he could not find the words to say what he meant.\n\nAlan ignored Arthur completely, his gaze fixed on Nick. He looked calm and absolutely determined.\n\n“Nicholas Ryves,” he said, making the third time a charm, and then he smiled. “I set you free.”\n\nArthur leaped for Alan an instant too late, knocking him to the ground, his hand over Alan’s mouth as if he could stop words that had already been spoken.\n\nThe walls of the circle crashed down as if they had always been too light and fragile to hold anyone, and Nick’s magic came rushing in a white roaring tide over the floor. The flood covered magical signs and human bodies alike, and Nick found the center of this unlimited power and threw it at Black Arthur’s heart. Black Arthur screamed, and Nick spread his arms and broke free of his last prison. He rushed, complete at last and free at last, out into his new world.\n\nHe left the body behind him on the floor.\n\n17\n\nKnowing the Words\n\nNICK WENT RACING THROUGH THE CITY. HE WOUND through the narrow lanes and broad streets of London, insubstantial as smoke, curling around humans, who shivered and looked around with wide scared eyes for the cause of their sudden fear. London at night was a glittering playground full of humans and the shiny toys they’d built around them. Nick could have leveled it all.\n\nHe went flying up around the spires of tall, aggressively new buildings and let himself plummet in the sheer, sudden drop down to the parliamentary houses that stood in lines of gray stone. There was a hum of human noise everywhere; Nick wasn’t used to understanding it.\n\nHe moved to a place higher up and farther away from the humans, to the familiar ground of Tower Bridge. There was a break in the clouds there, with the light of the setting sun still streaming through. Nick wreathed himself like mist around the medieval towers turned into fairy-tale gold by the sinking sun, connected by soaring blue arches. His shadow spread across the sparkling river, turning it into a deep, steady stream of darkness that snaked through the whole city.\n\nIt was his city now.\n\nNick spun, and spun the air with him, whirled sky and clouds around his fist and into a roiling gray mass. He clapped and thunder echoed in his ears; he broke dark holes in the clouds and sent lightning blazing through them. Light and sound crashed in the air around him, as if he were caught in some terrible car accident, and he rolled through the storm and laughed again.\n\nThe clouds formed layer upon layer of thick gray blankets, wrapping Nick up warm and safe in the broken sky. He could do anything he wanted. Every moment of fury, every impulse toward destruction that he had ever had, could now be vented on the world.\n\nThunder struck against the clouds, ringing out in triumph.\n\nHe’d taken the gamble and won. No magician had a hold over him now, nor ever would again. Liannan had been wrong to advise caution. Liannan…she had seen him when he was helpless and ignorant and bound to that human body. She had tried to be kind to him. He could find her now, do something for her, and tell her that he remembered everything. He did remember everything.\n\nHe did not remember ever thinking in words before. He did not remember ever thinking of himself as having a name before. Names were human things, important because humans used names in order to use you. A name was a collar and a chain. Nick didn’t have a name.\n\nNick saw the problem with that last thought almost immediately.\n\nHe shook it off irritably, reached down and tried to burn the realization away with a flash of lightning, burning in the sky over London. It crackled in the air below him and thunder rolled above him, a steady, soothing growl, the storm speaking to him without words.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nNíu giữ thanh xuân sau tuổi 40 tại nhà!

He had to stop thinking like this. He’d been taken and indoctrinated by those humans, but he knew everything and he could do anything now.\n\nHe stopped and tried to think of something he wanted to do. The storm had no answers for him.\n\nThe human world had been the demons’ goal for so long, Nick was not sure what to do with it now he had it. The magicians were their masters, promising relief from the pain as long as you gave them obedience, and every demon dreamed of being a master instead. Being the one with all the power, who could terrify and rule the humans.\n\nDemons did not see that there was any position in the human world but the position of master or slave. Now he was no longer a slave. He could crush the people in this world if he felt like it — but what would he do then? He could create a hundred storms like this one. He owned this night and all those trapped in it.\n\nIt was dark, and a little cold. He felt tired and chilled by everything that had happened today. He wanted to go home to Alan, eat cereal on the sofa, and sleep in his own bed.\n\nThat was what humans did, with the whole world laid out before them every day.\n\nHe buried the towers in storm clouds. He could set the river Thames on fire if he chose, reduce it to steam in the riverbed.\n\nHe could not go back to a human. Going back to a human would be like a beaten dog escaping its chains and then crawling back to its kennel, whining for its owner.\n\nThat was a human sort of comparison, though. He had to stop thinking like a human. He had to stop thinking in words. He did not remember being taught words. Sometime in the distant past he had learned that a sound meant an idea, a particular sound meant a particular idea, and sound and idea could never be disentangled and independent again. He remembered how they all used to laugh at words, to which humans attributed so much power, as if sound and air could possibly mean an idea, or an individual.\n\nHe thought of the name Alan, and what that meant.\n\nIt seemed that the word home, once learned, was hard to forget.\n\nBlack Arthur had been right, though. He had never been human, never felt things in a human way, never been completely comfortable with a language made of words. Nick wondered if the girls brought up with the wolves had ever been comfortable with the wolves or humans. He wondered if they had wanted to go back to the wolves once they were rescued, and what the wolves would have done if they had.\n\nIt was easiest to be with your own kind. Nick thought of winking at the possessed man in Mezentius House, and how Alan must have seen that and run away to hide his horror and fear, seeing his demon brother belonging with the demons.\n\nNick had gone after him. It had been all right.\n\nThat had been before he knew. He thought of Black Arthur telling him, You are not something that can feel. Nick knew what he meant now. A demon had no capacity for warmth.\n\nAlan had let him go. Nick would never have taken that kind of risk with his own world, with his own kind. The humans were not like they were, not powerful and logical, not barren and bleak like the endless stretches of space in the demon world. He thought of Mae’s body heat against him, anchoring him while he crossed running water. He thought of Liannan and her cold mouth, how she had wanted a moment of warmth to take back with her to their world.\n\nThings were what they were. They couldn’t be changed. Something eternally cold could not turn himself inside out, turn his face away from everything he was, and should not long for something brief and stupid and senseless and warm.\n\nEverything was changed now. He knew the truth. He knew what he was.\n\nThere was no way back, not ever.\n\nHe let the storm clouds dissolve and the winds die away, and in the gathering quiet it occurred to him that he had left Alan in a nest of magicians.\n\nHe went back faster than sound or light, fled uncaring through a city he could have owned to the one place that mattered, then came in through the roof and hovered over the floor where the bodies lay.\n\nThere were people standing. Alan was not one of them.\n\nHe was lying on the floor, half-covered by Black Arthur’s body. Black Arthur’s eyes were open and blood was coming out of his eyes, his ears, and his nose. He was dead.\n\nNick had been angry, but surely not angry enough to hurt Alan. Surely he had struck down Arthur before the man had a chance to touch Alan.\n\nThere were other magicians in this room who were still alive, and therefore still a threat. Mae and Jamie were facing them hand in hand, defenseless, and facing them just the same.\n\nNick was about to whirl on the magicians when he noticed that none of them were actually attacking. The most that seemed to be happening was that Gerald was standing toe-to-toe with another magician, and that man was talking loudly.\n\n“We should kill them all!” he said, and Nick pinpointed the man with his power. It would be easy as pinning a butterfly to the wall and watching it die.\n\nGerald reached up in his friendly, casual way and took the man by the throat.\n\n“Do you think you give the orders around here now, Mark?” he inquired lightly. “Are you challenging me?”\n\n“No,” Mark said. “No, of course not, I simply assumed—”\n\n“Don’t,” Gerald advised, and smiled his shy smile into the older man’s face. “We’re going to leave now. We’re going to let them live. What do you have to say about that?”\n\n“I — nothing,” said Mark.\n\nGerald let him go and turned him like a child, giving him a solid push between the shoulder blades in the direction of the door. The other magicians took the hint and, even though some cast venomous glances behind Gerald’s back, they all started filing toward the exit. Some had to step over the bodies on their way.\n\nGerald gave a small sigh of relief, as if a potentially awkward situation had been happily resolved, and turned to face Mae and Jamie with his hands in his pockets.\n\n“I gave you your lives,” he said. “Remember that. I don’t give without expecting a return. I’ll be watching you.” His eyes lingered on the healing cut he’d made along Mae’s cheek, something cold in them surfacing for a moment. Then he was smiling again. “And I will be back to collect.”\n\n“What, our lives?” Jamie exclaimed, moving in front of Mae.\n\nGerald shrugged. “Come now, Jamie,” he said, eyeing him with what seemed to be a considerable amount of amusement. “Do you think I would go after one of my own?”\n\nJamie reached behind him and found Mae’s hand again. “I’m not one of yours.”\n\n“Sure you are,” Gerald murmured. “You just don’t know it yet. Are you going to feel safe waiting for everyone else to discover your little secret, watching your sister grow afraid of you, knowing that a demon’s on the loose out there? You just might be glad to see me when I come back.”\n\nHe nodded his head at them in farewell, turning to follow his magicians out into the corridor.\n\nHe paused at the door and let his gaze sweep up and down Mae, that glint of coldness appearing again like a knife carelessly hidden by someone who would not mind too much if people saw it and were afraid.\n\n“Of course,” he murmured, “you might not be.”\n\nHe winked at Jamie and shut the door.\n\nNick did not kill any of them. There were enough bodies lying on that floor for Alan to see when he woke. What Nick did was drift toward one of the bodies, the one lying in the magicians’ circle. All the other circles were empty. Anzu had gone when the man who’d called him died.\n\nThere was no fire left in the circle, and no life in the body. The chest was rising and falling, but the open eyes looked dead.\n\nThey were blue eyes, like the eyes of his dead parents. They were all dead, that magical blue-eyed family. The child had never had a chance to live.\n\nNick surveyed the vacant body dispassionately. He knew it, could remember the feeling of every muscle and sinew. He knew where every mole was, knew every line of the face. It was just that he also knew he did not belong in it, and did not really need it.\n\nHe remembered again that time on the river, and the persistent nagging feeling that his body did not belong to him. It was a hundred times worse now when he tried to force his way inside. The body felt heavy, like the earth humans were supposed to be made out of, and he felt as if he was entirely the wrong sort of material to be put into it. It was as if someone was trying to squeeze too much water into a cardboard box.\n\nFor a moment he felt as if the body might burst, but then he seemed to settle back into it, his energy running comfortably along the lines of the body again and finding a way to fit. Then it was just a matter of remembering that he had to move the limbs in order to move again. It seemed such a clumsy way to do things, and he levered himself up with arms that felt like rubber.\n\nNick squinted, and the world came into focus.\n\nJamie was standing by the window, saying, “The storm just stopped,” in a wondering, detached sort of way. He turned at the sound of Nick getting awkwardly to his feet.\n\nAt least stepping out of the circle was no problem now.\n\n“Nick woke up,” Jamie told Mae as Nick walked, surer with every step, across the floor toward his brother. His body was working well enough that when he got to Alan, he went down on his knees beside him, and nothing had ever been so easy.\n\nAlan was lying on his side, and he was still breathing. He had just been knocked out when Arthur tackled him, Nick told himself. He was all right; he had to be.\n\nWhat Nick did do was reach out and wipe away the trickle of blood at the corner of Black Arthur’s mouth. Then he leaned over, passed his bloody fingers over Alan’s leg, and watched the demon’s mark fade away.\n\nNick did not touch his brother again. He just stayed by his side and waited for him to wake up.\n\nAfter a moment, he slanted a look over at Mae. She had not stirred when Jamie told her about the storm or about Nick. She was standing over the body of the man she had killed. Nick remembered now — she had killed him and taken the mark off Jamie. He made an effort to catch her eye, and when he did he smiled.\n\n“Well done,” he said.\n\nMae looked sick. Nick realized that somehow he had said the wrong thing, and he was just thinking that Alan would have said the right thing when he saw Alan stir.\n\nThe first thing Alan’s eyes fell on when he opened them was Mae, and immediately he sat up and said, “Oh, Mae. I’m sorry.”\n\nFor some reason, that seemed to be the right thing. Mae almost smiled, and at the sound of Alan’s voice, Jamie stopped looking lost in troubled thought and looked instead at his sister. He went over to her at once, looked anxiously up at her, then reached out and wrapped a protective arm around her shoulders.\n\nShe smiled properly then, dropping a kiss on his head. That was good, Nick thought, and then Alan said, “Where’s Nick?” and all thought of the others was lost.\n\nFor the first time since he had heard the truth, he turned and looked into his brother’s eyes.\n\nAlan looked enormously relieved to see him and scared to death. Nick looked at him and knew what Alan was seeing: blank black eyes set in an expressionless face, and no way to guess what was going on behind those eyes. Alan had flinched violently away from him when waking from dreams of demons. Alan had deliberately unleashed him on the world.\n\nWhatever Nick did now, Alan would think it was his fault.\n\nNick decided it was good that he had not allowed Alan to wake and see that empty body. He could be here. He could do that much.\n\n“Nick,” Alan said, and his eyes traveled from Nick’s face to Mum’s body, lying too close to them. Alan flinched back, as if the sight hurt him. He was shaking a little. “Nick,” he said again, and his voice was shaking a little too. “Nick, talk to me.”\n\nNick shook too, but not from horror or grief. He just felt cold, empty of the right words. He knew how to talk, but he did not know what to say. He could not give Alan what he did not have. He could not be human, even for Alan.\n\nHe allowed himself to remember Black Arthur’s voice once more. Black Arthur had said that a demon was a creature defined by its actions and its desires.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nGiảm cân họ phạm giúp thổi bay 5-7kg tại nhà chỉ sau vài tuần.\nDongytaybac\nTấp nập người mua chiếc đồng hồ bản sao khi nó giảm 90% hôm nay\nWatchthuysichinhhang"

He reached out, the way humans did, and slid his arm around Nick’s shoulders. “Okay,” he said again, and Nick could tell by the trembling in his voice that he was crying.\n\nHis tears fell warm on Nick’s hair, and he slid warm fingers through Nick’s hair to follow them. Nick closed his tearless demon’s eyes and leaned into the embrace.\n\n“What are we going to do?” he asked.\n\nAlan whispered, “We’re going to go home,” and Nick nodded, abandoned words for just a moment, and bowed his head as Alan stroked his hair. He was not made human, but he began slowly to feel as if this body could be his again. He felt grounded and at home already under his brother’s gentle human hands.\n\nPROMOTED CONTENT\nUng thư trực tràng chỉ vì trĩ?
